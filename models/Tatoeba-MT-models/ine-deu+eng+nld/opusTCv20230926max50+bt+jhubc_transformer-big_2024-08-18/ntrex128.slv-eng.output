Members of the Welsh Assembly worry that they are “like Muppets”
Some members of the Assembly are appalled by the proposal to rename themselves MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was due to plans to change the name of the assembly to the Valizan Parliament.
Members of the Assembly throughout the political spectrum are concerned that they will smile.
A member of the Labour congregation said that they are concerned about their group, “because the name rhymes with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, twp means stupid, and wwp means cockatoo.
A member of the Plaid Cymru assembly said that their group as a whole was “unsatisfied” and suggested other options.
The Valencian Conservative said his group was "open-minded" about the name change, while noting that there was a small difference in pronunciation between the words MWP and Muppet.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter "w" is similar to the pronunciation of the letter "u" in the Yorkshire dialect.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing a draft legislation to introduce name changes, stated: “Of course, the final decision on possible descriptors for members of the Assembly will have to be made by the members themselves.”
The Welsh Assembly was empowered by the Government of Wales Act 2017 to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals and received broad support for the appointment of the Assembly of the Valizan Parliament.
For the members of the Assembly, the Commission chose the name ‘Welsh Parliament Member’ or ‘WMP’, but the ‘MWP’ option was the most supported in the public consultation.
Members of the Assembly are obviously proposing other options, but reaching consensus will be a difficult task for the presiding officer, Elin Jones, who has to submit a draft legislation on amendments within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will also include other changes to the functioning of the Assembly, including rules on the incompatibility of the function of members of the Assembly and the formation of a system of committees.
The members of the Assembly will participate in the debate on the legislation in the final vote on their names.
Macedonians will vote on renaming the country
Voters will vote on Sunday to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
By voting, they want to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbours represents the right to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its requests for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite on the name change, said he would not consider the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is just the price they have to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells in St. Martin’s church have been silenced as churches in Harlem face problems
“The older people I spoke to say there used to be a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
“There is no one or the other today.”
He explained that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“People are different these days.
Bars are no longer neighborhood living rooms, where people go regularly.”
With the churches, however, he is worried that the money from the sale of funds will not last as long as the leaders expect, and that they will soon be at the beginning again.
He added that churches could be replaced with residential buildings with a joint administration (condominiums) where people will live who will not help the shelters in the neighborhood that are still left.
“The vast majority of people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and therefore the day will soon come when all these churches will be closed, as it is unlikely that the people who will move into these condominiums will become members of these churches.”
Both churches built white religious communities before Harlem became a Black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin’s a decade later.
The original White Methodist Church community moved in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by a black religious community, who had worshiped nearby.
St. Martin’s was taken over by a black religious community led by the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who, on 125th Street, Harlem’s main shopping street, led a boycott of merchants who refused to hire or support blacks.
The fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Johnson's father's parishioners were planning to rebuild, they ordered bells to ring.
The venerable David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin’s Church, proudly called the bells “the bells of the poor.”
The expert, who came across them in July, called them a little different: “cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument.”
Expert Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also pointed out that these were the first bells to be played by a dark-polar musician, Dionisio A. Link, who went to Riverside Church 18 years ago, where he rang larger bells.
Mr. Merriweather said he had not been replaced at St. Martin's Church.
In the last few months, the Church of St. Martin’s has had a complicated history with architects and contractors; some were brought by church laity and others by the diocese.
Zakristia - the administrative body of the parish, composed of laymen - wrote to the diocese in July to ensure that the diocese would "try to pass on the costs" to the parish, even though the parish was not involved in the employment of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the transparency of the diocese.
Sea Dog Injures 13-Year-Old Man While Hunting For Hummingbirds In California
Officials say a California shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old while hunting lobsters at the opening of the lobster hunting season on Saturday.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon’s Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he dived with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help, then swam to him with a group and helped pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was just excited because he caught the lobster, and then he found that he was screaming “He bit me!
“He bit me!”
When he came to the boy, Hammel noticed that his entire keychain was torn.
“I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” he added.
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he remains in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer from the water, Captain Larry Giles, said in a statement to the media that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered serious injuries to the upper part of the corps.
They were responsible for 48 hours blocking access from Ponto Beach in Casablado to Swami’s Beach in Ecinitas for investigation and security.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury’s comes to Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty corners as they have in department stores, and with expert staff.
As part of entering the UK beauty market, which is worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and is still growing as sales of clothing and household appliances decline, larger beauty corners will be tested in 11 stores across the country, and next year in more stores if they prove successful.
They decided to invest in beauty products because supermarkets are looking for ways to fill the shelves they previously used for televisions, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury’s says it will double the range of its beauty products to 3,000 products and include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing range of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees brands will also gain more space in areas with brands similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also reviving its boutique range of cosmetics, so most of the products are vegan – something that younger shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test the concession at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first opening last week in Croydon, South London, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, by the end of the year.
Due to online shopping and everyday shopping for small quantities of food in local stores, supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said retail stores will be similar to supermarkets as the supermarket chain tries to fight off discounts on Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
The Sainsbury’s Group has opened Argos outlets in hundreds of stores, as well as Habitat stores, since buying both chains two years ago, increasing food sales and making takeovers more profitable.
Previous attempts by the supermarket to renovate its departments with cosmetic and pharmaceutical products have ended unsuccessfully.
Sainsbury’s embarked on a joint venture with the Boots chain in the early 21st century, but the bond ended after a dispute over the sharing of profits from drugstores in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold its pharmaceutical company with 281 stores to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
They said Lloyds will play its part in this plan as it is expected to expand the range of luxury skincare brands in four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve changed the look and feel of our beauty corners to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who will be available for advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now an interesting beauty destination that poses a challenge to the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones says he’s angry that Holly Willoughby has pulled out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal.
The Dragons Day star is furious that TV host Holly Willoughby has pulled out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million business with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their clothing and accessories brand Truly.
The company of the business couple was compared with the brand Goop Gwyneth Paltrow.
The host of This Morning, 37, announced on Instagram that she is retiring.
Holly Willoughby has angered the star of Peter Jones’ Dragons Day show as she has recently pulled out of their lucrative lifestyle brand deal to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was “angry” when a golden girl on television on Tuesday, during a tense meeting at his company’s Marlow headquarters in Buckinghamshire, admitted that because of her new deals — worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million — she no longer has enough time to devote to their brand.
The company was compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand and predicted that it would double its assets, estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving the Truly brand, Jones flew out of the UK to one of her holiday homes.
The source said: “Truly was by far the most important thing for Holly.
This would be her long-term future, with which she would survive for the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw completely astounded everyone involved.
On Tuesday, no one could believe what was happening, as the opening was so close.
At the company’s headquarters in Marlow, there is a warehouse full of goods ready for sale.”
Experts say the departure of This Morning, one of Britain’s most intriguing unions for banks, would cost the company millions due to large investments in products, from pillows and candles to clothing and accessories, and additional delays in opening.
This can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin were good friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined them as president in March.
The couple went on vacation together, and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV’s I’m A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his business affairs.”
It’s hard to talk, and then we fall in love.
He joked about criticism from the media over comments that seem “non-presidential” to some, and a positive opinion about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump resign?
Trump, in his mocking “journalist” voice, said:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He pointed out that Kim showed interest in the second meeting. Their first meeting in Singapore in June, Trump called a major step towards the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at a UN General Assembly meeting that North Korea does not see an “adequate response” from the US to previous North Korean disarmament measures.
He stressed that instead, the United States continues to impose sanctions, which continue to put pressure on it.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
“We are doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
“We wanted to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
We have a good relationship now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results — they stopped testing missiles, helped liberate hostages, and brought home the remains of U.S. soldiers.
He also defended his unusual approach in a conversation about relations with Kim.
“It can be very presidential, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we have 200 people standing here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated island, hundreds dead
For example, in addressing the consequences of the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told they did not need their help.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok were displaced, they did not declare a natural disaster, which is a condition for sending international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have been very clear that they do not require international assistance, so the situation is somewhat complicated,” Sumbungova said.
Save the Children is a team that will travel to Palu, but it is not yet clear whether foreign staff will be able to help on the ground.
Sutopu, a representative of the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palau and determining whether they will allow international agencies to help.
Given that earthquakes in Indonesia are permanent, the country remains completely unprepared for the rage of nature.
Although shelters were built in Aceh after the tsunami, this is not common practice on other coasts.
The apparent absence of a warning siren behind the tsunami in Palu was likely to have contributed to the loss of life, although the warning was valid.
Traveling between many Indonesian islands is a challenge even in the best of times.
Due to natural disasters, logistics is even more complex.
A hospital ship anchored in Lombok to help victims of the earthquake is sailing towards Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of a new disaster.
President Joko Widodo put the improvement of Indonesia’s destroyed infrastructure at the forefront of his election campaign and spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the financial deficit poses a problem for Joka’s administration in re-election next year.
Joko is also facing pressure from long-standing tensions between sects in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands evacuated from their homes as Christian and Muslim mobs fought in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge hit for late draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London scored a 89th-minute save for Liverpool before defeating Chelsea in the Premier League.
Sturridge accepted the hand of Xherdan Shaqiri a good 25 meters ahead of Chelsea's goal in the back of his team 1-0.
He put the ball to his left and fired a shot at the far gate.
The arrow traveled high above the penal area towards the upper right corner of the door.
The ball eventually landed through goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the goal.
“I was just trying to get in the right position for the ball and players like Shaq are always pulling it forward as much as they can, so I was just trying to get as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming, so after one touch I didn’t think much and decided to just shoot.”
Chelsea led 1-0 at half-time with a 25-minute run by Belgian player Eden Hazard.
In this fifth-placed action, the Blues forward handed the ball back to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> and fled to Liverpool's half.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> quickly handed in the middle and glazed forward.
Then he passed nicely through the defense and Hazard escaped into the penitentiary.
Hazard overtook the defense and shot with his left foot at the far gate through Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play Videoton in the Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the state accident agency reported on Sunday morning.
A spokesman for Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference that many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings because of a 7.5-magnitude earthquake on Friday.
Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is dotted with ruins of buildings.
Police arrested 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman stabbed to death
Police have launched an investigation into the murder after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 7:55 a.m. in the Grayson Mews building on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police are calling on all those who have been in the area and have seen or heard anything to make a statement.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is at an early stage, but I urge everyone who has been near John Street in Birkenhead and has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also call on everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something on camera footage, to get in touch with us, as they may have information that is crucial to our investigation.”
A police official confirmed the woman was a resident of Birkenhead and the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, friends came to the scene of the crime, who thought they knew the woman, and asked where they found her in the morning.
Investigations are underway, and the police are informing the woman's family.
The taxi driver, who lives in Grayson Mews, was just trying to return to his apartment, but police told him that no one should enter or leave the building.
When he found out what had happened, he was speechless.
Residents have now been told that it may take several hours for them to re-enter.
A policeman was heard explaining to the man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene, all in tears.
He keeps repeating, “It’s so horrible.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were inside the cordon, and another was just outside.
A number of police officers stood inside the cordon and watched the apartment block.
Anyone who has any information should write to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 and provide log 247 dated September 30.
The Cromwell statue in parliament has become the latest memorial target of a dispute over “rewriting history”
Its removal would be a poetic right to destroy many English cultural and religious artifacts by fanatical followers of Puritanism.
But the Cromwell Society called Crick’s proposal “foolishness” and an “attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In today’s debate about the removal of statues, it has become clear that the image of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster will become a target.”
The iconoclasm in the English Civil Wars Cromwell neither commissioned nor performed.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor of the previous century.
The brilliant presentation of Cromwell, prepared by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, bears witness to 19th-century opinion and is part of a personality historiography that some believe is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is seen by many (perhaps even more in the late 19th century than today) as a protector of parliament from external pressure, in his case of the monarchy of course.
Whether this is a completely accurate performance is the subject of constant historical debate.
Clearly, in the middle of the 17th century, the dispute shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable individual who represents one side of this division.
His achievements from the time he was Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and commemorated.”
Pig Killer Kills Chinese Farmer to Death
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwest China.
The man, identified only by the surname "Yuan", was found dead with a cut artery and covered in blood near a piggy bank at a market in the town of Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pig farm is being prepared for the vaccination of pigs on a pig farm in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, on 30 May 2005.
According to reports, she and her cousin arrived from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and the door of a neighboring pigeon was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the piggy bank with a bloody sponge.
A forensic investigation has confirmed that a 250-kilogram pig slaughtered the farmer to death.
“The cousin’s legs were bloody and thin,” a cousin named “Wu” was quoted as saying in the Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance footage showed that Yuang came to the market on Thursday at 4.40 a.m. to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that attacked Yuan was neither his nor his cousin's.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked up so as not to attack anyone else while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market leaders are expected to negotiate compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of swine attacks on humans have already been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, in which the man suffered serious physical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-kilogram pig squeezed a Welsh farmer by a tractor, but then his wife drove the animal away.
After pigs ate an Oregon farmer in 2012, another Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually attacking, but a taste for blood can act as a “trigger.”
“We’d just play.
They're like little children, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
We just need to show them enough respect,” he said.
In the southwestern United States, the remnants of Hurricane Rosa cause heavy rain.
Hurricane Rosa is forecasting to move toward colder waters off the northern coast of Mexico and weaken.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring flooding to the north of Mexico and the southwestern United States.
Rosa is a Category 1 hurricane with a wind speed of 137 km/h from 5:00 a.m. on Sunday morning and is located 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenie in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move northwards on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure zone over the Pacific Ocean is strengthening, moving eastward to the west coast of the United States. Rosa will approach the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm and will push high tropical moisture northward to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture, which will mix with a low-pressure area, will create abundant rainfall in the wider southwest area in the coming days.
Locally, from 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, flooding, and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Due to high tropical humidity, rainfall in some places will approach 50 to 75 mm per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwestern parts, especially over much of Arizona, rainfall is expected to range from 50 to 100 mm.
Flooding is possible due to the rapid deterioration of the situation due to the scattered nature of the tropical rain.
It would be very reckless to walk into the desert when there is a threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can turn the canyons into erratic rivers, and storms will bring local winds and dust into the air.
The approaching low-pressure zone will bring local rain to parts of the coast of Southern California.
Precipitation above 12 mm is possible, which can cause less landslides and slippery roads.
This will be the first rain for the region during the rainy season.
A few scattered tropical plains will begin to approach Arizona on Saturday late afternoon and early Monday morning, late Monday and Tuesday, and rainfall will spread.
Heavy rain will spread to all sides of the sky on Tuesday and will continue on Wednesday.
In October, there may be large temperature fluctuations in the U.S. as the Arctic cools and the tropical regions remain quite warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic changes in temperatures over short distances.
Sunday is a great example of a dramatic temperature difference in the central part of the United States.
There is a 20 degree difference between Kanas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
In the next few days, summer temperatures will try to set and expand again.
Most of the central and eastern U.S. will enter a warm October with temperatures around 27°C from the Southern Plain region to parts of the northeast.
In New York, it could be 27°C on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows good chances of temperatures above average for the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have seen Brett Kavanaugh's interrogation.
More than 20 million people watched on six television networks Thursday's interesting testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman accused of sexual assault, which was supposed to occur in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political fallout continued as television stations cut off their regular program due to Friday’s last-minute upheaval: an agreement reached by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI would conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Justice Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh, in a guilty state, had tipped her off and tried to take her off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in a tumultuous testimony that he was 100 percent sure that this had not happened.
Nielsen reports that more than 20.4 million people are expected to see the testimony on Friday.
The company counted the average viewership of television networks CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available to other witness-playing networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some problems with the number of viewers watching the program in the offices.
For ease of performance, the audience is similar to that of playing a final football match or awarding an American Film Academy award.
The Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly support Kavanaugh’s appointment, is leading the day-to-day hearing in front of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers, reports Nielsen.
In second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS network had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers, reports Nielsen.
Interest remained high even after the hearing.
Flake had a central role in Friday's drama.
After the office of a moderate Republican made a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS television cameras on Friday morning filmed protesters yelling at him as he tried to get into the elevator to attend a hearing of the Justice Committee.
During the construction, he hung his eyes for a few minutes, which was captured live by the cameras of the TV house CNN.
“I’m standing right in front of you,” a woman said.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?
You have power, while many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office made a statement, and added that he would say more at the committee hearing, and then the doors of the elevator closed.
All television networks were broadcast live even hours later, when the Justice Committee voted to hand over Kavanaugh's appointment to a vote in the Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so if they agreed that the FBI would investigate charges against the candidate next week, as called for by the Democratic minority party.
Flake was partly convinced of this in conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several other senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's vote was decisive, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to appoint Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an investigation by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May Accuses Criticism of ‘Political Games’ on Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “playing political games” with the UK’s future and undermining the national interest.
The arrival of British Prime Minister Theresa May at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, in addition to the one with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson stepped up his attack on her so-called Chequers Brexit plan, saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU pay each other’s tariffs was “completely absurd.”
Shooting of Waydeo Sims: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson, Suspected of Death of LSU Player
Police have arrested a suspect in a fatal shooting at Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
According to police from Baron Rouge, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and taken to prison on charges of second-degree murder.
Officials released a video of a confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his sunglasses during the fight.
Police found sunglasses on the scene and on them Simpson's DNA, CBS television complements WAFB television reports.
After Simpson's interrogation, police made a statement that he confessed to shooting Wayde to death.
The bail is $350,000, the lawyer said.
A surveyor from East Baton Rouge Parish on Friday issued a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The police are thanking the Special Unit for Refugees of the Louisiana State Police, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the Police of the Southern University and the residents of the area for their help in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the local law enforcement authorities for their “care and search for justice”.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 201-centimeter striker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
Last season he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps per game.
On Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“That’s what you worry about all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano Brushes Ash in Mexico City
The ash, vomited by the Popocatepetl volcano, has reached the southern neighborhoods of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano as activity in the crater intensified and 183 gas and ash discharges were recorded in 24 hours.
The center observed several cases of thunderstorms and earthquakes.
Images on social media showed a thin layer of ash covering the windshields of cars in the neighborhoods of the capital, Mexico City, such as Xocchimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity in the volcano, which lies 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, after a 7.1-magnitude quake in September 2017 rocked central Mexico.
The volcano, dubbed "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of anniversary of independence vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after pro-independence protesters clashed with anti-Semitic police units and thousands joined rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarized vote to secede.
A group of masked supporters of separatism, detained by anti-elite police units, scrubbed them with eggs and metallic powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually flooded with tourists.
Later, there were also clashes, with the police having to use pendres to stop the fighting.
Proponents of independence, who for hours shouted “without forgetting, without forgiving,” faced protesters who supported unity and shouted “Long live Spain!”
According to local media reports, 14 people were more easily injured in the protests.
A year after the referendum on 1 October, which was declared illegal in Madrid and celebrated by Catalan separatists, tensions in the region that supports independence remain.
A large majority of voters voted for independence, although participation was low, as opponents of the secession largely boycotted the election.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the continuation of voting in polls in the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups camped in front of voters overnight to prevent demonstrations and support the state police.
The demonstrations continued, but they had to take a different path.
Narcissus Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he had no hope of Catalonia becoming independent.
“We had one of our best moments last year.
I watched my parents cry out of happiness because they could vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite important, although close victories in the regional elections last December, Catalan parties that support independence have struggled to maintain the initiative this year, as many of the most well-known leaders are in voluntary exile or are awaiting trial in detention for their role in organising referendums.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest with his phone in support of the police, explained that the protest was sparked by politicians on both sides.
“The tension is escalating,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, said he would run for the European Parliament next year.
“Candidates in the European elections are the best way to condemn the regression in democratic values and oppression that we have seen in the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Arrested men who drove a car into the house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested for repeatedly crashing into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred on Ballynagard Crescent Street on Thursday at around 7:30 p.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the door and the building itself were damaged.
At some point, they were also supposed to shoot at the car with a crossbow.
With Menga, Livingston won 1-0 against the Rangers.
Dolly Menga with her first goal for Livingston secured the win
Livingston stunned the Rangers and Steven Gerrard only had to concede his second defeat in 18 games as the club's coach from Ibrox.
The shot of Dolly Mengay made the difference, as Gary Holt's team equalized with Hibernian's team in second place.
Gerrard's team was thus left without a win in this year's championship, and next Sunday they will be waiting for the Hearts, who lead the ladder and who are behind by eight points.
The Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna team in the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has increased his innings in the division to six games and head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, has not yet experienced a defeat.
Livingston wasted his chances against direct guests
Holt's team should have led well before the hit, as they caused a number of problems with their directness to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to break through, but he sent the ball over the goal frame, then Alan Lithgow hit the goal, and Craig Halkett shot his head over the goal.
The hosts left the game to the Rangers, knowing that they could be dangerous to the guests when interrupted in the attack.
And that’s how they came to a key goal.
The Rangers gave Livingston a free kick, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson prepared an action for Mengaj, who shot and hit from the middle of the penitentiary.
The Rangers had a larger possession of the ball, but the home defenses could not break and goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not have much to do.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos extorted Kelly's defense.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor defended Scott Pittman's shot with his leg, and Lithgow shot past the goal from another Livingston break in the attack.
The submissions continued to arrive in Livingston’s penal space, but the domestics rejected all assaults, two offences – Halkett’s offense over Glenn Middleton’s replacement and a hand-playing offense – and the judge did not adjudicate.
Livingston's "Excellent Performance" - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont (BBC Scotland) at Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and result for Livingston.
All of them have been excellent and continue to exceed expectations on their way up.
The style of the game and the character have not changed much since their return to the top, but Holt should be credited for the way he has woken up the team since his arrival.
There were a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett played an extremely important role and had a well-arranged defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on standby all the time.
The Rangers simply lacked inspiration.
Although they are exceptional under the leadership of Gerrard, they are greatly lacking in these standards.
There was a lack of shots to the goal – only once they successfully defeated the hosts’ defense – and this is a sort of wake-up call for the Rangers, who were in the middle of the ladder.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an received a mixed vote in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin, smiles and blue skies prevailed.
Today is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
There have been disputes over human rights, press freedom and Turkey's approach to the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to open a grand new mosque.
The city is home to the largest number of the Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police prevented 25,000 heads from gathering in front of the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters managed to get closer to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters – many of them Kurds – also expressed their views and condemned Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him to the country.
The protests reflect the separation of the visitor, which some German Turks celebrate as a hero, while others despise as an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist fatally injured in car crash
In London, a cyclist was fatally injured in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on a road in Deptford in the southeast of the city at around 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and rescuers came, but the man died at the end of the accident.
The accident occurred just months after the cyclist died in a collision in which the driver of the car escaped, on Childers Street, about 1.5 km from Saturday's crash.
Police said police are checking the man's identity to let his family know.
They set up roadblocks and redirected bus lines, and advised motorists to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Jail: Six guards injured in crash
Six prison guards were injured in an explosion at a tightly guarded male prison, the prison administration said.
The disorder erupted at HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at around 9.30am British summer time and is still ongoing.
Police specialists from the Tornado unit were called in to arrange an incident involving eight inmates and limited to one wing.
The guards were provided with minor injuries to the face on the spot.
A prison staff representative said: “We have called specially trained staff to take care of the exit at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were injured in the accident.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the police will be responsible for this and may be behind bars even longer.”
There are more than 500 prisoners in HMP Long Lartin prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager was in hospital care because he was attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, they called in the jail an anti-discrimination police unit to intervene in a serious incident in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (which may be beneficial for drylands)
The tropical depression rarely reaches Arizona, but this is likely to happen early next week as the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa clears its way through the southwestern desert and brings the danger of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of sudden flooding on Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to rage over Phoenix on Tuesday and will approach late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of a tropical storm or depression within 300 kilometers of Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) raged a good 60 kilometers from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 50 to 100 mm of rainfall with individual rainfalls of up to 150 mm at Mogollon Rome, Arizona.
In other areas of the southwestern desert, including the Rockies and Great Basin areas, 25 to 50 mm of precipitation is expected, individual precipitations of up to 100 mm are possible.
For areas outside the danger of sudden flooding, the rain of Hurricane Rosa may be a real blessing, as the region has been affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of the rainfall is likely to be beneficial, as the southwest is currently experiencing a dry period.
“According to the U.S. sushi tracking center, a good 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing the least extreme drought,” reports weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa's path leads to the mainland of Mexico's Baja California Peninsula.
Rosa, which still has the strength of a hurricane on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 137 kilometers per hour, is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenie in Mexico and is moving north at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm comes into contact with colder waters in the Pacific and therefore weakens.
It is expected that the mainland of Mexico will be reached by the power of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rainfall in parts of Mexico can be plentiful and therefore pose a great risk of flooding.
“From the Baja California Peninsula to the northwest of Sonora, we expect 75 to 150 mm of precipitation with a possibility of 250 mm of precipitation,” the report said.
Hurricane Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours on Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then travel through Arizona and toward southern Utah until late night on Tuesday.
“The greatest danger we expect from Hurricane Rosa or its remnants is heavy rain on the Baja Califonia Peninsula in northwest Sonora and in the American southwestern desert,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These precipitations can cause life-threatening sudden floods and floods in deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after finding a 16-year-old man with puncture wounds in Somerset.
The injured teenager was found in the Excelsion Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at around 4:00 a.m.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition remains “stable”.
The 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested at night in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police reported.
Police are urging anyone who may have been caught using a mobile phone to respond.
Trump says Kavanaugh “suffered unkindness and anger” from Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthlessness and reckless tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a convention in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the unkindness and anger" of the Democratic Party in the process of his appointment.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, clearly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford’s accusations that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
At the hearing, Ford also testified about his accusations.
The president said on Saturday that the day "Americans saw Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality, and courage."
“The vote to nominate Judge Kavanaugh is the vote to nominate one of the best legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an outstanding record of public service,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly mentioned Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“Five more weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
“I’m really trying to run,” he said.
That’s why I’m fighting everywhere for great candidates.”
Trump says Democrats are on a mission of “stopping and obstructing.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place no later than Friday, a Republican adviser told CNN.
Hundreds Killed in Indonesian Earthquake and Tsunami, Death toll Rises
Authorities said on Saturday that at least 384 people had died in the earthquake and tsunami that hit Indonesia's Sulawesi island, many of whom were carried by giant waves that swept the coast.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in Palu on Friday, when six-metre waves struck the coast in the dark, killing many and destroying everyone on their way.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people stayed on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they became victims,” BNPB spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a meeting in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it dragged cars, trees, houses, it all fell to the ground,” Nugroho explained, adding that the tsunami traveled across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the shore.
He said that some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami, and they survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photos released by the accident agency show destroyed buildings and shops, rolled-up and demolished bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
In an area of 2.4 million people, a series of earthquakes were felt.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Use Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released in Friday’s powerful earthquake was about 200 times the power of the Hiroshima atomic bomb in World War II.
The geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long and narrow bay, is expected to increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as “extensive” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He also said that the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the ruins of the buildings, and added that 540 people were injured and 29 are still missing.
Nugroho explained that the casualties and damage may be greater off the coast 300 km north of Palu, in the area of Donggala, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
As Nugroho has said, communications are completely interrupted and have no information from the Donggala area.
“There are more than 300,000 people living in the area,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers are going to the affected areas.
“It’s a tragedy, but it can get worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the agency received a lot of criticism as it did not notify the public that the tsunami had affected Pal, but officials say the waves came just at the time of the warning.
In an amateur video posted on social media, a man on the top floor screams warning people on the street about the approaching tsunami.
Within a few minutes, the water wall crashed along the coast and took the buildings and cars with it.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
Authorities say the military has started sending cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees are still in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport was opened only to provide assistance and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to more than 800.
It's very bad.
According to Mr. Dosebe, members of the World Vision organization from Donggale arrived safely in Palu, where employees in the courtyard in front of their premises set up a shelter from the arcades, but on the way they saw many scenes of devastation.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups launched disaster relief initiatives, some complained that foreign humanitarian workers with extensive experience were not allowed to enter Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, overseas financing, supplies and assistance to staff are only allowed if the place of the accident is declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It is still considered a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says, ‘Okay, this is a national disaster,’ we can accept international aid, but there is no such status yet.”
On the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami in Palau, friends and relatives of the missing persons hope that their near-miracles are in the sad stories of natural disasters.
A boy was pulled out of the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days, with her mother's body lying next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national parachuting team, trained two missing parachuting paratroopers for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
The others, trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, according to Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“As an elder in the field of paragliding, I carry my emotional burden,” he said.
Mr Gendon recalls how, in the hours when news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel circulated through the community of sailors, in despair he sent messages in the WhatsApp app to competitors in Palu who attended the festival on the beach.
But his messages were marked with only one gray tick instead of two blue ones.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 while loading ATMs in Newport on the Levee
According to Newport police, the robbers stole $26,750 from a Brink’s security worker who loaded an ATM in downtown Newport on the Leeve on Friday morning.
The driver of the car emptied an ATM in an entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver the money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While employed, another man “approached Brink’s security guard from behind” and stole a bag of delivery money.
Witnesses were reported to have seen several suspects fleeing from the scene, but police did not specify the exact number of those involved.
Anyone with information about the identity of the suspects should call the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
The amendment was tweeted on Saturday, writing: “Being officially named Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has also used it to title his eighth album, which he released in June.
The change comes just before his performance on Saturday Night Live, in which he is supposed to present his new album Yandhi.
He will replace singer Ariano grande, who canceled the show for “personal reasons,” the show’s creator said.
The word is an abbreviation of his current professional name, but West has already said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible where it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year when he spoke to Big Boy about the album’s title.
“So I am you and I am all of me.
Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, I changed to Ye – it reflects our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is a reflection of everything we are.”
Kanye is one of many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was named Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, and this year he expressed a desire for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West associate, JAY-Z, also used his name differently; with or without thought and in capital letters.
Mexico's President AMLO vows not to use military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andress Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody student violence.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use the military to suppress the Mexican people.”
At a time when left-wing student movements began to operate in Latin America, soldiers began shooting and killing 300 people at peaceful demonstrations in the square on October 2, 1968.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to support young Mexicans and provide students with monthly grants and open several free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of opportunities for education are dragging young people into criminal associations.
U.S. Should Double Artificial Intelligence Funding
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the funds it spends on research in the field, says investor and artificial intelligence expert Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government announced the use of artificial intelligence, although the U.S. has no official artificial intelligence strategy at all.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: their goal is to become the best in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for artificial intelligence research would be a good start, given that all other countries are pretty much for the US and we’re looking for the next breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence,” Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the chances of the next big breakthrough in artificial intelligence happening in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” (Supersile Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order) was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the president of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of Kita’s most prominent companies.
In the 1980s, he developed an artificial intelligence system at Carnegie Mellon University that defeated the top-ranked American Othello player, and later served as the CEO of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee said he was familiar with previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) robotics competition, and asked when the next one would be easier to find next visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. need to work hard if they want to receive state support, Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes the best academics, it’s companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have recruited the best from universities to develop artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes to immigration policy could help the U.S. step up efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think people with a PhD in artificial intelligence should automatically be offered a green card,” he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China issued a development plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence.
China’s National Science Foundation funds people in academic institutions, similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distributing money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is poorer in China, Lee explained.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which brings together partners from the industrial and academic sectors, and the White House announced the establishment of a tighter Artificial Intelligence Committee.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in AI Next.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) is currently investing more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that wanted to create the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has done nothing for months.
The Macedonians will decide on the change of the name of the country in the referendum
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum on Sunday to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia" to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has opposed their application for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern neighbours represents the right to their territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the governments reached an agreement based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will destroy the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonians.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, but the boycott campaign expressed doubts that participation would be at least 50 percent, as long as the referendum is valid.
The question on the referendum ballot was: “Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership by accepting an agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is a price worth paying to join bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia.
Today I came to vote for the future of the country and for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough MEPs have said they will respect the outcome of the vote, which will be decisive.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The National Election Commission said that no irregularities had been reported until 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their votes.
“I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter from the capital of Skopje.
On 30 September 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Du<0xC5><0xA1>ko handed over their ballot papers for a referendum in Macedonia on changing the name of the country, which would pave the way for NATO and European Union accession.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and set up chairs in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I believe that a large majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after the release of his ballot.
He added that the positive outcome would be “a confirmation of our future.”
A poll published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research on Monday showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would vote in the referendum, which is less than the required turnout.
A second poll conducted by Macedonian television Telma showed that 57% of respondents would vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them would vote for it.
In order for the referendum to succeed, the turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
A failed referendum would mean the first major blow to the pro-Western government's policy, which took office last May.
Sergio Aguero of Manchester City has overtaken all of Brighton's defenses and hit
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling played Brighton's defence at Etihad Stadium in Manchester on Saturday for Manchester City's 2-0 win.
Aguero's hit in the 65th minute looked ridiculously easy.
At the start of the action, the Argentinian striker accepted a serving in the middle of the field.
He ran among Brighton's three defensive players and found an open space.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green players.
He overcame one defensive player and was faster than the others on the edge of Brighton's penal space.
Then he handed Sterling to his left.
With his first touch in the penalty area, the English striker returned the ball to Aguero, who beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with his right foot and sent the ball to the right side of the net.
“Aguero is struggling with his legs,” City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We agreed that he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
“We were lucky to have scored a goal at the time.”
But Sterling was the one who gave the blues the initial advantage in the first English league duel.
He scored in the 29th minute.
In this action, Aguero took the ball deep in the Brighton half.
The ball on the left was nicely handed to Leroy Sane.
Dreams touched the ball a few times, then sent the ball to Sterling towards the distant goalkeeper.
The blue-blue striker kicked the ball into the net just before it flew past the goal.
City will meet Hoffenheim at 12.55 pm at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany, in the group stage of the Champions League.
Scherzer wants to play against the Rockies and spoil their chances for the title
The Nationals team dropped out of the finale, so there's no particular reason for a new attack.
But always competitive Scherzer hopes to be able to climb the metal hill against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday. This will only happen if the Rockies still have the chance to play in the final, as they have an advantage in the Western League game over the Los Angeles Dodgers.
The Rockies secured the organizer’s least invitation on Friday with a 5:2 win over the Nationals, but are still awaiting their first division title.
“Although we can’t get anything, we will at least be able to play in a great atmosphere in front of a large crowd here in Denver and the opposing team will play at probably the highest level this year.
“Why don’t you want to compete?”
The Nationals have not yet announced the name of the first metaller for Sunday, but it's likely to be Scherzer metal in this case.
Scherzer, who will become the first metal player for the 34th time, is a metal player on Thursday and would have had enough days of rest by Sunday.
The Washington right-hander collected 18 wins and 7 losses this season with an average of 2.53 runs and 300 knockouts with 220 2/3 shifts this season.
Trump at a Congress in West Virginia
The president indirectly touched on the situation regarding his election to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done will be at stake in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
This will be one of the biggest – I’m really trying to run, so I’m fighting everywhere for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “We have this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats and it’s happening right now.
They are determined to retake power, using all possible means. You can see dishonesty, malice.
They don’t care who they are hurting, who they have to drag to get power and control, because that’s what they want, power and control, but that’s not what we’re going to give them.”
According to him, the Democrats are on a mission of “stopping and obstructing.”
“And you could see that in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “greedy, mean, lowly and false.”
He named a member of the Justice Committee, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, and there was loud disapproval from the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um, no, I didn't, wait. That was really bad body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer open to different views.
Those who express their opinions are impatient.
When a Momentum activist in my local party spoke out against me, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last member of Parliament from the Labour Party who is not welcome for expressing his opinion.
My fellow MEP, Joan Ryan, did the same because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, it was a motion of no confidence for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour Party said in a statement Friday that it “wants meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
In eight years, as far as I am a member of the parliament of the local Labour Party, Friday's meetings were mostly exactly like that.
Unfortunately, such a tone is not used at most meetings today, and the promise of a “kinder and gentler” policy has long been forgotten if it ever began.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different views within the Labour Party are not admissible and each opinion is assessed as to whether this is acceptable to the leadership of the Party.
This started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, and my colleagues, who I thought we shared similar political views earlier, expected me to change my mind and take positions that I would otherwise never agree with – be it in the area of national security or the EU's single market.
When I speak in public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – there are criticisms on social networks that call for non-choice, condemn the politics of the middle and tell me I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments intended for me are only political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist insults on a daily basis, but are not afraid.
One of the most deplorable aspects of this period of politics is how abuse rates have become quite commonplace.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party must promote a culture of tolerance.
But the reality is that we are no longer open to different opinions and with each proposal of distrust or change of the rules for the choice of the client becomes more skewed.
Over the past two years, I’ve received a lot of advice to keep my head down and not be so loud, and I’m going to be “all right.”
But I didn't get into politics because of that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student – the reason for this was the negligence of the Tatcher government, which literally caused the classroom in my elementary school to collapse – I have tried to advocate for better public services for those in need as a local saint or government minister.
I have never concealed my political beliefs, including the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East party could be confused by my political views and areas of which I did not agree with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I just want to say that I do not understand their desire to waste time and energy discussing my allegiance to the leader of the Labour Party at a time when the country is heading towards Brexit, which will hurt households, businesses and our public services.
But my real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents and voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise you that no threat of indiscriminate or political aptitude will deter me from acting in the best interest of all.
Chris Leslie is a member of parliament from Nottingham East.
Ayr 38:17 Melrose: invincible Ayr at the top of the scale
Two known attempts have somewhat distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this wonderfully entertaining championship game of the day.
They are now at the top of the rankings and are the only undefeated team out of ten.
In the end, the scales were swept to the home side by their top defense and better taking advantage of the opportunity, and coach Peter Murchie had good reason to be pleased.
“We have passed a lot of tests in our games so far and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “Congratulations to the Ayra team, they took advantage of the opportunities better than we did.”
Grant Anderson's 14-minute hit by Frazier Climo led Ayr to the lead, but the yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, which he received in the game with the Warriors, meant numerical superiority for Melrose and Jason Baggott stopped the attempt without conversion.
Climo increased the lead for Ayr at the time of the breach, before hitting at halftime and then turning the stand-alone attempt into a 17:5 score for Ayr at break.
But Melrose started the second half very well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was converted by Baggot, reduced the backlog to five points.
There was a long hiatus due to the serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried on the stretcher, and Ayr continued to advance with Stafford McDowall's attempt, which was converted by Climo.
Interim captain Ayra Blair MacPherspon then received a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of the game with the player more with the unconverted attempt of Bruce Colvine at the end of the period of intense pressure.
But the hosts came back and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for obstructing the ballless climate, MacPherson hit the attack.
Climo reached points after Kyle Rowe stopped shooting David Armstrong and sent wing player Gregor Henry in the fifth attempt of the hosts.
Still Game Star Begins New Career in Hospitality
Still-Game series star Ford Kieran is apparently entering the catering industry as he is expected to become the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old in the popular BBC series, for which he also wrote the script, plays Jack Jarvis along with his longtime comedian partner, Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that after the next ninth season, the last, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning life after Craiglang.
According to official documentation, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the story, but the source suggested to Scottish Sun that Kiernan wanted to get involved in "flowering hospitality" in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes that the court will once again open the way to the Pacific
Marines patrolling the navy headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings, naval blue flags are hung.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are covered with the slogan: “We have a right to the sea.
It is our duty to get it back.”
In mainland Bolivia, the memory of the loss of the coast in a bloody conflict over natural resources with Chile in the 19th century is still alive – as is the longing for a re-float in the Pacific Ocean.
This hope is perhaps the greatest now after decades, as Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice, which will be received after five years of consultations on October 1.
“Bolivia has a drive, a spirit of unity and impartiality and, of course, in a positive spirit, expects a result,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the International Court of Justice’s decision on large screens across the country and hope that the Hague court will decide in favor of Bolivia, which claims that, after decades of volatile talks, Chile must negotiate Bolivia’s access to sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic native president, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has high expectations for Monday’s verdict.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will not decide in favor of Bolivia – and even if it did, it would not change much.
A UN body based in the Netherlands has no authority to allocate Chilean territory to Bolivia, and will not decide on the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice’s decision comes only six months after the final arguments were heard means that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And for the last four years, they haven't spoken in favor of Bolivia, but they may have cost it a lot.
“The current Bolivian government has taken advantage of the issue of access to the sea,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rateeva said.
Morales’s aggressive rhetoric snatched all the goodwill that might have remained from the Chileans, she explained.
The talks between Bolivia and Chile will continue at some point, but after that it will be extremely difficult to participate in the discussions.
The country has not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, the Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court had unusually quickly taken a decision.
On Monday, it will bring Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity for a new era of relations with Chile” and the opportunity to “end 139 years of mutually beneficial disagreements,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – had used the maritime question as political support.
“Bolivia will never renounce its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“Decision is an opportunity to see that we must overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won’t happen if it can’t trust the U.S.
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his people would never be the first to destroy their nuclear weapons if they can’t trust Washington.
Ri delivered a speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on its promises made at a meeting of rival heads of state in Singapore.
His statement comes at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is clearly on the verge of restarting nuclear diplomacy, which has been at a dead end, more than three months after a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says the U.S. is wrong to think that the continuation of sanctions and opposition to the announcement of the end of the Korean War will bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is cautious in enforcing the forecast without Pyongyang first taking decisive action to disarm.
Kim and US President Donald Trump are looking forward to a second meeting.
But there is general doubt that Pyongyang is serious about the ceasefire, which the country sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare everything for Kim and Trump’s second meeting.
At fashion shows in Paris unveiled the latest line of huge covers coming to stores with affordable brands near you
If you want to complement your collection of covers or completely hide from the sun, you do not need to look ahead.
Designer Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a collection of bizarre oversized covers in their spring and summer 2019 collections on the fashion lane that blinded the style of Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical covers flooded Instagram this summer, and the designers sent their spectacular creations to the fashion scene.
Valentine's piece that stood out the most was a beige hat with wide laces decorated with feather-like accessories, in which the heads of the models were completely lost.
Other oversized fashion accessories included watermelons with precious stones, a magic hat, and even pineapple – but your heads won’t warm up.
Thom Browne has also shown a selection of bizarre masks – just the right time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks have sewn lips and are more similar to Hannibal Lecter masks than high fashion.
One creation was similar to diving equipment with a breather and glasses, and the other was like a cornet with melted ice cream.
And if you want to follow fashion, you are in luck.
Fashion connoisseurs predict that giant covers will come to stores near you.
The wide hats closely follow “La Bombi”, a straw hat with 60-centimeter tips was noticed by Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski, among others.
The cult brand of extremely impractical hats, which has flooded social networks, has sent another great creation along the fashion trail – a straw bag for the beach, which was almost as big as the model in the swimsuits she was wearing.
The raffia bag in a burnt orange color, trimmed with raffia beads and with a white leather handle, was the central piece of the La Riviera collection by designer Jacquemus for spring/summer 2019 at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect big beach hats and bags to arrive in stores next summer – because the designer has made such a strong impression, the demand for oversized accessories would be hard to ignore.”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is crucial for global citizens
Scottish independent schools enjoy a reputation for academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another series of outstanding results on exams, further enhanced by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other community endeavors.
With more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest level of service to their pupils and their parents.
Independent schools want to prepare their students for further and higher education, the chosen career path and the place they have as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailor-made school curriculum, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable elective subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to a person in a language he understands, the conversation will impress him in his memory.
But if you speak to a man in his mother tongue, words are imprinted on his heart.”
This is a good reminder that we should not rely solely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s results of recent exams show that languages are at the top of the scale with the highest levels of achievement in independent schools.
Sixty-eight percent of students who learned a foreign language achieved an excellent grade.
Data collected in 74 member schools of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS) showed that 72% of pupils achieved an excellent score in Mandarin, while 72% of German pupils, 69% of French pupils and 63% of French pupils also received an excellent score.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are treated as an elective subject in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere in the same way as subjects in the fields of natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics.
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Training Commission in 2014 showed that 17% of the reasons why employers struggle to fill vacancies can be attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, knowledge of languages is becoming increasingly necessary in preparing young people for their future career path.
In future job opportunities that require language proficiency, these skills are essential in a global world.
If someone learns another language, regardless of the career path he chooses, with such lifelong knowledge, he has a great advantage in the future.
A multilingual person who can communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically has an advantage over the competition.
A 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK showed that 75 percent of people did not speak a foreign language well enough to be able to speak, with French being the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage of respondents, which is 15 percent.
Therefore, investing in language learning is important for today’s children.
With the knowledge of several languages, especially those from developing countries, children have a better chance of finding a suitable job.
In Scotland, schools differ in the languages they teach.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are expected to be the most important for the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of your child, it will always be possible to choose a number of languages taught by experts in this field in independent schools.
Scottish Independent Schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare and equip children with the knowledge they need to succeed, no matter what the future brings.
In the global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages remain extremely important for the future of the country, so this must also be expressed in education.
In fact, modern languages should be regarded as “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
You have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron to debut in Lakers jersey at San Diego on Sunday
For fans looking forward to LeBron James’ first appearance for the Los Angeles Lakers, the wait will soon be over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's inaugural game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
He doesn’t know how many minutes he will play.
“More than one and less than 48,” Walton explained on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said on Twitter that James is likely to play for a few minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers games ahead of the season.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need a pre-season game to prepare,” he said.
Trump's Congress in West Virginia on YouTube
President Donald Trump is starting a series of congresses in his campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump’s five planned conventions next week, including stops in favored states including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With his candidate for a vacancy in the Supreme Court not yet confirmed, Trump wants to gain support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans face a loss of control of Congress following a November vote.
What time will Trump’s convention be in West Virginia, and where will it be possible to watch it online?
Trump’s convention in Wheeling, West Virginia, will be held on Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7:00 p.m.
You can watch Trump’s congress in West Virginia live online on the YouTube channel.
Trump is likely to talk about the hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh this week, which have become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct, prompting confirmation in the Senate expected to be delayed by a week for the FBI to conduct an investigation.
But the primary goal of this series of congresses is to help Republicans awaiting important elections in November gain fresh momentum.
That’s why in President Trump’s campaign, these five congresses were intended “to encourage volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and increase the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives.
“Congressional oversight is so important to his program that the president will travel to as many countries as possible during the grueling campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Today’s convention at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could also be attended by supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, according to West Virginia MetroNews, which would attract interest from the Pittsburgh media.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in a month, where he scored more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey from West Virginia, who is lagging behind in opinion polls.
“For Morrisey, it’s a bad sign that the president has to come and ‘raise’ him in public opinion polls,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team still has a desire to win and maintains hope ahead of Sunday's individual duels
After three one-sided games, maybe the Saturday afternoon foursomes were what the Ryder Cup needed this year.
A swing swing is a completely fictional sports concept, but players really believe in it, especially in such competitions.
So where is the swing going now?
“They had six points, but now they have four, so it’s probably a new start for us,” Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe has an advantage, of course, because it leads by four points, and another twelve can get them.
But the Americans, according to Spiet, feel that they have the wind in their sails, in addition to being stimulated by the form of Spietho and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each won three points out of four.
Spieth was fatal from the initial blow to the green and sets a good example.
The screams of happiness continued to grow louder and led to a decisive blow when they equalized with Thomas after a two-point delay in the fourth game.
The strike that brought them victory at the 15th hole was accompanied by a similar scream, one that lets you know that he believes the American team still has a chance.
“You just have to find your inner strength and focus on your game,” Spieth said.
That's all that's left for these players now.
18 holes to glory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas have in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
The unusual but charming two of Europe have won four points out of four and they are unmissable.
The two Molliwoods were the only ones who did not hit the bugs on Saturday afternoon, and the bugs were also avoided on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and at the last nine holes on Friday morning.
Such a game and the way in which the energy is apparently flowing between them and the noisy crowd, confirm the fact that they are the players that will have to be defeated on Sunday, and no other player could have better sealed the possible victories of Europe than Fleetwood or Le Molinari when the sun is shining on the Nationals.
Or maybe both at the same time in different places.
But talking about European glory would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of the four-ball game, who was paired with Alex Noren.
Due to bugs and two double bugs in the first nine holes, the Spaniard and Sweden fell into a crisis from which they could not find a way out.
Players will not be able to help on Saturday.
Four-ball games and two-double duels are exceptionally interesting to watch closely because of the communication between the pairs, the advice they give themselves, the advice they don’t give themselves, and the way in which the strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has so far played better than the team and has a lot of advantage over the last day, but the duels of the two have shown that the U.S. team too has a desire to win, which some, especially on the American side, have doubted.
Europe leads 10:6 ahead of last day of Ryder Cup
Europe is going on the last day of the Ryder Cup with a nice advantage after leading with 10:6 against the USA after Saturday's four-ball games and two-two duels.
The excellent pair, made up of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, gave their best and, with two wins over Tiger Woods and Le Golf National, scored four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who strives to win the trophy she lost two years ago in Hazeltine, had a four-ball lead in the morning games over the American team that made a mistake and led in the series with 3:1.
The U.S. team resisted better in the duels of the two, where they won two games, but could not make up for the delay.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 individual duels to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four consecutive points, while with Molinari (the pair were dubbed "Molliwood"), after a sensational weekend, only the second pair to win four points in their first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After winning against Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they then proved themselves again and even more convincingly defeated the worn-out Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with 5 and 4.
Woods, who dragged through two games on Saturday, showed his brilliance for a moment, but lost 19 of 29 games in four-ball duels and two-double duels, seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose, who was resting for the morning four-ball game, returned for the duels of the two and in pairs with Henrik Stenson with 2 and 1 defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koeopko, who were ranked first and third in the world rankings.
But on a pleasant, windy day in the southwestern part of Paris, not everything went according to the plans of the team of Europe.
Three-time winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a new benchmark for Americans with two points on Saturday.
With 2 and 1 they decisively beat the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a four-ball game and later returned and defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4 and 3 in the duels of the two pairs, losing the first two holes.
Only once in Ryder's history, the team has returned after a four-point delay before individual duels, although Fury's team only needs an equalizer to maintain the trophy.
But after two days in a different place, a Sunday counterattack may seem too much for her.
North Korea: “Without confidence, we will not unilaterally disarm”
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued implementation of sanctions is causing growing distrust in the United States and that North Korea will certainly not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such conditions.
Ri Jong Ho said at the annual meeting of the General Assembly of this world body that North Korea has taken a number of “important measures in the name of goodwill” over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile experiments, undermining the city’s nuclear-defense capabilities, and making no promises.
“However, we do not see an adequate response from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, we will not be confident in national security and under such conditions, we will not unilaterally disarm first.”
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s resistance to a gradual approach to nuclear disarmament, in which North Korea would be rewarded for taking progressive action, his statement was important because it did not immediately reject the move.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump from the first summit between the current U.S. president and the North Korean leader, held on June 12 in Singapore. At that time, Kim pledged to strive for “nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula”, while Trump is safe for North Korea.
North Korea wants an official end to the Korean War that took place between 1950 and 1953, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington has also not backed down on calls to release the stringent international sanctions that apply to North Korea.
“The United States insists that we must disarm nuclear weapons first, and escalates pressure with sanctions to achieve its goals by coercion, and even opposes the declaration of the end of the war,” Ri said.
“The thought that sanctions could bring us to our knees is an unrealistic hope for people who don’t know us at all.
The problem is that the continued implementation of sanctions further deepens our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US president outlined at the United Nations Assembly earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in that have taken place over the past five months, adding: “If the problem of nuclear disarmament were discussed with South Korea and not the US, such a nuclear disarmament would be a dead end for the Korean Peninsula.”
However, the tone of the speech was completely different from last year’s when he told the United Nations General Assembly that an attack on the U.S. mainland with North Korean missiles was unavoidable after “Mr. President” Trump branded Kim as a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who last year threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim and his courage in taking disarmament measures at the United Nations Assembly, but said he still has a lot of work to do and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea breaks up.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no time frame for that, saying, “It could take two years, three years, or five months — it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia are of the opinion that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The imposition of Security Council sanctions must be resolutely continued without exception until we recognize the complete, final, and verified state of nuclear disarmament.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously adopted additional sanctions against North Korea to prevent the financing of North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Riyadh on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not end well.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said progress had been made, and North Korea had criticized him for several hours as saying his demands were "gangster".
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon this month to demolish the missile test station and nuclear test infrastructure if the United States takes “appropriate action.”
Mr. Munu said “appropriate measures” meant the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and measures to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard University students attend a course where they learn how to take enough time to rest
The goal of this year’s new course at Harvard University is to teach all undergraduate students how to afford more sleep. With such a course, they want to fight against the growing masculine culture of “full-time” learning, in which they gain strength with caffeine.
A university professor has found that students of the world’s best universities often do not know the basics of caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Women's Hospital, designed the course, which is the first of its kind in the United States.
To carry out such a course, he decided after his lecture on the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
At the end of the lecture, a girl approached him and said, “Why am I only learning this now that I’m in my senior year?”
She said no one had told her how important sleep was, and the professor told The Daily Telegraph that he was surprised.
The course, which is being conducted for the first time this year, talks about the key importance of good sleep habits for study and sports success as well as for improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the University’s executive director of health services, says that they opted for such a course when they found out that a student had a significant lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section is a picture of a student’s home door, where students can click coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes, and books to get information about the impact of caffeine and light, the impact of lack of sleep on sports success, and the importance of a sleep routine.
In the second section, participants learn that long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart failure, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The map of the student settlement with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We are aware that the behaviour of the students will not change immediately.
But we believe they have the right to be aware of these facts, just as they have the right to know how smoking affects their health,” adds Professor Czeisler.
The professor says that the culture of pride with “surviving full-time learning” is still present. He also adds that modern technology and the growing pressure on students, resulting in a lack of sleep, are a growing problem.
Professor Czeisler says that a sufficient amount of quality sleep should be the students' "secret weapon" to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety. Thus, they can also avoid gaining weight – the brain due to lack of sleep turns into a mode of hunger, which makes students lazy.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course. Last year, during his first year at Harvard, he attended a lecture by one of the professors.
He says that the lecture opened his eyes and encouraged him to carry out the course throughout the student settlement.
It hopes that in the next phase, postgraduate students will be able to request to complete a similar study program before enrolling in a competition institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends students to set an alarm clock for sleeping as well as waking up. He also wants to alert them to the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, as they can cause an imbalance of circadian rhythm, making it difficult to
Livingston : Rangers <0x3D> 1 : 0 Menga with seeded sunk up Gerrard's team
The Rangers again defeated in the guests: Dolly Menga in Livingston declared team Steven Gerrard condemned to a 1-0 defeat.
The Ibrox team chased their first guest win after a 4–1 win at St. Johnstone Stadium in February, but Gary Holt's team beat them for the second time in 18 games since head coaching Gerrard, leaving his team for the leading Scottish League team behind 8 points.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the selected Rangers did not give the impression that he wanted to equalize.
With this, the Rangers fell to frequent place, and Livingston advanced to third place, but with the difference of goals, the Hibernian team lagged behind.
Calum Spence, a side referee, suffered a head injury when an object was reported to have flown in from the city of the fans' visiting team.
Gerrard, who easily defeated Ayr in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup, made eight changes.
On the other hand, Holt was sticking with the verified Livingston elf, who had taken the Hearts point a week earlier, and was undoubtedly excited about how his escaping team effectively neutralized all of the guest experiments.
The Rangers had a higher possession of the ball, but Livingston made better use of it.
The first opportunity came just two minutes after the start, when Menga with the first brief serve found Scott Pittman, who then set off on Allan McGregor's goal, but the spectator in the performance was inaccurate and missed the opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs' long free kick was then scored by Captain Craig Halkett, but the balls then his defensive assistant Alan Lithgow failed to score.
In the last third, the Rangers took control, but the game showed more hope than an actual desire to win.
Alfredo Morelos was quite sure that a penalty shot would have to be dull after a race with Steven Lawless after 15 minutes of the game, but Judge Steven Thomson crushed the Colombian's demands in the mud.
The Rangers managed to score only two shots per goal in the first half, but neither the head shot sent by Lassan Coulibaly against the goal nor Ovie Ejari's batting ball posed any danger to goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
Livingston’s opening goal in the 34th minute may have surprised everyone, but he was already well deserved for his perseverance.
The Rangers failed to monetize another Jacobs with a long run.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher brought the ball to Scott Robinson, who routinely prepared Mengi's hand for an easy end to the attack.
Gerrard took action and during the break replaced Coulibaly with winger Ryan Kent, who immediately proved to be giving Morelos, but Kelly effectively escaped from his lines and blocked the attack.
However, Livingstone continued in his style and forced guests into his game, with Lithgow and Halkett taking care of more servings in front of the goal.
Holt's team could have increased the lead by the end of the game, but McGregor effectively neutralized Jacobs, and then Lithgow was inaccurate after giving the corner.
At the Rangers, Glenn Middleton was given the opportunity to score a penalty shot at the end of the game after contact with Jacobs, but was not acknowledged by Judge Thomson.
Almanah: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
We present a page from the almanac of our Sunday editions: on September 30, 1882, that is, on the present day more than 136 years ago, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, who later became a world-famous physicist, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, this invention was the basis for the development of a device called the Geiger counter.
This became a constant in the scientific world, and he also got his place in pop culture, say in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans play a cowboy scientist:
Man: “What the hell is that?”
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter. It's used to look for radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put on your headphones, you can hear the effect of radioactivity in materials on atoms.”
Evans: “Madonca, now they’re really talking!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
The invention with his name lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Your Immune System to Recognize Attacking Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Your Immune System to Identify Attacking Cells and Destroy Them
Vaccine as part of therapy teaches the immune system to recognize attacking cells
This method involves obtaining the patient's immune cells, which are then changed in the laboratory
After that, they can “see” a protein that is characteristic of many forms of cancer, then they are returned to the patient
The results of the test vaccine are very encouraging in patients with very different cancers.
In one of the women who received the vaccine, which the immune system learns to recognize attacking cells, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
This method involves obtaining the patient’s immune cells, which they change in the laboratory to be able to “see” the HER2 protein, which is characteristic of many forms of cancer, and then re-inject.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Research Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “promotes the growth of several different cancers,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancers.
A similar approach to obtaining immune cells from patients who are “teached” to target cancer cells has also worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West made a pro-Trump point after his appearance at the SNL with the inscription MAGA on the drop.
The audience was not thrilled.
Kanye West was whistled at Saturday Night Live’s studio after a strange point during which he expressed support for U.S. President Donald Trump, and also said he would run for the presidency in 2020.
At the end of his performance with his third song, "Ghost Town", in which he wore a hat with the inscription "Make America Great Again", West launched an attack on the Democrats and once again expressed his support for Trump.
“It often happens that I talk to a white man and he says, ‘How can you like Trump because he’s racist?’
“Well, if I was worried about racism, I should have left America a long time ago,” he says.
The SNL show began with a parody of Matt Damon, in which a Hollywood actor dived from Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Commission, accused of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
The recording of West's monologue was not played, but was uploaded to social networks by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not known if Rock was going to make fun of West with that.
West also complained to the audience, among other things, that he had some trouble with the spelling.
“They came to me on stage.
They told me, ‘Don’t walk on that hood.’
I've been bullied!
But they say I’m lost,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “You want to see a lost scene?” and added that he had to put on “Superman’s cloak, because that means no one can tell me. You want the world to move on?
“Try it with love.”
His comments prepared the audience for the whistle at least twice, and members of the SNL team were obviously embarrassed, and someone told Vanity: “There was a deadly silence in the studio.”
West was asked at the last minute to trade a goat for Ariano Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West had already caused a lot of amazement with the video for the song "I Love It", where he wore a Perrier bottle of mineral water costume.
Westa was backed by Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: “One of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR GETTING RAJI.”
Talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is simply “what it is, and that’s just fine.
However, I will NOT reward anyone (by buying his music, clothing, or by supporting his “art”) who, in my opinion, welcomes and spreads an ideology that is harmful to our community.
He's free.
We too,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and would henceforth be “a creature formally known as Kanye West. Now I am YE.”
He is not the first musician to change his name, as did Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague Snoop Dogg was once called Snoop Lion, but we cannot forget another musical legend: Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then he was the Artist, once known as Prince.
Man charged with attempted murder for stabbing a person in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
Police say the incident happened in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is due to appear in court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the public prosecutor's office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington strikes out against toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his swordsmanship as Jon Snow in HBO's exciting medieval colored fantasy series Game of Thrones.
A 31-year-old actor who has sharply condemned the stereotype of a masculine hero, says that due to the appearance of such roles on screens, young boys often feel that respect can only be earned through toughness.
Kit told The Sunday Times Culture that he thought something went wrong, and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity during the period of the #JazTudi movement.
The actor, who recently married a 31-year-old co-star from Game of Thrones Rose Leslie, admitted that he has strong beliefs about the subject.
“I’m personally seriously wondering at the moment where we made the mistake when it comes to masculinity,” he said.
“What did we teach men as we grew up about the problems we now face?”
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity due to the display of very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is learned?
What do we learn on television and in the streets that young boys feel they have to choose this particular aspect of manhood?
I think one of the important issues of our time is how can we change that?
“Something went wrong with young people.”
In an interview, he also said that after the series ends next summer he will not be involved in any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones because he “closed with battlefields and horses.”
In November, Kit will star in a new production of True West by Sam Shepard, a story about a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The player recently revealed that the best thing that happened because of Game of Thrones was that he met his wife Rose on film.
“Because of this series, I met my wife, so she somehow gave me my future family and life from here on out,” he said.
In an Emmy-winning fantasy series, Rose played Ygritte, the beloved character of Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslie’s family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people in the country are affected.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the disease has been transmitted through sexual intercourse, which represents a change compared to the past.
Typically, the HIV virus spread rapidly in some parts of China due to a transfusion of infected blood.
However, according to Chinese health officials at a conference in Junan province, the number of people infected with HIV has dropped to almost nothing.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is still increasing by 100,000 a year.
The transmission of HIV through sexual intercourse is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very prevalent.
Since conservative values are still in place in the country, according to research results, 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry a woman.
The disease is often transmitted due to inadequate protection during sexual intercourse in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to medicines for the treatment of HIV as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaking information about Republican senators, condemns “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff had posted information about three U.S. Republican senators on their Wikipedia website.
The Los Angeles Democrats said the accusations were coming from individuals and far-right websites.
"Lies, lies, and more inadmissible lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information reported includes the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from Capitol Hill, during a Senate session on allegations of sexual harassment of the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kanaugh.
The leak came after the three senators concluded with Kavanaugh's interrogation.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState state that it is possible to identify the source of the publication, which is supposed to be linked to Senator Waters’ office, via the IP address, and conclude that the information was published by one of the staff, Hill reports.
“These unfounded accusations are completely false and pure lies,” Waters said.
“My employees, whose identity, personal information and security are threatened by these false accusations, are in no way responsible for leaking this information.
These unfounded accusations are completely untrue and pure lies.”
Senator Waters' statement quickly came under fire online, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“It is out of this denial that anger grows,” Fleischer wrote.
“This may not be the right test for Congress.
When you accuse someone of something they haven’t done, they shouldn’t show anger.
He can't resist.
And he must not doubt the motive of the one who accused him.
He has to stay calm.”
Fleischer compared Waters's response to Kavanaugh's democratic criticism, which he was accused of being too obviously angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running for Waters City in the midterms, tweeted.
“If it’s true, it’s serious,” he tweeted.
In a statement, Waters said her cabinet had “informed the appropriate institutions and law enforcement authorities regarding these false accusations.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators will be exposed,” she continued, “and that they will be held accountable for all acts that are harmful and dangerous to every member of my staff and to all of them.”
Johnny English back in action - Rowan Atkinson as secret agent
The search for suggestions for Brexit in any new British film has become traditional, and also applies to the revival of the action comedy Johnny English, which first appeared on the screen in 2003 under the title Johnny English and a sequel in 2011 under the title Johnny English 2.
Will the fun satire about how bad we are be a new export opportunity for us?
The incompetent Johnny English, with his swollen eyes and unusual makeup, is given permission to remix the stencils; already his name suggests that it is a comical character created for cinematographic audiences in non-English-speaking areas.
It’s an awkward undercover agent who, despite his bizarre moves, contains a piece of Clouseau, Mr. Bean’s cane, and the trifle of the one who contributed the last note to Chariots of Fire at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
It is also based on the traveler and the international mystery man Atkinson once played in a now-forgotten TV ad for Barclaycard, leaving behind a real chaos.
In the latest film, one or two pleasant moments are presented.
I liked it when Johnny English was approaching in a helicopter, wearing a medieval armor, and the rotor blades were touching his helmet for a short time.
Atkinson's gift for comedy is clearly shown, but humor seems somewhat mild and excessively unnecessary, especially since "serious" films like 007 or Mission impossible now without a bad conscience offer comedic elements.
It seems like humor is aimed at children and not so much at adult viewers, which is why for me the repulsive events of Johnny English are not as innovative and oriented as Atkinson’s silent sketches in the role of Mr. Bean.
The constant issue now is clearly that the UK is in serious trouble.
A web hacker has infiltrated the network of Britain's most secretive agents and revealed the identities of all British agents, causing great trouble for the competent agent, who in a surprisingly small role is represented by Kevin Eldon.
This is the breaking point for the prime minister, a pompous figure who has already experienced a breakdown due to political unpopularity: Emma Thompson has tried her best with the role of supposed Teresa May, but there is nothing tangible in the script to help her.
The Intelligence Service informs her that all active spies have been exposed, so she must opt for one of the retired spies.
And that means Johnny English, now a teacher at a reputable school, who informally teaches how to act undercover: here are the screenwriters hit, because English runs some kind of espionage “rock academy”.
English is taken to Whitehall for an emergency meeting, where she meets longtime colleague Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a stereotypical sports enthusiast, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine is barely lost.
Batman and Robin are ready to create even more trouble on behalf of Her Majesty's Secret Service, while they encounter the fatal Ophelia Bullet, played by Olga Kurylenko.
In the meantime, the prime minister is in danger of falling under the influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: this is the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey: dressed as a waiter, they set fire to a French restaurant, create chaos when she smuggles on to the roof of Volt's yacht, and when English tries to use glasses for apparent reality to get to know the interior of Volt's house.
Although the last part contains all the necessary ingredients, despite the sympathy and energy, it is reminiscent of a children's film.
Very average.
Like other Johnny English films, I can’t help myself here, and I think: is the British film capable of giving Atkinson a role that actually justifies his talent?
Labour denies that they are planning a four-day working week for the British, and they would be paid for a five-day working week.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical plan where Britons would work four days a week and receive a five-day paycheck.
A client of business leaders wants the savings created by companies as a result of the Artificial Intelligence Revolution to flow to workers and give them an extra day off.
In this way, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend at the same high salary.
Sources say the idea fits the client’s economic plan and plans to put the state on the side of workers.
Trade unions support the transition to a four-day working week, as this is a way for workers to take advantage of a changing economy.
A Labour source told The Sunday Times: “The policy review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-week workweek is a goal that we will strive to achieve with a customer’s approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of the worker and the customer’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as a four-week working week in its campaign in the 2017 general election supported the Green Party.
The Labour Party as a whole does not currently support this goal.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “The four-week working week is not party policy and the party is not thinking about it.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour conference last week to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to seize the power of “disregardless directors” and “profiteers” in utilities.
The Chancellor’s plans in the shadows also mean that current stakeholders in water companies may not regain their full share, as the Labour party could introduce “deductions” based on alleged wrongdoing.
It also approved plans to include workers on boards of directors and the introduction of Ownership Inclusion Funds, thereby transferring 10 per cent of the share in private companies to employees, thereby receiving annual dividends of up to GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy discussed whether Kavanaugh's investigation by the FBI could change their views on the show.
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week and raises the question of whether the findings of any Republican senator’s office could convince the judge to withdraw his support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, a correspondent for the 60 Minutes show, Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, asked if the FBI could discover anything that would change its mind.
Kennedy seemed more open to this than a colleague from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“Before the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
When I called him when this accusation came up, I asked him, ‘Did you do that?’”
He was determined, unwavering, undoubted.”
Graham's voice seems to have been carved into stone.
“I created my opinion of Brett Kavanaugh and I would need an extremely compelling reason to change it,” he said.
“I don’t know what happened to Dr. Ford, but I know the following: Brett strongly denied it,” Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of those whom she had called could confirm it.
The case is 36 years old.
I don’t see any new changes.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it contributed to reducing poverty in any way?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizens Festival, an annual music event featuring a truly extraordinary line-up of stars and with the same extraordinary mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
Tens of thousands of people will take part in the festival, which will take place this week. They will occupy the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy the performances of musicians such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to arouse interest in the real purpose of the event for years to come.
The Global Citizens Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Citizens Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free event ticket (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert participants had to perform a series of tasks or “acts” such as volunteering, a letter to the world leader, a phone call, or any other meaningful way to increase awareness of their goal.
But how successful is the Global Citizen movement, which has 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to convince them to ask for action, or is this just another example of so-called “clickivism” – creating the belief that people actually have a significant impact on the situation by signing an online petition or tweeting?
According to the Global Citizen Movement, more than 19 million of its supporters have been involved in the pursuit of a range of goals since 2011.
He says these actions have helped world leaders make commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group stated that its actions are expected to result in 390 commitments and communications that have already paid or raised at least $10 billion.
The group estimates that the funds raised so far have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and decision makers committed to “helping children realize their full potential,” which Rwanda has pledged $35 million in aid to help eliminate malnutrition after more than 4,700 countries received Global tweets.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and global citizens like you, we can put the social injustice of malnutrition in historical archives,” Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of the Power of Nutrition Partnership, told a crowd at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that the government, following more than 5,000 actions that have called for the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, announced that it will co-finance the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutritional measures.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, “Why do you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?”,
The Global Citizen movement responded: “This will be a long and hard road – sometimes we will fall and we will fail.
But just like the big civil rights movement and the fight against apartheid ahead of us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Some of the performers who will perform at this year’s event in New York include Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e. The event will be led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. Could Use Navy to ‘Block’ Russian Energy Exports – U.S. Department of the Interior
U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke reportedly told the Washington Examiner newspaper that Washington could use its navy “if necessary” to prevent Russian energy trading, including in the Middle East.
Zinke said that Russian intervention in Syria (it should be noted that at the invitation of the legitimate government) is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I think the reason for their presence in the Middle East is the desire to market energy, as they market it in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe,” he said.
However, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
“The United States can do this. The Navy will make sure that our sea routes are open and block them if necessary, thus preventing Russian energy from flowing to the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed participants at the event hosted by the Energy Consumers Union, a non-profit group dubbed the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approach to Russia and Iran, noting that it is actually the same.
“As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic possibility is more or less an impact on fuels and their replacement,” he said, calling Russia a “one-trick pony” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements were made at a time when the Trump administration is striving to increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, where it is supposed to depose Russia, which is a significantly cheaper choice for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to abandon the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which is said to have made Berlin the “hostage” of Moscow after Trump.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline, worth USD 11 billion, which is said to double its existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington forcibly opposes the project only for economic reasons and that it is unfair competition.
“In my opinion, we have the same view that energy should not be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should have the right to choose their suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a September meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow.
Germany rejected the U.S. position and confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the German Industries Association (BDI), has called on the US not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"The involvement of a third country in our energy supply is a big problem for me," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Association (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren to 'exactly consider' her candidacy for U.S. President in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "exactly consider" her candidacy for U.S. president after the midterm elections.
At a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running for office.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government, which requires a female leader,” she told The Hill.
“After November 6, I will carefully consider my candidacy for President.”
At a meeting in the House of Commons, Warren lashed out at President Donald Trump for "leading this country in the wrong direction."
“What Donald Trump is doing to our democracy is very worrying to me,” she said.
Warren has been openly criticized by Trump and Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh on several occasions.
In a tweet released on Friday, Warren said, “Of course, we need an FBI investigation before the election.”
A poll released on Thursday showed that most of her own constituents believe Warren should not run for president in 2020.
According to a poll by the University of Suffolk’s Political Research Center/Boston Globe magazine, the senator should not run for president, fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters.
Thirty-two percent of them would support her candidacy.
The poll showed that former governor Deval Patrick was more supportive of the candidacy, with 38 percent of respondents supporting it and 48 percent opposing it.
The other high-ranking Democrats who would be eligible for the 2020 election are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden, according to the Associated Press, said he would make a formal decision by January.
Sarah Palin at a meeting in support of Donald Trump mentioned the post-traumatic stress disorder Track Palin
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the military.
He was arrested on Monday night and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through, what he is going through after his return, connects me to other families who are dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder and a certain degree of injury that our soldiers are returning to,” he told audiences at a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
She described Palin’s son’s arrest as an “elephant in the salon” and said her son and other war veterans are returning slightly altered, sturdy, wondering where the respect for what the soldiers and airmen and all other members of the army had given to the state is.”
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence with assaulting a woman, obstructing reporting domestic violence, and possessing weapons in the guilty state, Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police station, said.
18 federal states and the District of Columbia support the reversal of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal reversal of the new U.S. policy, which denies the right to asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
NBC News reported that representatives from 18 countries and the aforementioned district filled the courtroom on Friday to support a legal reversal of the policy.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the U.S. Civil Liberties Union against federal policymakers has not been disclosed.
She said her partner and “his violent sons, members of the gang,” abused her, but on July 20, U.S. authorities rejected her request for asylum.
He was arrested in Texas.
The state prosecutors of the states that support Grace have described Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which many asylum applications to the United States come, as countries that are constantly facing problems with gangs and domestic violence.
In 2014, a new U.S. asylum policy repealed a decision by the Committee on Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy “disregards decades of state, federal, and international law.”
“Federal law requires that all applications for asylum be assessed on the basis of the individual facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates this principle,” the court said.
Prosecutors said in the request that a policy that denies immigrants the right to enter is harmful to the U.S. economy, as they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary workforce.”
U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear related to race, religion, nationality, or membership in an individual social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a June 11 policy statement.
Asylum was never meant to eliminate all the problems, even the serious problems that people face around the world every day.
The number of victims in Palau has doubled, but desperate rescue attempts are underway to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
“The feeling is very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she comforted her hot boy at an evacuation center in the ravaged city of Palu.
“The rescuers are constantly bringing in the bodies.
There is a lack of clean water.”
They seemed to be citizens, returning to their ruined homes, breaking through wet things and trying to find anything useful.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals destroyed by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake were overloaded.
Some of the injured, including Dwij Haris, who suffered a back and shoulder injury, were resting outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outdoors for constant strong aftershocks.
When he remembered the violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was living with his wife and daughter, his eyes filled with tears.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was squeezed against the ruins of the walls,” Harris told the Associated Press, adding that he was in town with his family due to the wedding.
“I heard a woman call for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Insulting’ with ‘Propaganda Ads’
A week after the publication of a four-page advertisement in the official Chinese newspaper, which praised the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of misusing the U.S. press for spreading propaganda.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump mentioned a paid addition to the China Daily on Sunday in the Des Moines Register, Iowa’s best-selling newspaper, after China accused it of meddling in U.S. congressional elections on Nov. 6, which China denies.
Reuters reported that U.S. federal officials have described Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in U.S. federal elections as a new phase in Washington’s increasingly intense effort to pressure China.
Although it is common for foreign governments to publish ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently embroiled in an increasingly intense trade war in which they exchange blows by imposing tariffs on imported goods.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war are said to affect exporters in states such as Iowa that support Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a column in Sunday’s edition of the Des Moines Register, “now doubles this harassment by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“In spreading propaganda, the Chinese government has used the esteemed American tradition of free speech and free press to publish a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the other hand, you will see very few other opinions on the newspaper stands in Beijing and no real reflection of the diversity of opinions held by Chinese citizens about the troubling Chinese economic path, since the Communist Party of China is tightly controlled by the Communist Party of China,” he wrote.
He added that “one of the most important Chinese newspapers has refused an offer to publish” his article, although he did not specify which.
Republicans lose voters ahead of midterm elections with Kavanaugh crackdown, analysts warn
Analysts warn that the support of many of the most important Republicans who support and advocate for the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, despite several accusations of sexual assault, will be known in the upcoming midterm elections with the loss of voters.
Emotions are extremely high here, and most Republicans have already said they want to continue voting.
This cannot be reversed,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell University’s Syracuse University, said in an article published Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher said he doubts Senator Jeff Flake's pressure to investigate the FBI at the last minute will be enough to calm angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, neither will they forget tomorrow nor November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national representative of the advanced group MoveOn, according to a report by the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November is Coming!” as they demonstrated in the Senate Hall of Fame when Republicans overseeing the Judiciary Committee decided to continue supporting Kavanaugh’s appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic news portal reported.
“Democrats’ enthusiasm and motivation will transcend all boundaries,” Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, told reporters.
“People say they’re already strong, and that’s true.
But it could be even stronger, especially among undecided suburban voters and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who don’t like the president, but don’t vote often.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which she detailed her allegations of sexual assault by a candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts said further Republican support could have negative consequences.
“This has become a big mess for the GOP,” Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Council, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just a world vote or a final vote or Kavanaugh’s oath; it’s also about how Republicans deal with Republicans and how they treated Ford,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, which supports Democrats in the election, told the TV channel.
Americans, on the other hand, seem to be somewhat divided over whether to believe the testimony of Ford or Kavanaugh, with some more supporting the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents either believe Ford’s testimony or believe Kavanaugh the most, and 35 percent of respondents said they believe Kavanaugh the most.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied while testifying, and only 30 percent said that about Ford.
Under pressure from Flake, the FBA is currently investigating allegations made by Ford and at least one other defendant, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Council that Kavanaugh assaulted her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that a candidate for the Supreme Court showed her sex when they were together at a party during their Yale University studies in the 1980s.
The inventor of the world's internet plans to start a new internet to deal with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world wide web, opens a startup that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technological legend, Inrupt, is a company building on Berners open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's purpose was "to rule the world."
“We decided to do it now,” he said of the new company.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid platform technology, which allows users to create a “personal data storage” or POD
This can include contact information, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s similar to how Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser at a time.
The peculiarity of personal data storage is that the user can fully determine who can access which information.
This is known as “Personal Data Authorization”.
CEO John Bruce says the company’s idea is to bring together the resources, processes and relevant skills that will allow access to the Solid platform for everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, a few hired developers to work on the project, and a community of volunteer developers.
Already this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and the group “do not discuss with Facebook and Google whether they could bring about a complete change that could overnight abolish all their business models.”
“We don’t ask for permission.”
In a statement on Medium, Berners-Lee said: “Inrupt’s goal is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Berners-Lee will also remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely optimistic about the next era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: First World War VICTORY CROSSING FESTIVAL
In their hometown, for 100 years, they have celebrated the award of the Victoria Cross to the only priest of the Church of England who won it as a fighter in the First World War.
Venerable Lt. Col. Bernard Vann earned the distinction on 29 September 1918 in the attack on the Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But four days later he was shot by a sniper, so he never found out that he had been awarded this highest British military honor.
On Saturday, at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, two of the Colonel's grandsons discovered a memorial stone.
One of his great-grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was “extremely symbolic” that the stone had been discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s act, which earned him the distinction.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt. Col. Vann led his battalion through the St. Quintin’s Canal “through a very dense fog and under the strong fire of a battlefield and machine guns.”
Later, he flew toward the line of fire and, with “greatest heroism,” led the line forward, then attacked the machine gun himself and hit three members of the squad.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanna was shot dead by a German sniper on October 4, 2018 – just a good month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his father’s actions were “something I know and could never achieve, so he teaches me humility.”
After the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, they laid a wreath with their brother, Dr. James Vann.
Michael Vann said he felt “very honored to be able to participate in this parade,” and that “the courage of a true hero is reflected in the support that many people will give.”
Enthusiasts of mixed martial arts have been waving all night to watch Bellator 206. Instead, they were enjoying the Pigs of Pepe.
Imagine: You've been waking up all night to watch the fully sold-out Bellator 206, and then you can't see the main event.
The event in San Jose involved 13 duels, including six on the main floor, and was broadcast live on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom.
At 6:00 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to clash, viewers in the United Kingdom were shocked to find that the broadcast had been replaced by the play of the cartoon Pooh Pep.
Many were not very excited, because he stayed up until the morning due to the duel.
One of the enthusiasts on Twitter described the switch to a children's cartoon as "a kind of sick joke".
“According to government regulation, this content is not appropriate at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to a children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the transfer.
"Pujsa Pepa." Yes.
Bellator’s president, Scott Coker, said they are trying to adjust the schedule to include viewers in the UK in the future.
“When I think about replaying, I think we could fix that,” Coker said.
“But then it’s six o’clock in the morning on Sunday and we won’t be able to fix that until the Sunday of our time or the Monday of theirs.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, many messages were exchanged during the switchover and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it; we assumed it was just a technical error.
The real reason, however, was a government regulation.
I can promise you this won't happen again next time.
Instead of six, we’re going to have five fights – as usual. We’ve tried to offer fans more than we expected, and we’ve counted on that.
This is a very ungrateful situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels “Deficit” About Sexuality
Olympic divers Tom Daley said he felt inferior to everyone because of his sexual orientation – but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he realized that “not everyone is like himself” when he entered high school.
Speaking on the first episode of Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne for Radio 4, he said he talked about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that by the time he became a parent, his desire to win the Olympics had diminished.
The regular host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, was absent due to a multi-month illness.
Daley, who appeared as an outcast on Laverne's first show, said he felt "less worthy" than everyone else, as "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, these feelings of inferiority and difference are the real thing that gives me the strength and perseverance to achieve success.”
He wanted to prove that it was “something,” he said, so as not to disappoint anyone who would finally find out about his direction.
The two-time bronze medalist has become an influential advocate for LGBT rights and has appeared twice at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call on countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke because he felt happy, that he could speak openly without consequences, and that he wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said the romance with a man — American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 — “surprised him.”
Daley married an Oscar winner who is 20 years older than him last year, but says the age difference has never been a problem.
“When you’re so young,” he said, “at the age of 14 he attended the first Olympic Games and three years later his father died, it’s hard to find someone of the same age who would experience similar ups and downs.”
The couple adopted Robert Ray Black-Daley's son in June, and Daley says his "whole view" has changed.
“If you asked me last year, all I had to say would be, ‘I have to get a gold medal,’” he said.
“But, you know, there are bigger things in the world than Olympic gold medals.
“My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
The son bears the same name as Daley’s father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he would have to die, and one of the last things he asked was whether he already had tickets for London 2012 as he wanted to sit in the front row.
I couldn’t say to him, “This time it won’t be you first, Dad,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally had to admit that he wasn’t invulnerable,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I knew this was what I’ve been dreaming of my whole life — diving at the Olympics in front of my home audience. There was no better feeling,” he said.
This also inspired his first choice of song – the stream of the musician Heather Small, which was accompanied by him in preparation for the Olympic Games and which still gets his skin wet.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11.15 (BST).
Mickelson won the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday as he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but will have to return to form again so it won’t become an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who will participate in the biennial event for the record-breaking 12th time, was let sit by Captain Furyk at the Saturday Four.
Instead of being at the center of events as was so common for the United States, the five-time winner spent the day partly as a fan and partly improving his game to fix what weighed on him.
Considering that even at the peak of his career he did not measure the most straight, the 48-year-old does not fit best at the narrow Le Golf National, where long ice inevitably punishes missed shots.
And if just the pitch wasn’t scary enough, Mickelson will be dealing with the exact winner of the British Open Francesco Molinari in the ninth game on Sunday, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood in the lead-up to the win in all four games this week.
If Americans, who have at the beginning 12 individual games four games less, had a good start, Mickelson’s game could prove decisive.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his man, but he did not say much.
“He fully understands the role he played today, he patted me on the back and hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is one of the famous and has contributed tremendously to the teams in the past and also this week.
I didn’t think he would play two games.
I imagined more, but that's how it came out, and we thought that's how it should be done.
He wants to play like everyone else.”
Mickelson will break Nick Fald’s record for the most games played in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This could mark the end of Ryder's career, which never really matched the height of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furyk said his presence on the team also introduces some inconceivable benefits.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to be crazy about people and it’s great to have him in the team space,” he said.
“I think the younger players had a lot of fun when they had a fight with him this week, which was fun to watch.”
“It’s a lot more than just a game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a big advantage can soon be skipped
Thomas Bjorn, a European captain, knows from experience that an important advantage at the start of the last day of individual Ryder Cup games can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.
The young Dane made his debut in 1997 at a game in Valderrama, where the side, captained by Seve Ballesteros, had five points ahead of the Americans, and through the goal he crossed with a hair-only advantage, with a score of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“Don’t forget that we had a lot of advantage in Valderrama; we had a lot of advantage in Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won, but barely,” Bjorn said (pictured) after seeing the Class of 2018 team win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday’s 10th round of the National Golf Championship.
History for me and everyone on the team shows that the cup is not over yet.
Play the full game tomorrow.
Go and do whatever it takes.
The game isn't over until it's written like this on the board.
We have a goal to win this cup, and we need to stay focused on that.
He’s always saying that I’m focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we also know who’s on the opposite side – the best players in the world.”
Excited about his players’ playing on the challenging pitch, Bjorn added: “I would never overtake here.
Tomorrow will be a different day.
Tomorrow will be a game of individuals, so it will have to be dealt with differently.
It’s nice to have a partner when things go well, but when you’re there alone, your golfing skills are tested to the end.
This is the message you need to convey to the players: Tomorrow you need to get the best out of yourself.
Now leave your partner behind, and he has to get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will encourage his players to play better than they played as a partner, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself was on both sides of the upheavals on the last day, as he was part of the winning team in Brookline before ending up as a loser when Europe performed the "Miracle in Medina".
“I remember every damn word,” he said when asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, told his players on the last day of the game.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but we would like to start as fast as we saw in Brookline, as we saw in Medina.
When this start-up gains perseverance, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfielders.
We created the right layout and put the guys in the way we felt we were going to do something magical tomorrow.”
Thomas was assigned the task of trying to lead the battle and battle Rory McIlroy in the best game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will be the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
“In this group of guys, I chose this order because I think it covers the whole schedule,” Bjorn said of the choice of individuals.
New German warship rescheduled
The latest frigate of the German Navy should be put into service in 2014 to replace the aging warships from the Cold War, but due to system failure and rapidly rising costs it will not be until at least next year, local authorities reported.
The handover of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the new class of the Baden-Wuerttemberg frigate, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing the military representative.
The vessel should join the Navy in 2014, but the ambitious project is fraught with worrying issues after delivery.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships, commissioned in 2007, will replace the aging Bremen-class frigate class.
They are expected to have a powerful gun, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some concealment technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance intervals – the latest frigates are expected to remain outside their home port for up to two years.
Continuing delays mean that the warships, which are supposed to enable Germany to exert its influence overseas, will become obsolete by the time of the start of use, says Die Ziet.
The unfortunate F125 frigate appeared on the front page last year when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time that the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, and the German authorities have cited a number of key "programming and technical shortcomings" that would render the warship useless if it were sent on a combat mission.
The software flaws were particularly significant, as the Baden-Württemberg-class vessels will be operated by a crew of around 120 sailors – only half of the workforce on older Bremen-class frigates.
It has also been shown that the ship is very heavy, which reduces its capacity and limits the Navy's possibilities for its future upgrade.
The 7000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz was twice as heavy as the German-style ships used in World War II.
In addition to the lack of equipment, the cost of the entire project has also become a problem – including the training of the crew.
This is expected to reach a dizziness of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (US$3.6 billion) – from the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany’s naval strength is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the navy was indeed "lack of ships suitable for deployment."
The official said that the issue was exacerbated over time because the old ships were decommissioned and no replacement vessels were provided.
He regretted that no ship of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the navy.
The National Fund is listening to the secret life of bats
A new study is taking place on a property in the Scottish Highlands, in which they are trying to discover how bats use their diet in the hunt for food.
They hope that the results will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
In the research, scientists from the National Fund for Scotland (NTS) will monitor small bats and small bats and brown catch bats and peripheral bats on the Inverewe Gardens estate in the Wester Ross area.
In the key locations of the estate, special recorders will be placed to monitor the activity of bats throughout the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using manual detectors.
A professional sound analysis of all the recordings will confirm the frequency of calls of bats and what types of what they do.
They will then prepare a habitat map and report to create a detailed picture of their behavior throughout the province.
Rob Dewar, an NTS nature conservation adviser, hopes the results will show which habitat areas are most suitable for bats and how they are used by each individual species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of lawns and the conservation of forests for bats and other related species.
The number of bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has declined sharply in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects shelters and habitat loss.
The risk is also posed by wind turbines and lighting, as well as fleas and certain types of chemical processing of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Butchers are not blind.
Because of their night-time hunting habits, they help themselves more with their ears than with their eyes.
To accurately determine errors and obstacles on the flight path, they use a sophisticated echolocation technique.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It employs ten experts who regularly carry out research, inspections of shelters and occasional rescues.
The organisation has even established the first and for now only Scottish reserve on the property of Threave in the area of Dumfries and Galloway, specifically intended for bats.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
“We have a great bat area in Threavu,” he said.
“We have old buildings, many ancient trees and all the quality habitat.
But there is still a lot known about bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
He stressed the importance of checking the presence of bats before carrying out maintenance work on the estates, as the possible unintentional destruction of a single bat nursery can result in the death of up to 400 females and puppies, which can mean the collapse of the entire local population.
Bats are protected, so it is forbidden to kill, harass or disturb them, and it is also forbidden to destroy their maternity wards.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scotland’s head of the Bat Conservation Fund, encouraged the public to participate.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many species we simply don’t know how well their populations are doing.”
Ronaldo Rejects Rape Allegations, Lawyers Preparing to Sue German Magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the allegations of rape "fake news" and said people wanted to "promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which has published the charges.
The attackers of Portugal and Juventus were accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he would then pay her $375,000 for silence about the event.
Speaking to 142 million followers on Instagram Live several hours after reporting, Ronaldo, 33, called the reports “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said was fake news,” the five-time Golden Ball winner told the camera.
“By using my name, they want to promote themselves.
That's normal.
By mentioning my name, they want to become famous, which belongs to the work that I do.
I’m a happy person and I wish everyone well,” the actor added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for charges they have called “unacceptable reporting of suspicions about privacy.”
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "income damages in an amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident was reported to have occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to the documents filed in Clark County, Nevada, after a meeting at Mayorga's nightclub, Ronald was supposed to return to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and told her that he was “99 percent a good man” who disappointed only “one percent.”
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed sexual intercourse, but he described it as consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she referred to the police and that photographs of her injuries were taken in the hospital, and later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "a terrible fear of revenge" and was concerned about "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old says she wants to cancel the settlement as she continues to suffer serious trauma due to the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was at the time of the alleged attack just before transferring from Real Madrid to Manchester United, and this summer, according to an agreement worth $100 million, he moved to the Italian giant Juventus.
BREXIT: UK ‘would regret forever’ loss of car makers
The UK would “forever regret” losing its status as the world’s leading car manufacturer after Brexit, Secretary of Business Greg Clark said.
He added that it was “concerning” that Toyota UK told the BBC that a no-deal UK withdrawal from the EU would temporarily halt production at a factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant – which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models – produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I think if the UK leaves the European Union at the end of March without a deal, production at our factory would stop,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director at the Burnaston plant.
Concerns about how a no-deal exit from the European Union will affect cross-border trade have also been expressed by other car manufacturers in the UK, including Hondo, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers call the risks associated with the supply chain, in the case of Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on the principle of “in good time”, with parts of suppliers from the UK and the EU for custom cars coming every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, it could cause disruptions at borders, which industry representatives say could lead to stalemate and shortages of parts.
Toyota could not store more than one day of parts at its factory in Derbyshire, the company said, so production would stop.
Clark said Theresa May’s plan for future relations with the EU was “precisely scaled to avoid such border checks.”
“We need to reach a deal. We want to reach the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy our current success, but to seize this opportunity,” he told BBC Today’s Radio 4.
“The data not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers is that we need to be absolutely able to continue a highly successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota was unable to comment on how long production would be halted and warned in the long run that additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at the Burnaston factory for 24 years and is the founder of the Unita union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, the lost job is never returned.”
The government representative said: "We need to present a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says White House
Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed “for another week” due to ongoing fighting over Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nominee, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who studies Russian pre-election meddling, links between Trump’s associates and Russia, and potentially the president’s obstruction of the judiciary.
The question of whether Trump will fire the Attorney General’s envoy and endanger Mueller’s independence has been fuelling Washington’s rumors for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the use of a wiretap to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
Last Monday, he visited the White House, in the midst of reporting that he intends to resign.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, which was then held at the United Nations conference in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said Rosenstein “would rather not” be fired, and the meeting was then postponed to avoid conflict with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of inappropriate sexual behavior, Dr. Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long probe into Kavanaugh’s allegations, further delaying the Senate vote.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date has not yet been set for him. It could have happened this week, and given everything else going on in the Supreme Court, it could have been postponed for another week.
We’ll see. I always like to make sure you’re informed.”
Some reporters would object, but Sanders hasn't called a White House meeting with reporters since September 10.
Chris Wallace, the head of the show, asked her why.
Sanders said the rarity of the meetings was not to be attributed to opposition to the “setting up” of TV reporters, but she said: “I couldn’t deny that they were setting up.”
She then mentioned that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president is holding more press conferences than any president before him,” she said, adding, without citing a source: “We’ve looked at the numbers.”
“But if journalists can address the President of the United States directly with their question, it is infinitely better than discussing it with me,” Sanders said.
We are trying to make this possible, and you have seen that we have done this many times over the last few weeks and that you will have a conference available to talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting statesmen.
Independent press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, when he appeared freely and partly bizarrely in front of assembled journalists.
Letter from the Minister for Health to the EU workers at NHS Scotland on the fears related to Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote to the EU staff working at the Scottish NHS to express the gratitude of the state and the desire to continue work even after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, an SME, sent the letter less than six months before the United Kingdom left the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed to paying the costs of applications to regulate the status of EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “Negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on withdrawal continued during the summer, with decisions approaching this autumn.
But the UK government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal exit scenario.
I know this must be a time of great concern for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the European Union and non-member countries bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health sector and benefit the patients and communities we provide.
You can feel at home in Scotland, and we really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie Urgently Operated After Head Injury
Line supporter of the Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, suffered an emergency operation after a head injury in Saturday's 31:27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of The Tennessee newspaper reported.
The head coach of Tennessee State University told reporters that the injury happened just before noon.
“He came to the edge of the field and kind of collapsed there,” Reed said.
Trainers and medical staff supplied Abercrombie with oxygen on the edge of the field before putting him on a stretcher and taking him off the field for further examination.
An official at Tennessee State University told Chris Harris of the WSMV channel in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie is recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “details of the type/scale of the injury are not yet known” and that the Tennessee State University is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, who is currently a rookie at the university, plays for Tennessee State University for the first time since transitioning from the University of Illinois.
On Saturday, he had a total of five shots before leaving the game, raising his total number of shots in the season to 18 shots.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax on the purchase of real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax when buying a property in the UK, and additional money will be used to help the homeless according to the new plans of the Tories
The move will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters
Increased premium will be charged to those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
“Foreign buyers will be charged a higher rate of premium when buying real estate in the UK, and the money raised will be for the homeless,” Theresa May said.
The move should be understood as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and higher taxation for high-income people.
The increased premium will be charged to individuals and businesses who do not pay tax in the UK, and the additional money will encourage the government’s efforts to eliminate homelessness.
The surcharge – which will be charged in addition to the current premium, including the raised levels introduced two years ago for other homes and broadcast properties – could amount to no less than three percent.
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year with the introduction of the measure.
It is estimated that non-U.K. citizens would buy 13 percent of the newly built London properties, resulting in higher prices and a harder purchase of the first property.
Many rich areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “spirit cities” as the number of buyers who spend most of their time outside the country increases.
The new policy was adopted only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in breastfeeding to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
Large construction companies have accused the price hikes by grabbing land they don’t actually use, and Ms Mayevo has called for abandoning quotas for affordable housing in order to fix the British “residential embarrassment.”
Mr Corbyn has announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including rent control and a flawless end to forced evictions.
It also wants to give city councils more powers to build new homes.
Mrs Mayeva said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my premiere leadership to rebuilding the British dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
This also means the correction of our inactive housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and create their own lives.
However, it cannot be right that for people who do not live in the UK and for foreign companies, buying a home is as simple as it is for garage British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of their own home is all too far away, and the humiliation of homelessness remains all too real.”
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to manage Scotland”
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his “final goal” is to one day become manager of Scotland.
The 42-year-old enjoys the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which currently holds third place in the First League, with three points less than the top-ranked.
He moved to the Stadium of Lights this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Championships last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as an actor.
I got a B cap and that’s it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportssound.
“But I grew up watching Scotland as a child in Hampden, so it was always something that drew me back.
This opportunity would only be offered to me if I were successful in running the club.”
Ross's predecessors at the head of Sunderland were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic team boss, who had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town, says he didn’t feel fear as a successor to such big names.
“Success is measured for me by the question, ‘Can I bring this club back to the First League?’”
“Given the structure and capacity of the club, it is undoubtedly a Premier League club,” he said.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I would probably only be successful if I could get the club back there.”
Ross has only been a manager for three years after being an assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months with the Hearts coaching staff.
Alloi then helped prevent a third-league breakout, and St Mirren led from the edge of the breakout to the championship title next season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real breakthrough,” recalled the takeover of Alloe.
“I was really convinced that management was the right thing for me, much more than playing.
It’s funny to hear, because as a player I was doing well, I had a relatively good time with it and I’ve also achieved some major successes.
But the game can become difficult.
Every week we have to face a lot of things.
I still struggle with this in terms of stress and pressure at work, but I just feel management is the right thing for me.
I’ve always wanted to run a club, and I’m doing it now, and I feel the most comfortable in my entire adult life.”

The ideal time for a beer is on Saturday at 5.30pm.
The summer heat has increased the revenues of hard-to-break British pubs, but the pressure on the chain of restaurants has also increased.
Groups of pubs and bars increased sales by 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA’s business adviser, who compiled the data, said: “Sustainable sunny weather and England’s participation in the World Cup, which lasted longer than expected, meant that July followed a similar pattern as June last month, when pub revenues increased by only 2.8 percent.
The drop in restaurant traffic by 1.8 percent in June was further increased in July.
Traffic in pubs and bars with drinks increased more in comparison to each other as traffic in restaurants decreased.
Due to the sunny weather, sales in pubs, which mainly offer food, have also decreased, but not as dramatically as in restaurant managers.
It seems that people just wanted to go for a drink.
In various pubs and bars, sales of beverages increased by 6.6 percent in one month, and food sales decreased by three percent.
Paul Newman, RSM’s group of leisure and hospitality analysts, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
When selling in the catering market, the biggest factors of the weather and the influence of large social or sporting events remain.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to struggle, although the drop of 4.8 percent on an interannual basis will be particularly painful due to continued cost pressures.
For food-hungry homeowners, a long hot summer could not come at a more wrong time and only time will tell if the necessary recovery will bring the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August.”
Total sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, were 2.7% in July, indicating a slower roll-out of brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, a sales benchmark in the pubs, bars and restaurants sector, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 business groups with a total turnover of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is a well-established industry benchmark.
One in five children has a secret account on their social network that they hide from their parents.
The study found that one in five children – some of whom are just 11 years old – has a secret account on the social network, which he hides from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 students showed the growth of fake Instagram pages
The news has intensified fears about the publication of sex-related content
Twenty percent of schoolchildren said they had a “main” account for their parents.
One in five children - some of whom are only 11 years old - creates an account on social networks that he hides from his parents.
A survey of 20,000 students showed the rapid growth of fake Instagram accounts.
The news has intensified fears about the publication of sex-related content.
Twenty percent of schoolchildren said they manage a censored “main” account that they show to parents, and they also have private accounts.
A mother who accidentally stumbled upon the secret page of a 13-year-old daughter noticed that the daughter was inviting visitors to rape her.
A survey conducted by the Digital Awareness UK network and the Conference of Directors of Independent Schools (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11-18-year-olds have two profiles, with half admitting to having a private account.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create an online space where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to be ‘voice of athletes’ at Scottish Athletics Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as the non-executive director of the annual general meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is Scotland’s most distinguished field and outdoor athlete, and President Ian Beattie has described this move as an excellent opportunity for those directing the sport to harness her extensive experience internationally over the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and global athletics community. We are confident that the athletics in Scotland would benefit greatly from its inclusion on the committee,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I’m excited to be able to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope to be able to really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won a total of four Olympic medals in the 200-meter and 400-meter races at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and is now a regular commentator for the BBC, has been left speechless after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I can recover and to what extent.
The work was hard, but I recovered completely, learned to walk again, and today I am doing agile exercises!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!”
An ad for a breast pump that compares mothers with cows, shared online reviews
The company, which produces breast pumps, has shared opinions with an advertisement that compares mothers with cows in molluscs.
To launch the “first silent portable breast pump,” consumer technology company Elvie has released a provocative music video ad that is supposed to show mothers all the freedom the device allows.
Four real mothers dance in the company of cows in a barn filled with hay, on a song that includes the following text: “Yes, I’m pumping, but there’s no tail,” and “If you haven’t noticed, these aren’t my tits, these are my tits.”
The congregation continues: “Exhaust, exhaust, feed babies, exhaust, exhaust, squeeze breasts.”
But the ad, which was posted on Facebook’s website, caused considerable discontent online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it was joking at the expense of the dairy industry’s “horror.”
“The use of cows to advertise this product is a very bad decision.
“Like me, they also conceive and suckle to produce milk, but their babies are stolen within the first few days of being born,” she wrote.

Another commented: “Of course it’s traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their children?”
Someone else added: “An advertisement completely without feeling.”
Others praised the ad, with one of the women admitting that she thought the song was “for squeaking funny.”
“I think that’s a brilliant idea.
I would have bought it if I was still breastfeeding.
I felt like a cow when I was pumping.
The ad is a bit crazy, but I understood it, just as it was meant to be.
“It’s a great product,” the other wrote.
Someone commented: “It’s a funny ad targeting mothers who are milking out (often at work or the toilet) and feel like cows.”
This is not an ad that praises or condemns the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women reveals that they were dancing with hidden pumps in their bra.
The concept of action is that many women who pump their breasts say they feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and fits discreetly into the breastfeeding bra, allowing women to move, hold the baby and even outdoor activities while pumping milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Maternity, further commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative presentation.”
With the passage of the parallel between women who pump milk and dairy cows, we wanted to put milk pumping and all its challenges in the spotlight, while at the same time, in a fun way that women can connect, show an incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will be.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump has come to the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children walked on the model trail for designer Marta Jakubowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Silently Relocated to Tent Camp on Texas Border
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply, even though the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies put in place by the Trump administration have made it difficult to hand the child over to sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors are undocumented migrants, which is why they fear that asking for a child would jeopardize their own chances of staying in the country.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other family members of households would have to provide fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had asked for unaccompanied minors to be sponsored.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
“Almost 80 percent of people who are either sponsors or household members of sponsors are illegal in the country, and a large part of these are punished by foreigners.
Therefore, we continue to search for these individuals,” Mr. Albence said.
In order to speed up the treatment of children, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within one month of being detained, not after 60 days, which was the previous standard, shelter workers said.
Many will appear with a videoconference call and not in person to defend themselves before an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed not to be eligible for aid will be expelled quickly.
The longer children are in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged in the system in recent months.
Proponents said that these concerns are greater in larger institutions, such as Tornilla, where signs of child distress due to their size are more likely to go unnoticed.
They added that moving children to the city of tents, without emotionally preparing them for it or giving them a chance to get fame from friends, could complicate the trauma many of them face.
Syria calls on U.S., French and Turkish “occupation forces” to withdraw immediately
In an address to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moualem called on Syrian refugees to return home even though the country has been at war for the eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as the deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces on Syrian soil were illegal, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that "they will act accordingly."
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the congregation.
Moualem said the “war on terror” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions had to leave their homes, was “almost finished.”
He said that Damascus will continue to “fight this holy battle until the Syrian territory is cleared” of both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United Nations has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the territory of this war-torn country.
Regarding refugees, Moualem said the conditions for them were suitable for return, accusing “some Western countries” of “spreading unreasonable fears” that convinced refugees to stay abroad.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to contribute to their easier return,” he said.
“They are changing the political issue, which should be an exclusively humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned Syria that it will not receive reconstruction funds until Assad and the opposition reach an agreement on the end of the war.
U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a tampon zone at the last major rebel base, Idlib, has created an opportunity for further political talks.
The Russo-Turkish agreement has prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on a province home to three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had a “clear deadline” and expressed hope that military intervention would target jihadists, including Nusra Front fighters linked to Al Qaeda, who “will be eradicated.”
United Nations envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meeting of a new committee of government and opposition members soon to prepare a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem defined the Syrian government’s conditions for participation in the committee, saying the committee’s work should be limited to “a review of the articles of the current constitution,” and warning of interference.
Why Trump will get a second term
After this conclusion, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 re-election unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, his presidency ends prematurely with an interpellation and scandal.
Which would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of the presidency ever!”
There are no signs of tiredness for the time being.
Since 2014, CNN’s viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million at the time of peak viewing, and MSNBC’s viewership has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at its peak, which is more than four years after Nielsen had 1.7 million, and The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC reached the highest number of cable customers with 3.5 million viewers at night.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, director of the drama Designated Survivor, about the cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, acclaimed whistle-blower and author of “Just Funny Parts: And Some Hard Truths About Cheating at the Hollywood Boys Club,” offers a different interpretation.
Remember the taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election?
The driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why, she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Ms. Scovell told me.
There's a fun value in chaos.
Of course, contrary to what is seen on television, the Washington story could decide the future of the Roe v. Wade case in terms of whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Nevertheless, a six-hour round-table look at experts discussing the use of a “deep-backed” source for Bob Woodward’s “Fear,” a $15,000 worth of leather jackets made of velvet (“clothes, thickly padded with inflatables,” The Washington Post) and the aftermath of this, Trump said.
I'll never look at Super Maria the same way again.
“A part of what he does, which gives the impression of a reality show, is to offer something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” about the casting of Trump’s show and the day-to-day twists of the script.
You can't afford to miss an episode, otherwise you're in a bit of a lag.
When I was talking to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees (26.7°C) outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was confused inside watching MSNBC when he was filming CNN.
He couldn’t help himself, even when Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate committee and hung the future of the Supreme Court in the air.
“I remember when we were making all these crazy shows and people were saying, ‘This is the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Foreign money accrues in preparation for the tightest midterm parliamentary elections
It is not surprising that in the 17th district of Pennsylvania, they are seeing a flood of money, as due to the redevelopment of congressional districts, two candidates found themselves in the race for the same seat.
The newly divided suburb of Pittsburgh is home to Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in special elections this spring in the second district.
Lamb is competing with another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which is heavily overlapping with the new 17th district.
The cards were rewritten when a Pennsylvania Supreme Court judge ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally drafted in favor of the Republicans.
The contest in the new 17th district touched on the fight to fund the campaign between the main party financial bodies, the Congressional Committee for Democratic Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the widely-followed March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th district.
This seat has been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The U.S. was considering sanctions against Salvador for supporting China, then withdrew.
Diplomats have found that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners expelled the leadership of the Trump Organization.
U.S. Foreign Ministry officials have decided to revoke U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama following “recent decisions to end the recognition of Taiwan,” ministry spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions were being considered for El Salvador, which is estimated to receive $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including aid to combat drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included a restriction on financial assistance and a targeted visa restriction, would severely affect this Central American country with high unemployment and the number of murders.
During the internal meetings, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic development to continue a similar meeting last year, which was assessed as a step forward in preventing migration towards the United States.
By mid-September, top government officials had clarified that they wanted the conference to continue, ending reflections on the penalties for Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now tasked with speaking to participants at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, a sign of the importance the U.S. government attaches to the meeting, diplomats added.
Three U.S. envoys have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to the discussion on condition of anonymity.
Their testimony was confirmed by an outside analyst, who is close to the government and has also spoken about it under the condition of anonymity.
Historical Comparisons
The next unpleasant news could be a report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on a possible obstruction of the judiciary, of which there is already a great deal of evidence in the public records.
Mr. Mueller is also said to have directed the investigation into whether Mr. Trump’s campaign was cooperating with Russia in the attack on the US election.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to answer the authorities, and perhaps even the jury of his colleagues, just as he prepares to speak to his constituents again.
There are many questions and I do not want to say that Mr Trump's downfall is inevitable, nor are his peers in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we will have to make decisions that will affect how long the fight could be.
In 1938, German officials were prepared to strike at Hitler if the West resisted him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We did not succeed, so we missed the opportunity to avoid the years of worship that followed.
At such turning points, the course of history is changing and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
Americans are dealing with several such breakthroughs right now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been in turmoil since this newspaper reported that last year he proposed a covert filming of the president and speculated about his inappropriateness for that position.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times' report was inaccurate.
“How will we respond if the FBI investigation requested by Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or fair, or if he is appointed Supreme Court Justice despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will demand Mr. Trump's responsibility?
If we fail these tests, we will have a long winter of democracy.
But I am sure that we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jewess who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later ordered me to light a sabbatical candle on a table with swastikas.
How could we not be optimistic about our future with such a legacy?”

Ranger Graham Dorrans optimistic about Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, with it being clear that their victory over the Austrians after an impressive rematch against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month will put them in a convincing position to qualify for Group G of the European League.
A knee injury prevented tiebreaker Graham Dorrans from appearing for the first time in the season ahead of a 2:2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this as a springboard for greater achievements.
“It was a well-deserved point for us because Villarreal is a strong team,” the 31-year-old said.
“We came into the game in the belief that we can achieve something and take the point.
You might be able to win in the end, but in general, remi is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but we showed up and we were a better side in the second half.
There will be another big European night on Thursday.
We hope that we can get three points, but it will be a difficult game, because in the last game they have achieved a good result, but with the crowd behind us, I am sure that we can try and achieve a positive result.
"Last year was undoubtedly difficult, given everything that has happened, including the injuries and changes at the club itself, but I have a good feeling about this place now.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; training is good.
I hope we can continue now, leave the last season behind and achieve success.”
Poor sleep for women due to fear of savings
Despite the fact that the respondents had a clear idea of how to take care of them, only a few people talk to their family members about it.
Half of survey respondents to the Nationwide survey said they are talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of them said they were talking to children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t make an effort to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, VP of Life Insurance at Nationwide.
You can start in the following way.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare a family to take care of you if you don’t talk to them about it in time.
Talk to your counselor and family about where and how you want to receive care, as this can be an important factor in assessing costs.
Include a financial advisor: Your financial advisor can help you find a way to pay for these costs.
Your choice of financing long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a combination of cash value and life insurance policies to cover these costs or self-insurance with your own funds, if you can afford it.
Prepare the necessary legal documents: Prepare for legal battles during the transition.
Choose a health care representative by identifying a trusted person who will supervise your health care and ensure that professionals will take your health care wishes into account if you are unable to communicate.
Also consider empowering a person for your finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid if you are unable to do so yourself.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent urgently needs medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write this information in the action plan to be ready.
“It’s not just about your finances. Do you know the doctors?” asked Martin.

Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise further.
With communications interrupted, rescuers from the Donggal regency, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicentre of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, were unable to obtain any information.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palau after the earthquake.
Some key facts about Palau and Donggali in Saudi Arabia:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi, a province located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi and estimated to have a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a province that stretches along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The Regency, an administrative unit under the province, had an estimated population of 299,000 in 2017.
The main economic activities of Central Sulawesi are aquaculture and agriculture, in particular in the central region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also an important activity in the province, but mostly in Morovaly, on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Natural Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Donggalo have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, the tsunami also struck northern Donggalo, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on the quake-active Pacific Ring of Fire, which is why earthquakes occur regularly here.
In recent years, some major earthquakes and tsunamis have been as follows:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of India, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck western Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that flooded its southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 quake occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands and triggered tsunamis up to 10 meters high, which destroyed dozens of villages and caused the deaths of about 300 people.
2016: The melting of the earthquake affected the reign of Pidie Jay in Aceh and caused death and panic when people remembered the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time the tsunami was not triggered, but the collapsed buildings caused the death of more than 100 people.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily detained thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A 29-year-old man from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of reporting domestic violence and opposition to arrest, the Alaska State Troopers police agency said on Saturday.
According to a police report, Palin took the phone from his contacts when they tried to call the police to report the alleged crime.
Palina has been detained at Mat-Su Prednisolone and is in custody under an unsecured $500 guarantee, the KTUU television network reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he said he was “definitely innocent” when asked about the plea, the network reported.
Palina has been charged with three Class A offences, meaning he could be jailed for up to one year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with one Class B offence, punishable by one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
Burning of the crime is not charged for the first time.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, meddling in domestic violence, and possession of an alcoholic weapon in connection with the incident.
Palin's girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans in 2016 when she linked her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder after returning from military service in Iraq.
Tsunami quake in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A magnitude 7.5 quake triggered tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been disrupted and the death toll is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just off central Sulawesi, which lies northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There are videos circulating on social media that show the moment of the earthquake.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people were detained at the beach festival in the town of Palu.
U.S. Attorneys Rarely Call for Death Penalty for Terrorist Suspect in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Sajfulla Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people. It is a rare punishment that has not been carried out for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a hired delivery truck to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan when he drove several pedestrians and cyclists in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious bodily harm, according to a notice of the death penalty application filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, the reason for the death penalty may be any of the charges.
Several weeks after the attack, the Saipov grand jury indicted a 22-point indictment that included eight counts of murder in aid of extortion, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and counts of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for “substantial planning and inclination,” prosecutors said, describing Saip’s way as “disgraceful, cruel, and depraved.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drak, Ariel Erli, Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Ferruchi, Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Diego Mendoza, and Alejandra Damiana Pagco.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The Southern District District Court passed its last death sentence 10 years ago.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers and sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The death penalty in New York City in a federal case was last imposed in 1953 on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed for conspiring to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were killed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, did not show regret in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
According to police, he told investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
After the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by videos of ISIS that he watched on his phone.
Police also said that he had requested an explanation of the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
With regard to the 22 points of the indictment, he declared himself innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were “obviously disappointed” with the prosecutor’s decision.
"We believe that a decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting the admission of guilt in return for life in prison without the possibility of release for all involved will only prolong the suffering associated with these events," Patton said.
Saip's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Negotiations on Brexit should be entrusted to NIGEL FARAGE, says Tori MP
Nigel Farage pledged to “mobilize the people’s army” during a protest at the Tory Conference.
Ukip’s former leader said politicians should “feel the heat” of Eurosceptics when one of his own MPs, Theresa May, suggested she should be in charge of negotiating with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said during a campaign in Birmingham that the United Kingdom “would be out by now” if Mr Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the challenge that Mrs. Mayeva faces in coordinating her deeply divided species was highlighted by the Tories, pro-Brexit renunciations, who joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep her plan on track between the attacks of Brexit advocates, Brexit opponents and the EU.
The Allies insisted that Mayeva in Brussels would try to reach a deal despite opposition and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and “chaos.”
Mr. Bone is at the Leave Means Leave convention in Solihull to “want to get rid of Chequers.”
He said we should appoint Mr Farage as our interlocutor and assign him responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was in charge, we’d be out by now,” he said.
This Wellingborough MP added, "I will support Brexit, but we need to get rid of Chequers."
He described his opposition to the EU as follows: “In world wars we did not fight to be servants now.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bone rejected the proposals that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely untrue.”
Andrea Jenkyns, a Tories Brexiteer, told reporters: “I’m just saying, ‘Minister President, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, but it is also unpopular with our client and our activists who are active on the streets and lead us to elections at all.
Please leave the Chequers and start listening.”
In a message addressed to Mrs. Maye, she added: “Premiers keep their job when they keep their promises.”
Mr Farage said at the meeting that politicians should be given “feel the heat” if they plan to issue a decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us — the people — and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to issue a Brexit, and today we’ve come together to tell them, ‘We’re not going to let you do that.’”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the brink of Brexit, to feel the heat.”
“We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that has assured us victory over Brexit, and we will not stand still until we become an independent, autonomous, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, the resters walked through Birmingham, where they then had a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
A handful of activists waved Torijci flags against Brexit this weekend after the group was formed.
The Labour nobility Lord Adonis ridiculed the Conservatives because of security issues when using the client app after the conference opened.
“These are the people who tell us that they can set up IT systems and all the technology for a Canada plus plus deal, for a border without stops, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren's possible bid for the position of president will be "exactly studied"
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “exactly study participation in the presidential race” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a meeting with citizens in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is often critical of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts election campaign.
It is at the heart of speculation that it could deal with Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters in the form of a "town hall" since Trump became president.
One of the participants asked her if she intended to run for the post of president.
Warren responded that it was time for “women to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government, which requires a woman at the top.”
Arrested after death of LSU player Sims in shooting
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said on Saturday they had arrested a suspect in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayd Sims.
The Baton Rouge police station reported the arrest of 20-year-old Simpson at a news conference at 11:00 a.m.
They posted a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help identifying the man in the video.
A 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed early Friday near the University of the South campus.
“Wayde Sims was shot in the head and eventually killed,” Police Chief Murphy J. Paul said, according to 247sports.
Wayde intervened to protect his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted at the hearing that he was at the end of the incident, that he had a gun and that he had shot Wayd Sims.
The Simpsons were arrested and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 198-centimeter youngster who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starts last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 jumps per game.
The Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approached the title of world champion, and the team ordered him to leave the victory to Sebastian Vettla
On Saturday, as Valtteri Boltas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton, it became clear that "Mercedes' team will have a strong influence on the race".
Bottas started well at the start and almost left Hamilton on the dry as he defended his position in the first two bends and invited Vettle to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to drive into boxing and let Hamilton drive on the tail of traffic, which should be decisive.
Mercedes drove into boxing later and left him behind Vettlom, but after some driving action, Hamilton noticed that Ferrari's driver's dislike left the inside open and risked falling behind in the third corner after two defensive moves.
Max Verstappen started from the last row of the grid and was in seventh place until the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then most of the race was driven without changing tires, as he intended to make a quick finish, overtake Kimi Raikkonen and take fourth place.
He finally drove in the 44th round, but was unable to increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikkonen took fourth place.
It’s a tough day as Valtteri drove fantastically all weekend and was a real knight when he let me out.
The team has done a really great job to reach first and second place,” Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday for her insistence on not disclosing a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly touch Ford’s testimony before the Senate Investigative Committee, but said instead that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are “evil, corrupt, and lying.”
“The only beautiful thing that can happen and that has happened in the Senate in the last days that we can see anger when you can see that people are mean, corrupt and lying,” he said.
“When you look at revelations and revelations, people say, ‘No, I didn’t do it.’”
I didn’t do that.”
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you reveal that?
Remember her answer... you exposed the document – ‘Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no.
I didn’t disclose it.”
All right, wait a minute.
We have revealed it to us ... No, we have not,” he added regarding the impression of the senator.
Ford sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and it was revealed to the media in early September — but Feinstein denies it came from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn’t disclose her letter,” she told the commission, according to The Hill Feinstein.
“She asked me for confidentiality and I kept it confidential as she asked.”
But her denial apparently did not fit the president, who said at a Saturday night meeting: “I tell you, that was really bad body language.
Maybe not, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Defending a Supreme Court nominee accused by three women of inappropriate sexual behavior, the president suggested that Democrats abuse accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain their power by all means possible.
“You have seen the evil, the ugliness, they don’t care who they are hurting and who they have to beat to power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs Belfast Giants: 5:3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Velikanes against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars have redeemed themselves for Friday's loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning Saturday's match at Dundee with 5-3.
The Giants scored two goals against Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized for the home side, and then Dwyer again achieved an advantage for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard equalised for the Dundees before two goals from Lundvald Nielsen secured them the win.
It was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe, who beat Dundee 2-1 from the back on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the teams, with the Giants winning in the previous three games.
Dwyer scored his first goal in the game in the fourth minute with 3:35 assisted by Kendall McFaull, Beauvillier, who scored four minutes later by David Rutherford.
In the intensive introductory part, Sullivan led the home side back to the game at 13:10, while Matt Marquardt gave Cowny a draw at 15:16.
Dwyer took care of the Giants' lead on vacation when he hit his second goal of the evening at the end of the first third.
The home side gathered again, and Bouchard compensated for the setback with a violent goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen lead Dundee to the lead at the end of the second third and ensured victory by the fifth goal of his team's half and ensured victory by the fifth goal of his team's last third.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play their next game at home in Milton Keynes on Friday.
An air traffic controller has allowed hundreds of people on the plane to escape from the quake with his death.
Air traffic controllers in Indonesia celebrate as a hero after sacrificing his life so that a plane with hundreds of people could safely take off.
More than 800 people were killed in Friday’s earthquake on the island of Sulawesi, which was followed by a tsunami.
The area continues to be shaken by strong aftershocks, and many people are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although the co-workers fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung did not leave his job in a heavily squatted control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He remained in it that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the runway, could safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the control tower because he thought he was fighting.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia’s Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian media outlet ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter to transport him from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our heart beats when we hear it,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, as the country's disaster mitigation agency said access to the cities of Donggal, Sighi and Boutong was limited.
“The death toll is expected to increase as there were many bodies under the ruins, many of which we could not reach,” said a spokesman for the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho news agency.
Palu, where the mass funeral will take place on Sunday, has been devastated by waves up to six meters high.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute a rescue vehicle brings in the bodies.
It lacks clean water.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
It’s a tragedy now, but it can get even worse.”
On Sunday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu and addressed the national army: “I ask all of you to work night and day to fulfill all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?” according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugini now says one person is missing after plane crashes into lagoon
The airline, which operated the flight that crashed into a Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, now says one person is missing after it was originally reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement Saturday afternoon that a male passenger was missing.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the missing person.
The call for more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality, did not respond immediately.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water when it tried to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said there were eight passengers left in the hospital on Saturday, all of whom were in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon just outside the track.
Some witnesses said the plane missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed very low.
“That’s great,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he, along with other passengers, managed to break through the water reaching the belt to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants panicked and screamed, but he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors who repaired the nearby pier also jumped in to help with the rescue, using an inflatable boat that transported people to land before the plane sank into about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
According to the Air Safety Network, 111 people have died in air accidents in Papua New Guinea in the past two decades, but this is the first accident that has happened to Air Niugini.
The analyst determined the time of night when a woman was burned alive.
The prosecution on Saturday presented its evidence in a retrial to a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used phone records to determine the movement of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the eve of her death, which contradicts his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police contacted Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When asked by prosecutors if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s truck that night, he said he “lied because [my] truck was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said that Chambers had known him for about two weeks at the time she died.
The video on their cell phone shows that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at the time of Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted Chambers' texts, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“He wiped her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is expected to present its final arguments on Saturday.
The judge said the trial was to be judged by a jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip-Hop?
Hiphop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The Bristol-based group The High Breed claims that hip hop has distanced itself from its original political and social commitment.
They want to return to its roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a resurgence in the UK with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York babysitter sues couple for being fired for 'racist' message
The New York City babysitter sues the couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misrepresented message from a mother who complained she was “another black woman.”
The couple denies racist behavior and compares the lawsuit to “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed disappointment in 2016 when she found out about the arrival of her new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, that she was a black woman.
“NEEEEEEEEEE ONE MORE BLACK,” Plasco-Flaxmanova wrote in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Mrs. Maurice.
After discovering her slip, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt “unpleasant,” fired Ms. Maurice, saying that her outgoing nanny, who was African-American, was doing a poor job, so she wants to hire a Filipina.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for a day's work, and then she was sent home with Uber.
Maurice is now seeking compensation from the couple in court in the amount of $350 per day for a period of six months to perform the work for which she was originally hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them, you know, things like that don’t happen,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to the accusations of racism by claiming that Maurice’s dismissal was reasonable, fearing that they would no longer be able to trust her after the apology.
“The woman sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racist,” Joel Plasco told The Post.
Would you be willing to trust your children to someone you were rude to, even if it happened by mistake?
Your newborn?
Come on.’
Comparing the lawsuit to “emigration,” Plasco said his wife had given birth just two months ago and was in “a very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to get over someone like that?
It’s not very good,” the investment banker added.
Although the court proceedings are still ongoing, the court of public opinion has quickly condemned couples on social networks because of their behavior and way of thinking.
Publishers of Paddington Bear Stories Fear Readers Won't Connect with the Speaking Bear, New Letter Reveals
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after receiving the book, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who first read the book before it was published.
It’s so much fun to find out now that Paddington has become a huge hit.”
She said her father, who initially worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write a children's book about a little bear toy, would be outraged at the rejection of his work, adding that after his death last year was the 60th anniversary of the book "bitter-sweet."
Regarding the Paddington Bear, who she described as “a very important member of our family,” she said that her father was very proud of his ultimate success.
“He was a man who didn’t like to brag,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if your child had achieved something: You are proud of him, even if you don’t really do it yourself.
I think he looked at the success of Paddington's bear in a similar way.
Although it was his idea and his imagination, the success was always attributed to Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say that she felt really bad, that she didn’t expect this to happen,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
“That’s when I got Nad’s call, he told me she was going to die in the next two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, sweetheart.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
Medications given to her by doctors to keep pumping her heart were slowly swallowed and left her system.
She had been dying for a while, and that was the end of her life.
All I had to do was sit back and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by family and people.
I really had to endure.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan Laperouse, who was already mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers, unaware of the ordeal she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I had my head down and tears were running down my cheeks all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I felt this strong feeling of sympathy for Nada on the plane.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women’s lamentable sticker posters to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost their loved one to suicide try to distract others in order to take their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys on a Welsh bridge paste posters with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can turn to for support.
Mrs. Tyler's son was 13 years old when he fell into depression, and he killed himself at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I do every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile brightened every room.”
But before his death, he stopped working because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found his cousin when he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said: “I am constantly worried that the domino effect will be triggered.”
Mrs. Davis made posters, “to let other people know that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
“Don’t sit in silence, you need to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who had been Davies' friend for several years, lost Marka, who had been her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed or depressed or anything,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas Day, he was completely on the ground; when the children opened the presents, he didn’t make eye contact with them or anything like that.”
She said that his death was a serious trauma for them, but they have to process it: “She cut a hole in the whole family.
She tore us apart.
But we have to keep going and fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs in the air at the start of the FBI investigation
“I thought that if we could actually carry out what he asked for — a limited investigation, for the duration and scope of it — it might unify us,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the world would “disintegrate” because of the hardened party stalemate.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their resistance is due to the time in which the investigation would take place.
The midterm elections, which will take place on November 6, are just five weeks away – if Republicans cut off badly, as expected, this will greatly weaken them in an attempt to elect the desired man to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush phoned the senators several times to lobby for support for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and was introduced by him to his current wife, Ashley, who is now Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen when the FBI prepares a report?
The Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will hold a vote.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh could get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would bring Mike Pence, the vice president, a breakthrough from the post and an election to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees has declined under Kim.
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Byeong-seug Park, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Reunification, said 1,127 people had fled last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the key factors were tighter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as rising prices demanded by human smugglers.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly on this yet.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are finally offering South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them cross China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than a heavily secured demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants and not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South – which are technically still at war – have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on stalled denuclearization negotiations.
This came after a June historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they broadly agreed to strive for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Jong-ho, blamed US sanctions on the stalemate.
“Without U.S. confidence, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm,” Mr. Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and says he’s not fit for a job at the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader of the House of Representatives, called Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court candidate “hysterical” and said he was characteristically unsuitable for a job at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t think of anything other than to call a woman ‘hysterical,’” Kavanaugh’s testimony Thursday before the Senate inquiry committee commented on Pelosi.
Kavanaugh vehemently denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In the recital, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost screaming, and suffocated when discussing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the commission and called the accusations against him a “gross and coordinated bragging” organized by the Liberals, angry that Hillary Clinton had lost in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she felt that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not be appointed as the supreme judge, as it showed that he was biased toward the Democrats.
“I think he has been discredited with these statements and the way he has dealt with Clinton and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi is asked if she will attempt to file a constitutional indictment against Kavanaugh if it is confirmed and the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives for a moment.
“If Congress or the FBI doesn’t tell the truth, it’s inappropriate not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court it’s in now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington.
Pelosi said that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decision against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade's case, as she was considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questioning whether he would overturn some of the Supreme Court’s decisions.
“Now is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Isn’t that wonderful?’” said Pelosi.
And the woman must be swayed.
This is a fair fallout, after months and years of pouring out anger, and can not express it without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s rare, do you?”
She continued: “I was helped a lot by a woman who was a director, who was also crying when she was angry, but she developed a technique, and when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, ‘Maybe I’m sorry.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept going.
I thought it was superb.”
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger in part because people misunderstand them.
One of my strongest memories of my early career, when I was still working in an office dominated by men, and I once found myself crying in inexpressible anger, was an event when an older woman grabbed me by the neck – a cold leader who had always sneezed at me.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“They won’t know you’re angry.
They’ll think you’re sad, and they’ll be glad you’ve been touched.”
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught jumping over the fence in a boat called Monkey Business and had to step out of the game, she was shocked to find that there was no reason why she could not run for president on her own.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she laughed at me 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates in the game and another one was the last thing needed at the time.
At that time, someone called the game “Snow White and the Seven Thumbs.”
Since she joined the last campaign, she was lagging behind in fundraising, so she decided not to enter the game if she did not raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave men $1000, gave her only $250.
“Do they think I’ll get a discount?” she asked.
When she announced in the conversation that she would not start an official campaign, emotions — gratitude to the people who supported her, dissatisfaction with the system that made it so difficult for her to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, and anger at sexism — so overcame her that she began to suffocate.
“You would think I was having a nervous breakdown,” Mrs. Schroeder recalled from the media’s reaction.
“You would think my official sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they were going to write on my gravestone.
“Did she cry?”
How the U.S.-China War Could Benefit Beijing
The initial salvos of the U.S.-China trade war have been deafening, and while the battle has not ended long ago, experts say the split between countries could benefit Beijing in the long run.
U.S. President Donald Trump launched the first warning at the beginning of the year by taxing key Chinese export items, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new tariffs on goods worth USD 200 billion (GBP 150 billion), effectively meaning taxing half of all goods coming to the U.S. from China.
Beijing has each avenged itself with equivalent retaliatory measures, most recently with tariffs ranging from 5 to 10 percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China, the world’s second-largest economy, has pledged to move eye to eye with the United States and is unlikely to blink anytime soon.
In order for Washington to resign, China would have to agree to his demands, but public removal of the US for Chinese President Shi Jinping would be too shameful.
Experts say, however, that if Beijing knows how to make the right moves, U.S. pressure in the trade war could have a long-term positive impact on China by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that would trigger an economic upheaval in any of the countries is actually far more dangerous than observers have thought so far,” said Abigail Grace, an expert in the Center’s field, who is now focusing on Az.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help in rebuilding a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moualem said the situation in the country is improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer because of the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now fulfilled for the voluntary return of refugees who had to leave the country because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures directed against their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
The other six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that sponsored the rebels.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National in Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup since 1993.
Europe won the crown again when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn scored 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems throughout most of the championship, threw the ball into the water at the 16th hole in the par-3 game in his initial shot, which forced him to hand the game to Frances Molinaria.
Italian golfer Molinari shined through all rounds and became one of four players to have ever since the start of the championship in its current form in 1979 achieved a score of 5-0-0.
The American Jordan Spieth defeated the lowest-ranked player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark with 5 and 4.
The world’s top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2–1 to England’s Ian Poulter, who may have played in the Ryder Cup for the last time.
Veteran of the eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the most successful European player of all time with 25.5 points.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t help myself today.
This year has been difficult.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for picking me up and believing in me.
I'm so happy, I'm so happy that we won the cup again.
It’s a team and I’m really happy to be able to help,” Garcia said emotionally after the European victory.
The relay is handed over to fellow golfer John Ram, who on Sunday defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in individual games.
“I’m incredibly proud that I managed to beat Tiger Woods, and as I grew up, I watched his games,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games he played in France, and now holds a career record in the Ryder Cup 13-21-3.
This is an unusual statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, right behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team has been struggling for a week to find the right path, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have been playing golf at a high level throughout the championship.
The American captain, after a bad performance for his team, said, “I’m so proud of these guys, they fought.”
In the morning, we put a lot of pressure on Europe.
We've failed.
Hat down in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played very well.
We'll have to get back together, work with the PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee, and move on.
I really love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
Cap down.
They overplayed us.”
