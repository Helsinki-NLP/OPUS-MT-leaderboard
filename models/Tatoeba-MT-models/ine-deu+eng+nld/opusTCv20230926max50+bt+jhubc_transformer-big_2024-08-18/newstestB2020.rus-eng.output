The Kazans in the Russian championship suffered four defeats in a row, and also flew out of the Cup.

So we all have to think about the reasons for such a bad game.
There are still meetings ahead - we need to prepare for them and correct the situation.
- What?
If we had known, we would probably have corrected it already.
But first of all, I think we need to add in such a component as combat.
In my opinion, we have problems with this.

China strongly opposes the adoption of the U.S. "Taiwan Bill"
China strongly opposes the adoption by the US of the so-called “Taiwan Bill”, which seriously violates the principle of one China and the principles of three Chinese-American joint communiqués.
This was stated on Friday by the official representative of the Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of China for Taiwan Ma Xiaoguan.
The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee’s approval of the bill is also a serious violation of international law and fundamental principles of international relations and gross interference in China’s internal affairs, Xiaoguan said.
According to him, Taiwan is part of China, and the issues related to it relate to China’s internal affairs.
“We call on the American side to clarify the situation, immediately stop promoting the relevant negative bills, and immediately stop interfering in the Taiwan issue to avoid further damage to Chinese-American relations, as well as to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.”
China must and will be reunited.
This historical trend cannot be stopped by anyone and no forces, Ma Xiaoguan stressed.
TikTok hides unwanted videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of which are under the age of 18
Imagine China / Reuters
China’s TikTok social network censored videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibet’s independence or a banned religious group Falun Gong, The Guardian reports.
The documents found at the publication, it is said that the owner of TikTok (ByteDance company) with the help of the application promotes the goals of the foreign policy of China abroad.
Most of the violations related to China’s policy fall under the “incitement of hatred”.
In each case, TikTok places objectionable posts in a context appropriate to the general rules so that the actions of the social network do not look censored.
For example, the ban on criticism of the socialist system of China falls under the general ban “criticism or attacks on the politics and social rules of any country, such as the constitutional monarchy, the parliamentary system, etc.”.
The ban on mentioning incidents in Tiananmen Square or genocide in Cambodia falls under the “distortion of the history of China or other countries.”
The document also gives a list of the banned names of the twenty "foreign leaders or government officials" of Nakhor Udai, including the North Korean leaders Kim Jong-Ira, Kim Il-Sen and Kim Jong-un, the Indian politician Mahatma Gandhi, the American presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Yapon.
Prohibited material is divided into two categories, as stated in the document.
Posts from the first category are deleted by the administrators of the social network and may result in the user being blocked.
Not too severe violations belong to the second category: such publications remain on the site, but their distribution is limited by TikTok algorithms.
Representatives of ByteDance told The Guardian that these rules have become obsolete and no longer apply: "We are now using a localized approach to moderation, as well as attracting independent local specialists."
Russian TikTok users have no specific restrictions on publication, says Rustem Bogdanov, co-founder of the Production Center.
“Production Center” is one of the Russian media companies that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All advertising materials of bloggers "Production Center" agrees with representatives of the social network, but user materials can be posted without consent, reports Bogdanov.
When asked whether it is possible to speak about politics or Putin in TikTok, Bogdanov answers in the affirmative and says that he has seen such publications.
Roman Zaripov, founder of Our Didgital, agrees with Bogdanov: “The basic rules for users of TikTok are listed in the user agreement: you should not post shocking content, discriminatory statements and so on.”
But these rules can include any content that moderators do not like, Zaripov notes.
Zaripova Agency is another Russian partner of TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of which are under the age of 18.
By user agreement, TikTok can only be used by persons over the age of 13.
Social network administrators check their age with artificial intelligence: the neuronet analyzes faces and determines how old a person looks, says Bogdanov.
If the neuronet decides that the user is younger, his account can be removed, he adds.
According to RBC, in September 2019, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on the territory of WeWork.

Russians have been warned about fake calls from banks
In Russia, the number of calls from fraudsters who change the phone number of the bank has increased.
This is reported by Kommersant with reference to the data of the Central Bank.
In the summer of 2019, the regulator transmitted information to communication operators about more than 2,500 numbers from which customers of various financial organizations were called.
In 189 cases, the operators found a substitution of the number.
Another 218 numbers were blocked, and in 59 cases a restriction on the use of financial services was imposed.
Deputy head of the information security department of the Central Bank, Artem Sychev, said that a wide range of Russian banks faced a number change.
He explained that the operators do not always respond to the Central Bank’s warnings about fraudulent calls, citing the absence of such an obligation in the Law on Communication.
In the bank "Otkrytie", Rosbank and Alfa-bank confirmed the information about the increase in the number of fraudulent calls with a change of number.
As reported in the press service "Beeline", part of the information about fraudulent calls that the Central Bank transmitted was incorrect: the lists included numbers that are really used by banks to communicate with customers.
Blocking them would lead to failures in the work of the organization.
Artem Sychev said that the Central Bank plans to create a database of fraudsters' numbers, to which the communications operator will be contacted every time the number is checked.
He explained that the creation of such a basis would require amendments to the legislation.

Stoltenberg discussed with Zelensky the accession of Ukraine to NATO
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky discussed Ukraine’s membership in the alliance on the sidelines of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly.
The Secretary General spoke about this during a speech at Columbia University in New York.
Asked if the topic was raised during the meeting, Stoltenberg said that they really discussed the issue, and also stressed that he did not specify the deadline for Ukraine to join NATO in his response.
According to him, any country that would like to join the North Atlantic Alliance is obliged to meet certain conditions to meet specific standards, writes RT.
In Crimea offered to Zelensky an alternative course in NATO
The President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky instead of the course of joining NATO should deal with the establishment of good-neighborly relations with Russia.
This was announced on Friday, September 27, by the Co-Chairman of the Assembly of Slavic Peoples of the Republic of Crimea Roman Chegrinets.
"Mr. President of Ukraine should not repeat the mistakes of his predecessor, but should listen to the advice of [US President] Donald Trump, which he listened to with a sour face, and establish relations with the President of Russia," Chegrinets told reporters at RIA Novosti.
Chegrinets noted that Zelensky is a good actor for him, but a bad politician.
According to him, the Ukrainian president will only be able to remain in power if relations with Russia are established.
Earlier on September 27, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that he had held an interview with Zelensky on the topic of the country's accession to the alliance.
According to him, for this, Ukraine is obliged to meet certain conditions.
On June 5, Yevgeny Balitsky, a member of the Rada, said that the possible accession of Ukraine to the alliance does not guarantee the improvement of life in the country.
Money is more important than football.
Barcelona blackmails Neymar
Spain’s Barcelona and its former Brazilian player Neymar are trying to settle a financial dispute that arose after the striker moved to France’s Paris Saint-Germain.
The case was almost brought to court, but the Catalans offered the player to settle the dispute without the intervention of Themis.
Otherwise, they will refuse to return.
Neymar and his cunning father, who is also an agent of the Brazilian, set an interesting focus: under an agreement with Barca, which the player signed in 2016, he was to receive 40 million euros.
However, just a year later, the forward was in PSG for a record 222 million euros.
However, he received 22 million from the Catalans and now wants to take the remaining 18.
Not only that, the Brazilian lawyers insist that the club owes him also interest for late payment.
When Neymar’s claims became known in the Catalan capital, Barcelona filed a counterclaim.
Blue-granates insist that the bonus was relied on for the fulfillment of the entire contract - from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club believes that the player was entrusted with only a quarter of 40 million euros and demand the return of the proportional part of the first payment.
But the most interesting thing is that in the summer Neymar and "Bars" almost agreed on the return of the "prodigal" player in the womb of Catalonia.
True, the deal has broken down, but the hope of a reverse transition of the forward remains.
According to Sports.Ru, with reference to insiders, the club's lawyers told the player's representatives that if the issue of financial claims is not settled in pre-trial procedure, it will exclude the possibility of returning the Brazilian.
Neymar himself is so eager to return that he asked for guarantees that the Catalans would buy him back.

But Laar replied that the aim of the Reform Party was to get two seats on the Council of the Bank of Estonia - so that in addition to Jaanus Tamkivi, Andrés S<0xC3><0xB8>tt would also be on the Council.
On Tuesday, September 24, Riigikogu rejected Laar’s proposal to appoint new members of the Bank of Estonia’s board.

Mass riots on three
The “Moscow case” against the participants of the summer protests the further, the more noticeably it breaks down into separate fragments and loses its political fill.
Evidence of the very fact of "mass riots" cannot be verified, but in the absence of a political decision to put this case on the brakes, a weak evidence base would not necessarily lead to the removal of the charges.

Will phytoestrogens and phytoandrogens help prolong youth?
The topic of phytoandrogens is poorly studied.
The most famous is the pine pollen.
But phytoestrogens have been studied well and have a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risks of certain diseases associated with age (among them cardiovascular, some types of cancer).
Known sources of phytoestrogens are all legumes (the most popular is soy), hops, flax seeds.
However, many experts believe that such BADs cannot be a complete replacement for natural hormones.
It is not possible to exclude the possible harm from such supplements.
For example, against the background of their reception, the production of their own hormones can be reduced due to the fact that too many analogues enter the body from the outside.

In Russia, there are many popular assumptions by which people try to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
In the Hydrometeorological Center checked all the signs that supposedly work.
Meteorologists have come to the conclusion that only two of them can really be trusted, however, in the short-term.
As the scientific director of the Hydrometeorological Center of Russia Roman Wilfand said, if the sun is red at sunset, the next day will really be beautiful, as our ancestors noted.
If the sky is white, the next day it will rain.
The second working sign is based on birdwatching.
More often talk about snails, if they fly low, it is usually to the rain.
This is explained simply - when the humidity of the air is high, the mosquitoes wet wings and the birds are forced to fall to hunt for insects, writes TASS.
On different continents there are their own folk signs.

Russians have nothing to put off for retirement - V. Matvienko
Speaker of the Federation Council Valentina Matvienko believes that the Russians do not have enough savings to make the law on the guaranteed pension product in full force in the country.
The practice of increasing pensions at the expense of personal savings in the world is quite common.
It is a matter of timely introduction.
“In my opinion, a significant part of the population now has incomes, from which they simply have nothing to allocate to increase pensions in the future,” said Matvienko.
The Russians, according to the speaker, can not understand the mechanisms of formation and accrual of pensions, because "the constant changes in this area have finally confused them."
This does not mean that I am against improving the pension system that regulates its legislation.
“Russia is a social state, and we have to do everything in our power to improve the size of pensions and social security of citizens.
But steps in this direction should be thought-out, responsible, taking into account domestic realities," Matvienko told RIA Novosti.
The head of the SF stressed that if this initiative (the draft law on the guaranteed pension product) will develop, then it is necessary to provide for several basic principles, including voluntary, tax preferences for citizens and employers and strict guarantees and the responsibility of the state to ensure the preservation of pensions.
On September 6, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation announced the sending of a draft law on the guaranteed pension product (GPP).
Among its main elements - exclusively voluntary procedure of accession of citizens to the system of savings, guarantee of preservation of long-term pension savings of citizens by the state, registration of savings accounts of citizens by the central administrator, tax benefits for businesses and tax deductions for citizens.

So while Sony continues to develop its own Spidey universe, the future can bring unexpected surprises,” he said.
Tom Holland, who played Spider-Man in five films, apparently commenting on the news, posted on his Instagram account an excerpt from the film "The Wolf of Wall Street", in which the hero Leonardo di Caprio shouts "I'm not leaving!"

We’re happy to be able to move forward together.”

In Congress in the conversation of trump with Zelensky saw "Russian trace"
In the lower house of the US Congress, the Russian Federation was accused of involvement in the scandal caused by the telephone conversation of the head of the White House Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky.

The expert told why it is necessary to give up tea in bags
A group of scientists from Canada representing McGill University found that when brewing a tea bag into a cup in five minutes, more than ten billion microplastic particles get into it.
Particles of sawdust can also be added to the packaged drink, food safety expert Elizabeth Tikhonova said.
According to the agronomist, the consumer can not get reliable information about the composition of the packaged tea - the manufacturer can add there ingredients that will not be indicated on the packaging.
The sawdust is not thrown out at the end of the season, so they may end up in tea.
"Moreover, the bags do not always include tea plants," Tikhonova said.
According to her, it is better to abandon the use of such a drink in favor of tea for weight loss, which is sold in specialized stores.
In addition, she stressed that the danger of packaged tea lies not only in the composition, but also in the method of its production - the microparticles are heated to high temperatures, due to which they can begin to release harmful substances.
“It is best to buy pure green or black tea – such a drink will have the least additives,” said the expert.

Regions invited to share the secrets of business support
As it became known to the "Parliamentary Gazette", on September 27, the Chairman of the Committee of the Federation Council on Economic Policy Andrey Kutepov sent a letter to the Minister of Economic Development Maxim Oreshkin and the Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov with a proposal to express a position on the initiatives of the Federation subjects and to improve the law.
It is time to establish interregional relations
The Committee of the Federation Council on Economic Policy summarized the information received from the regions on the current programmes for business development and legalization of self-employed workers, as well as on the results of such programmes.
In their letters, the regions told the senators about the problems of the development of SMEs and sent proposals for the improvement of existing legislation.
"To date, communication between the regions is not sufficiently established, as a result of which the business community in all regions of the visit of senators has indicated the issue of lack of information about regional programs for the development of entrepreneurship in the country as a whole", - stated Andrey Kutepov.
In the annex to the letter addressed to the Government, he presented a summary of the positive developments of the regions on the legalization of self-employment and consolidated data from the regions with proposals and issues (available in the drafting).
In addition to specialized ministries, aggregate data from the regions are also sent to the heads of regional executive bodies.

The first step to such an exchange will be the transmission of information available to the Committee on Economic Policy," the senator told the Parliamentary Gazette.
Useful Experiences
Today, in many regions of the country, programs to support small and medium-sized businesses have been adopted and are successfully implemented.

Self-employed people continue to get out of the shadows
In the view of the regional authorities, a number of changes to the current legislation should be made in order to support small and medium-sized businesses more effectively.
For example, Arkhangelsk Oblast proposed to replace the term "self-employment" with "entrepreneurial activity", as this "most corresponds to the content of the public service to promote self-employment of unemployed citizens".
In the Ivanovo region, it is considered necessary to make amendments that provide for the expansion of the list of activities carried out by self-employed citizens, including activities for the decoration and repair of residential premises, cottage buildings, physical training classes.
Bryansk region considers it important to strengthen control of unscrupulous producers of dairy products with the help of the veterinary system "Mercury".
And in the Kostroma and Magadan regions, the concept of "social entrepreneurship" and directions of support for social entrepreneurship are encouraged to be consolidated in the normative and legal field.
All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state programmes to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills.
"All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state programs to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important ones will be developed in the form of specific bills," Kutepov assured.

The Russian government has estimated that the supply of agricultural products and food to Russia from countries that have fallen under the Russian food embargo has decreased by more than 100 times since 2013.
According to a report sent to Russian President Vladimir Putin, in the first half of 2019, 31 thousand tons of products were imported from sanctioned countries, compared to 3 million 442.2 thousand tons for the same period of 2013, Interfax reports.
At the same time, the value of imported products decreased to $226.5 million from $4 billion 975.5 million respectively.
We are talking about the supply of goods that did not fall under the embargo.
As indicated in the report, the dropped volumes of prohibited products were compensated by the increase in imports from CIS countries, Africa, South-East Asia, Serbia.
At the end of August, the government extended until December 31, 2020, the rules for the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and food, which are prohibited for import into Russia under counter-sanctions.
In a document posted on the official legal information portal, it was noted that the validity of the rules was extended by another one per year - from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020.
Initially, the decree on the abolition of the sanctions applied to products from the United States, the EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Later, since August 13, 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Ukraine have "joined" this list since January 1, 2016.
Putin’s decree on the destruction of illegally imported “sanctions” (products subject to a food embargo, which Moscow imposed in response to the anti-Russian sanctions of the West) entered into force in 2015.
In turn, the government authorized the destruction of “sanctioned” food in any legal way.
As Western sanctions continue, Russia has also extended its retaliatory measures.
At the same time, the measure does not apply to products that citizens import for personal use.
The prohibition does not apply to the import of goods for personal consumption weighing up to 5 kilograms.
However, the head of the Council under the President of the Russian Federation on the development of civil society and human rights Mikhail Fedotov previously called "simplely immoral" the destruction of food, and this, according to him, has a negative impact on the education of people.
Moreover, with the initiative to ban the destruction of food suitable for consumption, in early June, Rospotrebnadzor spoke.
A similar recommendation was made to the government by the Human Rights Council under the President of the Russian Federation.
And Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexey Gordeev said that destroying food is wrong, and you need to think about how you can use them for the purpose, assessing the quality.

By 2023, the first school of the new format will open in the center of the capital
The new school will be opened in Hamovniks.
According to the head of the Moskomstroyinvest Anastasia Pyatova, there will create all conditions for self-realization and development of children’s talents.
The educational institution decided to call it a "New Look".
This project will be supervised by the Moscow State Institute of International Relations of the Russian Foreign Ministry and the Foundation "Economic Development of Higher School".
The design of the building with an area of about 10,000 "squares" is planned to begin next year.
Construction will be completed at the end of 2022, and the first students will be recruited in the next year.
"The project provides for the creation of a public, non-commercial educational space, which will be based on the traditions of the classical Moscow school and experimental methods," the Moskomstroyinvest press service said.
In Chile, began to build a telescope worth 1 billion euros
This is reported by TASS with reference to the press service of the European Southern Observatory (ESO).
This week, the construction of the dome of the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT), the most expensive and ambitious ground-based astronomical project, has officially begun.
Its total cost, according to ESO estimates, will exceed <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 billion.
Most of this money will be spent on equipment and the construction of the observatory building.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its record large mirror, whose diameter will be about 39 meters.
It will be assembled from 798 hexagonal segments measuring 1.4 meters.
This huge mirror, as well as two auxiliary reflective surfaces with a diameter of 4.2 and 3.75 meters, will help the E-ELT get the first detailed pictures of planets outside the solar system, stars in other galaxies, and also look for Earth's twins.
In addition, scientists will try to use this observatory to observe the surroundings of Sgr A*, a supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way.
Despite the fact that the construction of the dome has only just begun, scientists, engineers and other specialists have been developing mirrors, scientific tools and other components of the observatory for three years - since the announcement of the first plans for the construction of the E-ELT.
The contract for the production of the main mirror, which totalled about 400 million euros, was awarded to the German firm SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc.
