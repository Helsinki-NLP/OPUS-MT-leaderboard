The Prague Stock Exchange crashes into a downturn against business closing.
After the steep fall in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
Transactions with <0xC4><0x8C>EZ’s shares reached almost half of normal day-to-day business.
The Prague Stock Exchange began trading on Tuesday at the beginning of Monday’s break-in, as it fell by another six percentage points.
This time, the reason was the Wall Street intrusion.
In the Czech Republic, too, the reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the U.S. House of Representatives, which had refused to support a stabilisation plan for the financial sector there.
Fall of stocks in Asia
A dramatic fall occurred on Tuesday in stocks on the Asian stock exchanges, although the indices were able to offset some of the losses over the course of the day.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Stock Exchange index lost almost four percentage points during the business day, but was later able to offset some of the losses, thus reducing the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which monitors the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell by 3.8 percent, while the markets in Shanghai were closed.
Shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but then reduced to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange fell by 3.6 percent, according to the index.
“The timing of rescue action in the United States is uncertain and will affect the financial markets worldwide,” said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.
Hong Kong, although it belongs to China, determines its monetary policy itself, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are moving at the same level as those in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, U.S. lawmakers should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and pass the bill to support the financial system.
Otherwise, there is a risk that other countries will be affected by the incursion.
A Bloodbath of American Stocks
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected the plan to support the financial system, for which up to 700 billion dollars (almost 12 trillion CZK) should be spent.
Legislators thus ignored President George Bush’s call to support the plan.
In Bush’s view, the plan would address the underlying causes of the financial crisis and thus help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and major stock indices saw the biggest burglary in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index fell by nearly seven percent, a similar slump it had last seen in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there was little indication that the draft would not pass in the House of Representatives, the index experienced a free fall.
Congress Makes Confession: US Government May Pump $700 Billion into Banks
The top representatives of the U.S. Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of agreement on financial assistance for the American financial system.
It is expected to be voted on early next week.
U.S. lawmakers reached a breakthrough in talks on adopting a rescue plan in the form of a $700 billion bailout for the U.S. financial system.
However, this does not yet signify a victory.
Congressmen have to negotiate some details of the agreement before they can publish the final version of the law and vote on it.
The plan to support the financial system will be negotiated in the US Congress on Monday.
On Sunday, the chairman of the Banking and Financial Services Committee, Barney Frank, told Reuters.
According to various reports, the plan could probably be voted on in the Senate by Wednesday at the earliest.
According to economists, a notification that the plan will be adopted should be the first significant psychological factor for a revival of the financial markets.
Afterwards, however, there is a "sensitization" due to the complicated mechanisms, how to help the markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our different views on what a package to stabilise the market should look like," Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, told Bloomberg.
According to him, there could be a final vote on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislature met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give the government fund its final form.
This envisages a purchase of non-sellable mortgage assets from financial corporations, which plunges financial firms into severe losses and jeopardizes the stability of the entire system.
“We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and must be effective in the market.
We have to continue the recovery plan even further, but I think we are on target," Paulson said.
A Signal for Asian Businesses
The global financial crisis is also striking in the stock markets, which are declining sharply.
According to the words of the Democratic Senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislators are trying to reach a final agreement before Sunday in Congress.
This is aimed at reassuring investors before trading on Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone, where a congressional decision could affect business on Monday.
So far, however, it is not entirely clear when both chambers of the US Congress will vote on the law, and there is uncertainty as to whether the last-minute negotiations could still fail on a problem.
Legislators hope that it will be passed in the next few days.
However, the law will undergo some changes.
The total amount earmarked for assistance to the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion should be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush has called for.
Congress, however, can block the disbursement of the remaining money if it has the impression that the program is not fulfilling its function, at another $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush Says Progress in Negotiations Positive
The President has a veto on this decision, but Congress can override his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program, which was based on obtaining finances for the purchase of bad mortgage securities whose value has fallen, has persisted because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
“We worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday, the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The US President Bush was also pleased with the progress.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was satisfied with Saturday’s progress and “appreciate the efforts of both sides to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Limitation of golden parachutes
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, the senior negotiator, said lawmakers had agreed on a responsibility for the monetary program, protecting taxpayers from losses, concluding concessions, and a timeline for financing the plan.
The new law also aims to limit the so-called golden parachutes for directors of the companies involved in the program and establishes a committee to oversee the fund.
This should be headed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We have worked very hard on this and made great progress towards an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also counts on help for homeowners who have trouble repaying their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new rates on mortgages it buys up, with the goal of lowering the monthly costs for debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
The proposed plan is a good idea, according to Patria Finance chief economist David Marek, but implementation will be very difficult.
“And that’s because you don’t know by what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets are purchased.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government share the losses with each other," Marek told iHNed.cz.
Whether the plan will be adopted now or early next week is not, in Marek's view, decisive.
“It is much more important that Congressmen agree to support the plan and that they adopt it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement that there will be an adoption is the most important thing at this moment," Marek stressed.
Duel on Messers Schneide: MP3 player against mobile phones.
We advise you on your choice
While almost any phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can still phone.
Therefore, of course, it looks like it is better to buy only one phone.
In spite of all this, there are plenty of reasons why you should hire an independent player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the claims of the future owners.
It’s hard to buy a great expensive record player at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc’s latest album.
Once such musical novelties do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for it either.
However, if you have LPs with art rock, jazz or blues on the shelf, you’re probably dreaming of at least one.
This is also simplified with music on travel, i.e. with compressed music - music in MP3 format.
There are also price and quality categories.
For one, it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a player, but a Pink Floyd fan will probably hardly be able to handle headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone.
The selection is wide-ranging.
The life of the batteries is also crucial.
Some good music players can play a lot more than just music, but what mobile phones can do is not even hint at.
No modern device can be used as universally as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, the phone call and the Sims, it can play music and videos, record both, it has a better, a worse camera, and maybe it can also navigate.
And if you still include the smartphones and communicators, you have almost a small computer in your pocket.
It’s a small miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no television can photograph.
But the universality of mobile phones also brings disadvantages.
However, the more features you use on your phone, the more often you will need to recharge it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy-consumers.
Few phones can play music for longer than ten to twelve hours, usually it is much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
That’s why you should expect cheap phones to be able to play music for no more than a few hours.
If you are still on the phone from time to time, buy a charger for the office - this also applies to more expensive devices.
With MP3 players, you won’t have this problem, even the less good ones will last at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation with one charge.
Another problem is if you want to overplay the music on your phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices has a USB port, and not every phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can play the music directly on a storage medium, but only a few card readers will be finished without reduction with the tiny memory cards that are used in mobile phones.
Players do not need any special software except for exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most mobile phones and players create a music library themselves, sorted by the name of the performer, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the rating by users.
Some devices only represent the tree structure of the address book, similar to the Windows Explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can do more
When selecting a specific device, you should inquire in particular about the battery life, the storage capacity, the quality and type of sound and, of course, the ease of use.
If music is especially for you and you listen to it every day just briefly, for example, in the tram, then any phone that plays MP3 files is enough.
What almost any cell phone can do.
You also don’t have to particularly control which music formats a mobile phone or player can handle.
MP3 create all, and most of the music you get will be in this format.
The format is one of the most common, and in addition, most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that Apple and its iPods use).
Better mobile phones also allow you to buy music online.
You only need to access the corresponding pages of a provider (or another provider) via the mobile internet, and you can already purchase a song or album.
In and of itself, this service can be a compelling argument for why you should buy a music handy.
Unfortunately, the provider’s offer is poor and is mostly limited to fast radio hits.
The prices are also not the lowest.
In general, however, it is assumed that this type of music sales (whether via GSM, Internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people carry the phone with them.
If you feel like listening to something, grab the phone in your jacket pocket while the player is at home.
However, it depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least a wireless hands-free device.
If not, you can rely on the built-in speaker that almost every phone has, but only the fewest MP3 players.
Probably the biggest advantage of music phones will be in the price for many.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns you will get a very decent walkman.
The biggest handicap for most people will be that they don’t have normal headphones.
The best and most technically mature phones with a 3.5mm aperture for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the player is in its easy operation.
The simplest - and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - player can really serve anyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity in operation with the earlier normal cassette recorder or, for example, the recorder is obvious.
There is no risk of a collision in the form of an erroneously employed mobile internet and a subsequent horrific bill for data transfers.
Which device should you grab?
Even the cheapest phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even if you repurchase a corresponding card, two thousand crowns are enough.
But be careful.
In the basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are usually supported.
Only the most expensive ones can also read 8GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, then go to Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (maximum 2 GB), you do not have to put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
Be one of the more demanding listeners, prefer to take specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some from Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have stand-alone MP3 control buttons, and the ease of use comes close to that of a single MP3 player.
The widest is Sony Ericsson, whose phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the individually sold MP3 players.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, maximum up to 35 hours) provide you with MP3 players from the above manufacturers.
The first virtual provider is coming to the Czech Republic this year.
MAYBE
The mobile telephony market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, with Czech providers offering virtually all services, as they are also offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classic at lower prices.
Maybe he won't be able to wait any longer.
We have often reported on Mobil.cz that the Czech mobile service providers are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was also confirmed by the Telecommunications Authority <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, which pointed out that the price of an SMS is higher here than in the rest of the European Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the area of regulation of roaming charges, it is so likely to be a paradoxical situation - for some customers of the Czech mobile service providers, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
Why are the prices in the Czech Republic so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, it lacks the competition that really makes a combat statement.
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, but in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of far more than 100%.
Mobile providers, on the other hand, like to reproach the fact that there is extremely much competition on the Czech market.
Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>k, Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>), who has often stated in the past that there is no room for another provider in the Czech Republic, is also obliged to do so.
It’s probably true that a classic provider with its own network doesn’t have a lot of chances anymore (by the way, he probably wouldn’t even find frequencies).
But there is one more possibility - a virtual provider.
It was precisely the entry of virtual providers into the mobile market that brought with it a significant price reduction, to which the classic mobile providers had to react.
Before companies such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the UK market, there were similar voices to those in the Czech Republic.
However, it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can really be successful.
By the way, you do not have to look for examples for long.
In February this year, we reported on the launch of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider managed to gain more than 100 thousand customers and thus become the fifth largest provider in the country.
Behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta, which owns, among other things, U:fon in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual providers is that you can focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to function effectively, virtual providers need far fewer customers than a classic provider.
You don’t need a relatively high cost to build, operate and maintain a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers typically profile themselves as low-cost companies - they offer cheap phone calls and SMS, which is often accompanied by a less extensive range of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be quite a good move to put on a non-cliché target group.
This provider is specifically aimed at men.
"Real guys choose mobilking - the provider they like and can trust," said David Seibert, CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept as in Poland could also be adopted in the Czech Republic.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> also doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the service offer."
In the Czech Republic no chance, the mobile service providers think
However, it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile service provider conquers the Czech Republic, it will not be mobilking.
"We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look particularly hopeful.
Mobilking is more likely to enter the market in other countries in our region," said Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, a spokeswoman for the financial group Penta, in a telephone interview with Mobil.cz.
It indirectly confirmed that the current mobile service providers in the Czech Republic are not particularly inclined to this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything to ensure that no potential competitor arises.
For a long time now, the GTS Novera Group has shown its interest in launching a virtual mobile service provider, which wants to take another step towards becoming a real competitor of Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
“We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed network, but also mobile telecom services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile service providers.
With some of them, we have already made progress in negotiations,” said Group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
Maybe there will be better times now.
Unofficial information suggests that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
But so far this is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
"At this point, we do not assume that there is room for a full-fledged virtual provider in the Czech Republic.
The Czech market is very specific to other markets.
So far, no subject has approached us with a complex and serious project in this area," says Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88> from the Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica O2 press department in his statement to Mobil.cz.
Other providers also point out the specifics of the Czech market.
T-Mobile press secretary Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> rarely agrees with O2’s statement: “So far, we have not found a viable and mutually beneficial project to build on.”
And she adds, “T-Mobile’s network will scarcely have a virtual provider coming up by the end of the year.
At this point, we would have to have a concrete offer in order to be able to think in such a short term.”
Vodafone pays more attention to meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> says: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual providers, especially in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure.
This is precisely what we consider to be the best from the point of view of our customers.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile internet.”
The responsible authorities - with the providers hand in hand
The behaviour of the mobile operators is easy to understand, another provider is called more competition, this would lead to falling prices and thus also to a decrease in profits.
So why should we make it easier for such a competitor to enter the market?
The fact that the providers can pull on a string when it comes to something, also proves the long hindsight of the creation of U:fon.
The strongest pressure towards <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> was probably from the company T-Mobile when U:fon came on the market.
This is also evidenced by publicly available information from the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> websites.
But now U:fon is suitable as an argument as to why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> commented: “The competitive environment of the mobile market has also recently been strengthened by the market entry of a fourth mobile provider.
Taking into account the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player would place high demands on the market itself and, above all, on its services."
In view of this approach, however, the Czech regulators are surprised by the absolute lack of interest.
This is not only about the attitude of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, which, unfortunately, in the Czech Republic - unlike the United Kingdom and other highly developed countries - does not have the competence to interfere in economic competition.
It is owned exclusively by the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS).
This, however, had to do with his very typical attitude to this whole issue.
"The market entry of a virtual mobile service provider would then be possible after a contract has been concluded between a mobile service provider and a virtual service provider on the lease of the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contract has been concluded, because the offer of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for the classical providers," says in his response to our request Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa from the Department of External Relations of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
Representatives of the providers would not be surprised by such a formulation.
This is more than questionable from an authority that represents the interests of consumers and, among other things, ensures that no one abuses their position in the market.
In particular, when Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa adds: "Abroad, where virtual providers work quite normally, it is to be observed that their market entry has contributed to a price reduction in mobile phone services."
Probably, however, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a price reduction are not in the interests of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
What is really shocking in this case is the almost touching agreement of the three mobile operators, which results from their reactions.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence is obvious.
Just as the exact same gasoline price at the gas stations is surely just a coincidence and the result of a tough competition.
"The Authority has not found any evidence in this matter that indicates an anti-competitive action, and therefore has no reason to intervene in the matter in any way.
None of the providers has a dominant market position, so they also do not have the corresponding increased responsibility for their actions on the market.
The necessary tools for opening up the mobile market for virtual providers are probably also missing from the telecoms regulator," Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of many contentious points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, drawn up by <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, according to which telecommunications is a single market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile service providers has a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different perspective - for a virtual provider to enter the market, the consent of the network operator is always necessary.
And the mobile service provider has - logically - the monopoly for its network.
This means that it necessarily occupies a dominant position in a particular segment.
However, even if one does not agree with this argument, it should at least be a warning to the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS that three mobile service providers act strikingly similarly.
In doing so, complaints from a number of interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles in negotiations with all suppliers.
The discharge of responsibility to the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> is then a rather usual trick in the telecommunications services, with which the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS distances itself from the whole matter.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recent amendment to the Telecommunications Act failed to enact the extension of <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>'s competences to the field of economic competition in telecommunications, even though a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS only need to know this too well, but they probably have other interests.
It's okay when no one's looking
First of all, the functioning of any pseudo-virtual provider, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
It is companies that issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, which are, however, only partly public.
These are usually companies that operate in the field of multi-level marketing.
Own mobile phone services provide for example Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach selectees.
The joke of the matter is that the company appears to the operator as a classic corporate customer who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he then receives special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile service providers prohibit similar resale.
"If there are cases that you describe, then it may be a violation of the contractual terms that we will then deal with, which may lead to the termination of cooperation with the relevant company," Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> replied to our question on this issue.
However, it is quite unlikely that such a thing is not being discussed with the responsible mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned, it can be thousands of customers.
However, no operator opposes such an approach.
In fact, they do not receive negligible profits from the activities of these companies, but at the same time - unlike the actual virtual providers - they are not affected by the actual official marketing.
On possible problems, Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> points out: "The law allows for such types of speculation, despite everything, the services of these companies are used only by a very small percentage of customers.
They also have to accept that the SIM card in their phone does not run on their name, so they cannot have full access to it like the normal customers of the mobile service providers.
That alone, however, would have to be at least strange.
In addition, another question opens up for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
Do mobile providers close their eyes to such an action, why do they lock themselves against a virtual provider?
It should be added that the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has quite strong competences to detect such activities, and if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the declaration of the providers, they would know nothing about it and their terms and conditions would prohibit this.
When the Czech Republic is No Longer the Most Expensive
As has already been stressed several times in the text, the market entry of virtual providers brought with it a significant decrease in prices for the various services.
In virtually all countries where virtual providers have emerged, the classical providers have tried to prevent their emergence practically more or less.
The arguments used by them were virtually identical - a market that was too small or too saturated, problems in the quality of services, etc.
In the highly developed countries, however, the regulators intervened in these moments, which in no way tried to protect the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers.
Whether through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator was created, and this was followed by more.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are throwing themselves in the whole case like a hot potato.
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that ambiguity in the competencies in these cases is more than favorable.
But let's not throw the flint in the grain.
If the background information is correct and a virtual provider appears soon, the Czech mobile market may soon start moving again.
If a provider allows the creation of a virtual mobile service provider, the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS will not remain inactive when it comes to rejecting (discriminating) other interested parties.
And the Czechs will finally not be more expensive to call than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek presented the new recordings of the national anthem Wo ist mein Heimatland on the occasion of the day of Czech statehood in a festive hour.
The anthem was re-recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo singing, in choral version and in an instrumental version.
The vocal version was taken over by Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>nkov<0xC3><0xA1> and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the hymn versions are Otakar Jeremi<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
On the server iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions at the same time.
For B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek, the Czech national anthem is one of the most beautiful.
Earlier, he had told Czech Radio that he had chosen singers with young, representative voices that are distinctive and popular for the solo variants.
"From the beginning, I tried with both and then with the choir to adhere to a clear diction, so that one understands the text well, so that a harmony is created," says the conductor.
The Czech national anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov m<0xC3><0xBD>j was first sung in 1834 on the stage of the Stand Theatre in the original Czech play Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka by Josef Kajet<0xC3><0xA1>n Tyl, the music originated by Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroup.
It became popular, and people accepted it spontaneously.
The first verse of the song then became an organic part of the national anthem after the formation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
It remained one of the seven state symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
What is the "new" hymn
The Prague transport companies will also be transporting a chip for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, will enter the history of Prague’s transport companies as a date on which the first passengers who carry an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket board board a subway, tram or bus.
These can currently be purchased by about one hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase a 30-day, 90-day or yearly coupon (valid from 1 January 2009) and have it played on their chip card at the same time, in the information centers and branches of the transport companies at the subway stations Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, N<0xC3><0xA1>dra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD> Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, And<0xC4><0x9B>l, Roztylisby, Let
Since yesterday, the coupons are also available via the Internet on the pages of the transport companies www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by over four hundred customers until the afternoon hours.
Those who use the internet sale can really forget the issue window in the subway stations, where they have had to wait regularly in long lines for their paper tickets.
You buy the coupon via the Internet, it is played on the Opencard in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"At these points, there is also a switch with trained staff at the disposal of the travellers, which advises those interested in buying online and also plays the coupon on the map," says project spokesman Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>.
In addition to the libraries, you can also play the electronic coupons on self-service machines on the Opencard, which are installed in some metro vestibules.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, reminiscent of ticket depreciators, passengers may have noticed them already in the subway stations Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovick<0xC3><0xA1>, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavsk<0xC3><0xA1>.
"There are currently five of them in the city, but by the end of the year it should be eighty," adds Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>.
The coupon is controlled by an automatic instead of the driver
The operation of the machines that will work from tomorrow is simple.
All you have to do is insert the chip card and the previously purchased coupon will play by itself.
The electronic coupons will apply from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surrounding area.
So in the suburban trains and on the bus lines with numbers 300 to 499, with which mainly the inhabitants from municipalities of the Central Bohemian region get to the capital.
"In the trains that are part of integrated transport in Prague, the train attendants have reading devices with which they can check the validity of the coupons by time and zone," Filip Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal of the organization Ropid explains the ticket control. This organization compiles the timetables for the Prague transport companies.
The suburban buses have card readers at the cash desk with the driver.
When entering, the chip card must not only be presented to the driver, but the open card must be placed at a marked place on the side of the checkout.
In this way, the driver checks the validity of the replayed coupons.
“If a passenger wants to check the validity of the replayed coupons, nothing is easier than asking the driver for this information,” Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal said.
A passenger who does not travel on suburban buses and no longer knows when the validity of the coupon ends, can go to the self-service vending machines, where the coupons are played on the card.
This displays the information about the validity of your documents on the display of the device.
The Sudeten demanded a referendum from the United States.
The Sudeten Germans had requested the annexation of the Bohemian Forest to the United States in 1945.
This is evident from a letter that is stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With such a wish, some groups of Sudeten Germans were said to have turned to the US president in 1945.
This is evidenced, among other things, by a letter that has been preserved in a private archive and is now kept in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans of Krumau in the letter ask the American president not to allow the return of the "Sudetengaus" - which was taken on the basis of the Munich agreement by Hitler - to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and we really want to be sure of the words that the American units do not enter German territory as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," the letter reads.
Since the connection to Czechoslovakia suggests that the Sudeten Germans - in the knowledge of the Czech national character - would expect brutality, recklessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take over the patronage for today and forever.
"We cannot believe that regardless of the view of a quarter of a million inhabitants of this area, you are addressing a state that is foreign to us, that is oppressing and trying to eliminate minorities, and that nothing has contributed to the victory of the Allies," the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is supposedly the fear of revenge desires of the "Czech oppressors".
If the US President has doubts about the attitude of the Bohemian Forest Germans, it would be sufficient if he would initiate a popular decision in the Bohemian Forest to decide whether the inhabitants would become part of the United States or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound somewhat na<0xC3><0xAF>ve in today's knowledge of post-war history, according to some contemporary witnesses, it paints a good picture of the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at that time.
Although the Bohemian Germans at least had to guess that their expulsion from the Republic would be negotiated, few of them admitted such an opportunity at all.
Some expected that the United States and Britain would negotiate some kind of autonomy for the Sudetenland.
Again, others believed that they could simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis.
He was employed in the war as a Budweiser German by the navy at the Baltic Sea.
When he came into British captivity at the end of the war and was taken to a prisoner of war camp in Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that if they came home, they would get the Czech," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners of war who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war, in his opinion, expected that he would be expelled from the republic on the basis of the Bene<0xC5><0xA1> decrees.
Don't you think - then pay!
An emotionally charged campaign is aimed at motorists
Most expensive action for safety on the streets in Czech history.
This would also characterize the emotionally charged media campaign that the Ministry of Transport wants to launch on Wednesday.
Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek’s office promises to deter drivers from dangerous behaviour behind the wheel.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on television, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on flyers.
It is supposed to take the driver off of too fast driving and alcohol at the wheel.
And they also remember dressing up before the start of the ride.
The campaign wants to speak to young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional motorists.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
This is evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
Don't you think - then pay!
The words "do not think" are in capital letters on a license plate.
And then in a blood clot, the word "pay."
This means that you can pay a moment of inattention to your own life.
The spots will "shock" viewers until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can normally see images with drastic images of accident victims.
It promises that the number of accidents and the number of traffic deaths on Czech roads will fall.
The spots were compiled by the agency Euro RSCG.
Sugar bread and whips for the drivers
“For the drivers, the motto is sugar bread and whipping.
Sugar bread means that when you drive in red, for example, you save time.
The whip is then the threat of punishment or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," said Na Homolce Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n, a traffic psychologist at the hospital.
And that is why information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising are necessary, says the psychologist.
Even less effective, in his opinion, are signs that alert drivers to a danger.
"If you put up a static sign that warns of a danger, it will probably soon flow with the environment, and the drivers will no longer perceive it," says Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The chairman of the provisional Israeli government, Ehud Olmert, has spoken out for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, if peace can be concluded with Palestine and Syria in return.
This he emphasized in an interview printed by the daily newspaper Jediot Achronot on Monday.
"We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all, if not all, of the (occupied) areas," Olmert told the newspaper.
“We will keep a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to hand over a similarly high percentage to the Palestinians, because without this there will be no peace,” he added.
He admitted that a possible return would also include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and above all does not want tractors or bulldozers to roll over his legs, as has happened to one of my best friends, will have to renounce a part of Jerusalem," Olmert said, referring to two attacks in the city in July that killed several people and injured dozens of people.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the temple dwellers and sacred and historical places" located on the territory of the old town.
“He who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won’t work,” he continued.
Exit from the Golan Heights
Olmert called for a withdrawal of Israel from the Golan Heights, which he believes is an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
“My proposal is not to conclude peace with Syria solely on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights,” Olmert said.
“The Syrians know too well what they need to do to get the Golan Heights back.
They will have to renounce their current relationship with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with the (Shiite) Hezbollah movement; they will have to renounce the constant support they give to the terrorism of the (Shiite) Hamas movement, the Al-Qaida terror network and the Jihad (Holy War) Ministers in Iraq.
Questions after the accident: Are stewards on the bus illegal?
The law does not know them, in a long-distance bus is not allowed to run around
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus of the company Student Agency near the Italian Padua, the question arises whether stewards and passengers are allowed to run in and out of the bus during the trip.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of a steward is contrary to the law on road traffic," said the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The accident, which killed a twenty-two-year-old stewardess last week, was probably caused by the driver of the truck crossing the bus.
The young woman was sitting at that moment, to all the misfortune, next to the driver, in the least safe place in the car, although she had two more places available.
However, a bus can also have an accident or brake sharply when the steward carries coffee or newspapers.
It also plays a role whether the bus is equipped with parking spaces according to the vehicle letter.
If this is not provided in the bus, the passengers must sit.
Student Agency’s long-distance buses have no parking spaces; this was confirmed by the company’s director, Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, to Aktualj.cz.
"We discussed this with the ministry, and this did not initially agree with the movement of travelers.
Later this was withdrawn, and we reached a consensus that travelers may go to the toilet during the ride if they have their seat,” he said.
The law does not know a steward.
“There is no clear legal interpretation for the role of a steward – no legal regulation describes that role.
However, there is also no legislation prohibiting the carrier from providing services.
The law on road traffic only knows the term vehicle companions; however, its rights and obligations do not define it," adds the spokesman of the Ministry Hanzelka clearly.
Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport, on the other hand, believes that the law subsequently covers this issue.
"It depends on whether the bus also has parking spaces in the product approval.
That’s all,” he emphasizes.
Buses are divided into city buses, where there are parking spaces and the maximum speed is limited, public transport buses with parking spaces and a higher allowed speed, and long-distance buses without parking spaces with the highest allowed speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
As in the plane, says the expert
BESIP traffic safety expert Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n sees no fundamental problem in the movement of stewards on board a bus.
"With a liquid mode of travel, there are not many dangers, the situation is comparable to the service on board an aircraft.
Here, too, is not sure when turbulence will come, and the stewardess can shake her head."
"But if a bus brakes sharply, then of course the laws of physics also apply.
Just like on a city bus or a tram.
The safety of the stewards must be clarified by the carrier through internal regulations," he says and also believes that this problem is not completely solved from the point of view of the law.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is ready to delete the services
Student Agency is the only bus company that offers services from Stewards.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
The director does not consider his profession to be risky even after the accident.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the steward's profession is risky, I will remove him.
Coffee and newspapers can be received by travellers upon boarding.
It would also reduce costs,” he said.
As an interest in safety, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin justifies the lack of stewards in his bus, but his company only operates a fraction of the lines compared to Student Agency.
“We don’t have stewardesses, but we’ve been defending ourselves from the beginning.
Sooner or later, this ends with some fatal accident," he told T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz less than a year ago.
It was an incredible tragedy.
A young stewardess from the Pilsen region, who had worked for the company for two years, was injured in a bus accident to Naples.
The Slovenian truck was probably bent off the stand without blinking and had blocked the bus from driving.
The driver of the bus tried to escape by a sharp maneuver, but collided with the right front with the truck.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura disputes that the two seats had been sold to the stewards.
"These places cannot be reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
The company wants to sue truck drivers.
With compensation for the young woman’s family, the agency will not wait for the court judgment, but it expects financial compensation from the culprit.
A law change?
Not in sight
A more precise regulation of the movement of stewards on board a bus could bring about a statutory regulation on which a thirty-member team of experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for over a year.
“But this has not yet come to a concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the points system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones when driving," says specialist Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the stewards as something that could significantly jeopardize the safety of the passengers," said Hanzelka, with the control of the safety of the buses being the responsibility of the police and the occupational safety authorities.
Düsseldorf hopes rest on Frankfurt
There is no shortage of big words in the letter from the WestLB Board of Directors to the employees of the house.
The merger of units of the Düsseldorf-based financial institution with the Frankfurt-based Deka-Bank could create "the central capital market house of the savings banks financial group", the letter said.
WestLB introduced a "competence block" with sustainable profitability into such a business.
And in general, such a connection could be the decisive impetus for further mergers in the state banking sector.
This is how it is read if a board wants to demonstrate ability to act in difficult times.
Because the attacked WestLB is still under tremendous pressure.
Not only on the part of the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Institute for Financial Services Supervision, which has only recently made it clear to the North Rhine-Westphalia state government that the time is urgent to find a future solution.
The connection between the Deka-Bank, which is known to savings bank customers because of its investment funds, and the WestLB has been the subject of discussion for some time now - also on the Frankfurt side.
Deka-Bank-Chef Franz Waas, when presenting the half-yearly figures at the end of August, did not make sense in a merger of the house on the Mainzer Landstraße with a Landesbank, for example the Helaba or the WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, which is each responsible for half of the state banks and savings banks associations, has instructed the Management Board to conduct discussions with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be the capital market business or parts of it.
Of course, the talks have only just begun, it is said at the financial center.
The Deka-Bank, which with its 3,000 employees is one of the most important employers on the Frankfurt financial center, is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the savings banks sector.
In 2003, it seemed for a moment that the Deka Bank could merge with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
However, nothing happened from this trio.
As soon as the plans had become public, the Hessian state government opposed the participation of the Helaba.
The other two houses did not find each other either.
The Landesbank Rhineland-Palatinate instead went to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, there have always been games of thought about a connection of the deka-bank with state banks.
Recently, however, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Board of Helaba, had spoken out against planning games about a meeting with his house.
Regardless of this, however, the realization seems to be ripe that bringing the various houses of the public sector together is a necessity.
Now that the Landtag election in Bavaria is over, a connection between BayernLB and the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could be the first to come closer.
This is not necessarily good news for the Helaba.
Should the pressure for further mergers increase, the partners gradually assume it.
In the south, she would only be a junior partner, although she has so far endured the financial crisis much better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
In a merger with West LB, the Hessen-Thüringen Sparkassen- und Giroverband, which has an 85 percent stake in Helaba, pushed a lock at the beginning of the year.
It's the North LB.
However, such geostrategic considerations are only one side.
On the other hand, it is about the question of how the different business models of the individual houses fit together.
In June, Merl stated that the crucial question with which business model the future capacity of the Landesbanks should be ensured has not yet been answered by the Deutsche Sparkassen- und Giroverband.
In the end, there could also be a dismantling of West LB, which, of course, is not desirable there.
This is why the letter of the local board of directors also mentions that a "total solution" for the house is definitely being sought.
How this can be brought under a hat by the merging of individual units with the deka bank will still be shown.
The second Christmas weekend is known as the "Italian weekend"
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca, for the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is there as his girlfriend, and everything is different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-liter beer barrel of the Kaiser brand, stands a massively built bearded man and proves to the approximately 200 Oktoberfest travelers, what deep tones his throat can produce.
Elena gives Luca first a slap, then a kiss.
From Bologna they came to Verona.
From here, the bus parking lot next to Puorta Nuova station, four buses, "destinazione Monaco, festa della berra", will start this evening at 11.45 pm, arrival is expected at 6.30 pm.
Three buses are mainly reserved for Italians, in one bus only Brazilians travel.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans are already singing next to their flag, they have already celebrated at night.
And so loudly, Marco Guarda says, that's nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with velvet lining and glasses with wide silver irons, belongs to the buses.
For five years they have been driving to the Oktoberfest, three tours are this year alone.
At night, during the day on the meadow, back at 10:30 p.m.
Staying overnight would only mean unnecessary expenses, Marco says.
The trip costs 75 euros, the welcome drink with Kaiser-Bier, brewed faithfully to the Bavarian law of purity, the health insurance and the German-speaking travel guide - Marco has attended a language course in Frankfurt - included.
And already the buses roll into the night, on the motorway towards "Brennero".
There's no beer, not yet.
Soon it will be quiet in the bus, the travelers sleep.
All right, they're gonna need their powers.
It is held in Brixen and in Holzkirchen, where several other buses with Italian license plates at Highway 8 take a break just before Munich.
When Marco’s group finally arrives at the parking lot near the Theresienwiese at half past seven o’clock in the morning, there are already 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds a final address, explains the plan of attack.
First, put on the yellow cap.
On the left is "Oktoberfest", in fracture, next to the Internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Secondly, "When the doors to the beer tent open, it's called running!", Marco calls in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats in the back of the tent.
"Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all yellow hats on the same benches, spread in the room!"
The measurement, roaring Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the tip.
"To the security people, show that we are behaving well!
As soon as you leave the places, they are gone!”
Third, "Tonight, find point half past eleven again here!" Do you understand?
And we're going to Wiesn.
Along the way, a yellow cap binds as roadmarks to the trees, to signs and even to the election poster of a large Bavarian People’s Party.
They want to be ready for retreat.
It is the second weekend known as the "Italian weekend".
There are no exact figures; the talk is of 50,000 who are on their way across the Alps and entering the beer tents, ten percent of all visitors are said to have arrived extra from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which runs a national statistics in which the Italians take the first place in front of the British (about 60 operations) and Austrians (about 80) with about 200 medical supplies.
Especially popular with Italians is the Hofbräuzelt.
Sleepless nights for creditors of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed only last week.
How good that the politician used the word "relatively" and also inferred that the German banking sector will not be spared from the crisis developments.
Because it happened this weekend.
The Munich-listed real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE) receives a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to shield itself from the turbulence in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loans amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate only has to interest the part that it also uses.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
The background is losses to the daughter Depfa.
According to a newspaper report, the state financier had refinanced himself for long-term projects, for which he has provided money, extremely short-term - which is no longer possible due to the mistrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s cash reserve had shrunk by 95 per cent to 2.37 million euros, and the equity ratio had declined slightly from 1.6 per cent to 1.45%.
On-going earnings and net income from financial transactions fell to zero compared to the prior-year period, while earnings from write-downs on receivables and certain securities, as well as from the dissolution of provisions in the credit business, fell by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to higher returns from reimbursements of downstream offsetting costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group, as well as from the reimbursement of interest according to the tax regulations and from the business provision for group companies, the earnings minus had still dropped by around 16 percent moderately.
After its privatisation in 1990, the former state financier had initially speculated on commercial real estate loans, which had then been disbursed to Aareal Bank.
Due to the low level of earnings in classical state funding, Depfa had become increasingly involved in infrastructure projects and the financing of joint projects of private investors and the state (private public partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
On the value of the subsidiary, the Hypo Real Estate must now depreciate, which will have a "substantial material effect" on the profit and loss account of the group, it is quite uncertain.
The fact is that the dividend has been cancelled.
By 2007, it had been cut by two-thirds.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major state and infrastructure financier since the Depfa acquisition.
It is more dependent than other institutions on refinancing in the interbank market as it has no customer deposits.
With the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending among banks has again largely failed as the banks hoarded their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term funds to refinance a part of Depfa’s credit portfolio – around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 billion – annually.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the group’s financing needs are met with the loan for the foreseeable future and the company is shielded “from the impact of the currently largely inoperable international money markets”.
Other sources suggest that refinancing will be secured by the end of 2009 thanks to the funds.
HRE Chairman Georg Funke, on the other hand, said that the Hypo Real Estate Group will no longer have to take advantage of the money markets for the foreseeable future.
The Bundesbank and the Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin) assume that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured.
This is for shareholders and creditors of the bank to hope.
But given the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even inconceivable that funding does not have to be used in full.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out either.
After the late Sunday night hearing after the bank was still before the insolvency, even the at least provisional bailout is not able to calm the minds.
The share price drops by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the other hand, the bond prices are quite good.
If the primary debts show little movement, the rates of subordinated bonds yield more clearly.
In particular, the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, understandably, the maturity beyond 2009 are affected.
While hypo-real-estate bonds seem to be a speculative investment alternative in the past, their value must be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system after the sharply worsening of the banking crisis and the institution itself, which had only brought the crisis into its own hands with the takeover of Depfa.
As long as the central banks, governments and less crowded commercial banks are still ready to support the system, as long as a timely recovery of pensions can be assumed.
Or it comes down to what hardly anyone dares to hope at the moment - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports overlapping with partial nationalisation, the bordering probability of security has at present become only a legitimate hope.
This is likely to prepare long-term creditors for some sleepless nights with the decision of whether to separate from their commitments.
Short-term investors can use a closing line to make a loss statement for future repayment tax payments on price gains in later years.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Bento Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is supposed to introduce herself on the first day of school at Tachibana High School, the girls start to squeak: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from mangas - in the new exchange log she tells about Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
Even before school, I had a bum.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and travel 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, fortunately I did not run away.
The start of classes at the Tachibana does not seem to be as strictly defined as at our home in Lower Saxony.
The students trump from eight o'clock until twenty-nine a short round of discussion begins with the teacher, the 'home room'.
But before the class started, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I’m not the kind of person who likes to talk in front of people, not even in front of a class of 40 students.
Because I didn’t have a school uniform yet, I wore my host mother’s old skirt, plus blouse, blue knee socks and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator I stood in front of the counter and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and I have a birthday in a week.
At that moment I was very happy that I had already started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all hugged, hugged and waved, and all the time I heard the word "kawaii."
I knew that from my manga.
It belongs to the survival vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'nice, sweet'.
Then I quickly came to my place.
The girl next to me grinned quite broadly, she found it an honor that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was pretty quiet, but when the gong sounded, I was really stunned.
Everyone was chatting and chuckling and asking me for holes in my belly - it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
In the break, all their bentos were taken out.
My host mother had also made me a lunchbox - this is something different than the desolate German break breads.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, salad of cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in the tofu mantel.
Most of the time I don’t have a faint glimmer of what I eat here in Japan.
Things look strange and they taste completely new.
It is true that everything is really delicious.
Well, except for the salty plums, maybe, brrr!
Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a boy a self-made Bento, which she then makes especially artistically - in the hope of getting to know the boy more closely at the break snack.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I wonder if I can watch this, too.
‘Why Japan?’ my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said,
“Because it fascinates me.”
I have been reading manga for years now.
And in order for me to understand the comics and the culture in them better, I also started to learn a little Japanese.
So it was clear to me that I had to travel here at some point.
Because I also have a weakness for tradition, customs and customs.
And they place great importance on that.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I haven’t felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen.”
Rats also have feelings.
Does a rat or a scab run away when in danger, which means that it also feels fear?
The neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
Just how could you check if they feel the same if they behave similarly to us?
For several years, contributions of famous scientists have been published in the Internet magazine "Edge".
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove this so far where we can’t even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, since all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and intersect with questions of sensation or consciousness in general, we enter impassable terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat becomes endangered, it does the same thing as many other animals: it poses dead, flees or attacks.
Humans behave similarly, from which some scientists conclude a comparable subjective experience.
I don't believe that, though.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its involvement in short-term memory and execution/control functions).
This broad region is much more developed in humans than in the other primates and seems to be completely absent in other creatures.
So at least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including knowing who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity may lie in the linguistic nature of man: since so much of his experience is connected with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness did not depend on language, it would certainly influence it, so that animal consciousness, whatever it may be, is probably very different from most of our states of consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness may look like in other animals.
If, as something internal and subjective, it is neither measured nor, because of the special hardware, can be analyzed on the basis of our own experience, then his research presents us with great problems.
Most of my statements relate to the content of the conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be scientifically easier to access.
One could examine the consciousness processes of animals without regard to their contents, and this is exactly what happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially on the example of visualization.
But in this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, one shifts to the neural correlates of consciousness rather than to the causal mechanisms: both may or may not be identical.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the state of visualization.
What happens to the sensations?
I refer them to the fact that an emotional system like fear is activated in one of its own conscious brain activity.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the immune system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) occupies memory.
In this way, sensations are closely linked to the regions of the cortex that distinguish primates and in particular humans.
Associated with linguistic nature, fine degrees of sensation result, because with the help of words and grammar, we can differentiate and categorize states in order to attribute them to others in addition to ourselves.
Antonio Damasio, on the other hand, believes that sensations from more primitive activities in the body’s sensation regions of the cortex and brain stem are similar to Jaak Pankseep, who, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it may well be involved in intergenerational sensations.
Purely theoretically, I cannot contradict this, but I consider it to be unproven.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be fear in rats and humans probably feels the same in both cases: but how can one check whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave similarly?
Does a scab run away in danger if it also feels fear?
In my eyes, mere behavioral similarity cannot yet prove equality of experience.
Although the neural comparison helps further: rats and humans have similar brain stems, scabs do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
And even if you could prove it to humans: how did you want to prove it in rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, maybe even scabs (who knows?), have sensations.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are probably fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I’d rather explore emotional behavior than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, there is progress on the neural level, provided that the same is measured in rats and humans.
Just as I do not explore language and consciousness in rats, so I do not explore sensations, I do not know whether they exist.
You might think this is short-sighted, but I’d rather move forward than constantly running against a wall.
I am a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said that the preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees the decision of UEFA in Bordeaux as evidence of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to host the European Championship together with Poland," Wasjunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still a lot of work to be done in both countries."
The two hosts are lagging behind in the schedule for the construction or conversion of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
It may even be possible to reduce the number of EM stadiums from eight to six.
“We can’t waste any more time.
We must now work at maximum speed," said Grigory Surkis, president of the Ukrainian Federation.
“Uefa will keep an eye on us all the time.”
An even more radical step was decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish association PZPN has been suspended after numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the request of Minister of Sport Miroslav Drzewiecki.
There was "the serious danger that the PZPN is not able to act according to the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured UEFA President Michel Platini in a letter that preparations for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer from it."
Several first-team players had been sentenced to forced retirement for manipulation alone last season, after all, even the league start had to be postponed in the short term.
Indignant Dennis Quaid strikes back
She wanted to promote a new film, talked about privates in an interview - and now has trouble with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan outeted her late Dennis Quaid as an adulterer.
He foams and hits back.
Ex-husband Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors now have an unwelcome fight with each other - in public.
In an interview with the US magazine InStyle last week, Meg Ryan first spoke about the reasons for the failure of the marriage: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
The extent of the fraud they experienced only after the divorce.
The occasion for the soul striptease was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - the story of a adultery is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband was clear: "It's amazing," the 54-year-old told the New York Daily News, "Meg is resold and rewritten the history of our relationship for the most part."
It is also "regrettable" that the joint 16-year-old son Jack is once again "publicly reminded of the pain and upheavals that mean a divorce for every child."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently fathered twins.
And so conclude his admissions with the pageant: "My life goes on anyway.
I’m happy to have a wonderful family that is doing well.”
Decrease in prices for air tickets and hotels
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights have become up to 50% cheaper, according to a recent study.
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have become cheaper again - this is the result of a study by travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company has analysed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and after a rise in prices in the first quarter found a significant drop in the second quarter.
After the prices on the hotel market have risen for years, the overnight stays in many places have already become cheaper.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed increased by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The most obvious trend was in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
As a reason, American Express sees the weak dollar exchange rate, which has led to a “declining travel appetite of American tourists”.
Financial locations such as Frankfurt or London are also more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial locations such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices even hold the record in Europe with an increase of 26.3 percent.
In the first quarter, the trend also showed upwards in terms of flight prices:
Due to the kerosene overhaul, travellers in the economy had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, while long-haul fuel-intensive flights were up to 29.2 percent more expensive.
From April to June, prices for economy-class airline tickets fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but the price changes in the business and first-class were much smaller.
In Germany, prices fell even more sharply than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9 percent, while in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 percent.
On German domestic flights, prices have even halved, according to the study.
On the one hand, the reason for the price collapse is the declining economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the airline travel market is crumbling.
On the other hand, the Open Skies Agreement, which liberalises air traffic between the US and Europe, gives rise to increased competitive pressure.
Signs of the tense situation were the cancellation of unprofitable routes with airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that had filed for bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - in Europe alone, these were 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods, the Hamburger SV becomes the table leader.
At Borussia, Luhukay still fails to find a functioning elf.
By Kristoffer Klein increase breakout landing for national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher came into the game late and failed with a lift to the lattice.
His message was precisely worded, it persuasively went over his lips.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need the second gate," Hermann Rieger said in the lobby of the Hamburg Arena.
There was not much going on in the catacombs, the half-time break was over and most of them sat back on their seats.
Rieger has been a physiotherapist for nearly three decades at the HSV, and he enjoys a higher reputation than many vanished actors.
And so his request was also heard in a responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumb.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
Its command will have sounded similar: Here with gate two!
The implementation remained out.
“It wasn’t all good to look at today,” Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Also Bastian Reinhardt would have "wanted it more relaxed".
The 1-0 (1:0) was due to Mladen Petric's header hit (11th); and the fact that very weak Gladbachers could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summed up.
The Hamburg SV will be 121 years old on Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the spectators celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the flash table on the video wall, which marked their club as a class prime.
It's going to be a birthday without a real party.
“We know how to classify that,” said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the tabular intermediate testimony represents more the unpredictability of the league than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with their late commitments - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric and the Jansen, who was rejected by FC Bayern - finds itself slowly, but is not yet able to shine.
“We need more flair and more dribbles,” Jol said.
After the defeat of the vote
At Wall Street, the fear is gone.
First news of the failure of the rescue package temporarily caused the Dow Jones to break down by 700 points.
This was the biggest point loss in one day in its history.
Later, the Dow caught up again.
At around 8:30 p.m., the world’s most important stock market barometer recorded a minus of 5 percent at 10,579 counters.
The technology exchange Nasdaq was down more than seven percent at 1,548 points.
The biggest loser at the time was the Dow American Express, which lost nearly 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of around twelve percent.
No title could be added.
The shares of Bank Goldman Sachs declined by almost ten percent.
Only a few days ago, big investor Warren Buffett was involved in the company.
As part of the rescue plan, the funds will be provided for the purchase of so-called bad mortgage papers.
However, the sum is to be paid out not at a stroke, but step by step.
In return, the State should receive stock option notes from financial companies that could be redeemed at appropriate price developments to reduce the burden on the Treasury.
Stock prices in Europe and the USA in the downward direction
The billions in aid to banks in Europe and the United States do not solve investors’ doubts.
The stock price of the German major bank Hypo Real Estate is falling and is tearing the Dax down.
The U.S. Dow Jones index is losing despite the planned bailout of the financial market by the state.
Spectacular price losses from Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have dragged the Deutsche Aktienindex (Dax) deep into the minus.
Despite the rescue action by the German government and private banks, the share of the Munich real estate financier temporarily lost three quarters of its value, which Commerzbank gave up by more than 20 percent.
The Dax slipped well below the psychologically important 6,000-point mark, scoring a minus of 3.7 percent at 5,839 points.
The stock markets were on their knees all over the world.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US government’s $700 billion bailout could not be enough to relaunch the financial markets.
The Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10,809.25 points in the first trading hour.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the bailout plan, the vote in the Senate could follow on October 1.
The other European exchanges also knew only one direction: in London, the FTSE index initially declined by 3.2 percent, while the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the Japanese Nikkei lead index fell by 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 after initial gains.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Bed Index slipped 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the leading index Sensex lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12,595.75 counters.
In the MDax, shares of Arcandor surrendered following the announcement of a capital increase.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has signed the 23 million new shares.
The trade and tourism group also announced that the shares will not be sold to Thomas Cook.
Dark Matter Affects Flight of Space Probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been causing puzzlement in research: Dark matter affects the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by maneuvers.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity might not be quite right.
Nearly 18 years ago, the Ulysses spacecraft flew through space.
Due to soon freezing fuel lines, you now threaten the cold.
Among scientists, for years a mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion - the swing-by anomaly.
The Swing-By is a flight maneuver of space probes in which they receive additional vibration in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
This allows the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
However, what the researchers have been wondering for years is that the aeroplanes do not behave 100 percent the way one would expect from the ancient gravitational law.
Rather, there are irregularities in the speed.
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They called it a swing-by-anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter through a curvature of space, might not be quite right.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton still firmly believes that Einstein did not err, and tries to explain the swing-by-anomaly by using the so-called dark matter that astronomers have outdone in the universe.
"The anomaly could be caused by dark matter, which could also be very close to Earth," he writes.
The existence of dark matter has only been known to space researchers for about ten years.
From it, obviously, comes an attraction whose effect on other celestial bodies can be observed.
On the other hand, it itself is completely invisible, that is, it does not emit and reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, dark matter makes up well one-fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists abducted in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists abducted in Egypt are supposed to be free again, as the Italian foreign minister confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros in ransom.
Six hostages were killed in a shooting prior to the release.
Five Germans have been abducted in southern Egypt.
Salary negotiations are already underway.
Again and again, Germans are targeted by kidnappers.
WORLD ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists abducted in the Sahara seem to be free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, the Arab TV channel Al-Arabia and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release, according to reports from the Italian television channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We are currently checking their health status," Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian companions, are well and safe, the Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The motives for the shooting remain unclear before the release of the hostages: According to an Egyptian security official, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of the kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom," the official said.
It was "just about taking the hostages in," when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers killed six of the kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday and arrested two of them.
The hostages had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife to one of the hostages.
The daily El Masri El Jom reported, citing a German mediator, that the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men should be detained until the hijackers have a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Abuse of stepfather "leaded to suicide"
Years of abuse by her stepfather has led to a woman killing herself, a court has reported.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, received a six-year prison sentence after he confessed to eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Truro Criminal Court learned that he regularly imprisoned his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession, "I feel responsible for her death."
The court learned that Randle committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise had bound and blindfolded her before performing sexual acts while her mother was away to work in a restaurant.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Ms. Randle, who spent much of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was being prosecuted for the abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsay Quaife told the court that friends had said that Mrs. Randle, who had been a zealous surfer and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and "gave up her life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is believed that she killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession letter that ended: "I used to tie her up and connect her eyes."
“I didn’t force her sexually.
I feel responsible for her death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: “You are an extremely strange fetishist and for your victim it must have been terrifying, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the victim’s suicide.
Worse still is the fact that it is very unlikely that the case would have ended in court if she had not done so."
He added: “I take note of the impact, as described by Stephanie’s father and mother, her act over the years had on her daughter.
Otherwise, she would clearly have been a promising, successful and happy young woman.”
Officials responsible for lost data are indicted
The BBC has learned that the cabinet official, who had lost strictly confidential documents in a train in June, will be charged under the "Public Security Act".
The man was detached from the Defense Department when he lost two highly confidential documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It is the weakest prosecution within the law and there is no indication of criminal intent.
BBC defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the action was a surprise to many in Whitehall.
He said: "They would have thought that this would be dealt with internally at the Ministry of Defense and Cabinet."
The employee, whose name cannot be mentioned, will be charged in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the law, the clause that deals with the safe storage of information.
The Royal Prosecution Service recommended that the officer be charged by the Metropolitan Police because of the highly sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he produced contained classified assessments of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his house to a secret location.
Home Builders See B&B Costs in the Eye
British housing companies could cost more than <0xC2><0xA3>80 million in the house after saving Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The government provided <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion to protect Bradford & Bingley’s deposits to 2.6 million customers.
The interest on this loan is paid by all companies that receive money from investors, including the 59 construction companies
The director general of the Association of Housing Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was "untolerable" that the companies and their members would have to pay.
The $14 billion loan will eventually be repaid if Bradford & Bingley’s loans are repaid.
But the interest accrued in the meantime is charged each year to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Program confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in that number.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved prudently ... are now called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company would have to pay in proportion to the deposits it would hold, and that the companies together would have to pay about 18% of the costs.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that interest on the loan will amount to <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
This means that companies have to raise <0xC2><0xA3>81 million for the first year’s interest.
Adrian Coles, the director general of the housing association, told the BBC that he believes this is unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved prudently during the real estate boom are now called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less prudent.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the existence of the records in 1945.
“We will be watching all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs.”
The interest due in 2009 covers the seven months from the end of September of this year to the end of March.
In 2010, interest will be due for a full year and that could be almost twice as much.
As construction companies are two-way organizations without shareholders, their members will have to pay for the costs either through higher fees or lower interest on savings accounts.
Milk becomes five pence per liter more expensive
The people of Jersey are faced with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will raise the wholesale price of its milk by another five pence per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February, and comes after investigations were conducted by a consulting firm.
Retailers should decide for themselves whether they want to pass on the price increase to their customers.
Before the price increase in February, the wholesale price of Jersey milk last changed in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh is denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, meaning she could be arrested if she returns to the country.
Her defenders said the court denied bail regarding the indictment of blackmailing 50 million Taka ($729,700) by a businessman while she was prime minister.
The case is one of several floating charges of corruption against them.
Sheikh Hasina’s longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, called for the military-backed transitional government to first grant her unlimited freedom.
The correspondents say that although her detention has been granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear as part of her release whether she will be able to continue to remain at large when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers indicate that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court has rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail request because it says she does not need to be granted bail, as she is already on detention abroad to be treated abroad," her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
We will file a legal complaint against the Supreme Court."
Her lawyers claim that she needs bail to return from abroad to the country to prepare for the December elections.
Sheik Hasina is expected to return home after October 17, an Awami Alliance party chairman said on Sunday.
She was jailed last year after the army-backed transitional government took power, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against them.
Fears about the anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan
In the latest anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have not been vaccinated due to the violence associated with the Taliban, according to the United Nations.
Last week, the United Nations implemented a vaccination programme in six provinces.
However, they were unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for safety reasons.
According to a UN spokesman, this was the case despite the Taliban’s promise not to attack or hinder the thousands of staff who carried out the vaccinations.
BskyB loses lawsuit in ITV case
BskyB has lost its action against the decision of the Competition Commission to reduce its share in the competing broadcaster ITV.
The Competition Appeals Court has ordered BskyB to reduce its stake in ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission had claimed that BskyB’s share distorted competition and allowed it to have an unfair influence on ITV.
BskyB acquired its stake in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from purchasing ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that BskyB’s purchase of the stake in ITV raised doubts about ITV’s independence, prompting the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
The Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the communications office Ofcom have spoken out against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share of ITV was an unreasonable and exaggerated measure, in particular because BskyB had announced its intention to give up its voting rights.
New Investigation in the U.S. Attorney's Affair
The U.S. Attorney General has commissioned a special counsel to deal with the dismissal of nine U.S. attorneys-general in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Justice, in which the actions of the administration staff were criticized.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by fears that the lawyers had been dismissed for political reasons.
Special Investigator Nora Dannehy is now to clarify whether the officials interviewed during the investigation lied to the investigators in order to obstruct justice.
Serious allegations including criminal proceedings have not been fully investigated or clarified, Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appointment of a special counsel with the authority to force witnesses to testify was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when in December 2006, the Department of Justice expelled nine U.S. attorneys from their offices.
At that time, the ministry argued that prosecutors would be dismissed due to weak labor performance.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors were no worse off than many of their peers, prompting many observers to view the dismissals as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the prosecution of high-ranking Republican members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of election fraud by Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are tasked with investigating and prosecuting legal cases for the government.
They may be dismissed at any time, but may not be dismissed for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, came under fire because of the dismissals and has finally resigned his office.
A number of Justice Department officials have also resigned.
In particular, the Inspector General's report critically addressed the role of Gonzales, saying he was "mainly responsible" for the dismissals, "gave up" his leadership role, and was "extraordinarily disinterested" in the process.
Other officials, including former chief adviser to President Bush Karl Rove, have been criticized for the lack of cooperation with investigators.
Meat Loaf's epic song to be honored
The Rockstar Meat Loaf is to be honored during the music award ceremony "Q Award" for his epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will accept his special gold award during the award ceremony next week in London, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 album.
"Coldplay" leads the nominations for this year's award, having come into the narrower selection in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q Magazine, said there are some songs that go beyond such subjects as time and genre, and "Bat Out Of Hell" is certainly one of them.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released in the UK as a single in 1979 and reached number 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" has spent about nine years in the charts and sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years, one of which was an operation in 2003 due to irregular heartbeat after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel concerts due to acute throat inflammation.
Later it became known that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
Obscure street in town, often forgotten and possibly soon to sell
New York City has thousands of major highways, alleyways, side streets and other bypasses, some of which are famous and others just convenient.
Still, even for seasoned taxi drivers and long-time locals, it’s hard to tell where Extra Place is, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny street is located in the East Village and runs from First Street to the north between Bowery and Second Avenue without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty alley than an actively used thoroughfare.
There are also no street signs.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard road map.
This road still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxurious buildings on First Street.
It wants to redevelop Extra Place to create a clean passage to the shops and boutiques expected in the new buildings.
Among the other admirers is the long-standing neighborhood, which says it is fascinated by the short alley, simply because it is one of the remains of the house block’s past.
However, the city administration department, which is responsible for the protection and construction of the residential buildings and is responsible for the street, has no interest in maintaining them.
During a meeting of the Municipal Council’s Land Use Committee this month, representatives of the city administration and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
Nevertheless, the committee prefers that the road remains in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, said Susan Stetzer, the district manager in the municipal council 3.
“Only very little space has remained in the possession of the city and we want Extra Place to remain in the possession of the city,” she said.
"There could be offers on how to repair the road and operate what could be done by Avalon, but we also want public access to remain guaranteed."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that the small street will be redeveloped and seats will be set up, among other things, for a café to which the company wants to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the road was first made public during the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said the company wanted to use the road, but did not necessarily want to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate this cul-de-sac and make it a public meeting place," she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Department of Building Protection, said it was actually the city’s desire to sell the street and stressed the department’s task was to develop the real estate rather than manage it.
Compared to its colourful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has retained some of its historical impression.
Some believe that the street got its name in 1802, when a large farm that belonged to Philip Minthorne was divided among his numerous children and a narrow strip of land was claimed by no one.
The back door of the CBGB music club, the punk rock monument, which was closed in 2006, opened to the Extra Place and the street is probably best known as the backdrop for the photo on the cover of Ramones' "Rocket to Russia" album.
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
The road was full of scrap, lumps and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including the bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that this public land, as modest as it is, should continue to remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity – a virtually unchanged splitter of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog called "Jeremiah's Disappearing New York" (subtitled "The Book of Complaints: A Bitter Nostalgic View of the Dying City"), has published part of the City History Conversation on Extra Place, which was published in The New Yorker magazine in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at the time: “Extra Place is a small narrow cul-de-sac that even remains dark during the day and is marked by rusted metal doors of the warehouses, closed windows and weekly newspapers flying past rain gutters.”
With a few exceptions, the street looked exactly like this recently on an evening.
A rat ran through the back of the road, not far from the door that used to lead to the CBGB, where today there is a more expensive clothing store.
Graffiti was visible on the walls and an empty beer bottle lay on the floor not far from a fresh bundle of out-of-town newspapers.
Some passers-by said they rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the road could be polished up a bit.
Fields added that in his opinion, some people underestimate the charm of the street in its current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, damp and disgusting.
Debate on bilingual education: Education in an English-speaking environment
In this edition of the "Education Watch" Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of the candidates for bilingual training.
Lance T. Izumi, senior research fellow in California Studies and senior director of the Department of Educational Sciences at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs a School Choice".
Addressing Hispanic voters is a complicated task.
Barack Obama’s proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama’s election campaign mentions that “the likelihood of African-American and Hispanic students successfully finishing school is lower than that of white students” – which is true.
To close this gap, Obama’s education plan specifically recommends, among others, a bilingual transitional phase in education for those who are only learning English.
Yet the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on teaching in languages other than English, contradicts his interest in reducing the gap in school performance.
Let’s take as an example “Sixth Street Prep,” a primary school in eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of students are Hispanic and come from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom are only recently in the country, learn English.
Yet in 2008, an astonishing 100 percent of fourth-grade students passed the state exam in mathematics at a good level.
Surprisingly, 93 percent of fourth-year school children were rated as good in the English exam.
This astonishing success was achieved by other methods than those preferred by Obama.
Sixth Street School focuses on review and practice, constant control of knowledge, and an attitude that tolerates no exceptions.
In addition, the school is practicing the approach of training in an English-speaking environment, which is precisely the point Obama should pay attention to, according to the head of the school, Linda Mikels.
This approach emphasizes the almost exclusive use of the English language in professional lessons.
Ms. Mikels, who rejects the idea of bilingual education, told me that the school would have a remarkable success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico. 12 months later, one would enter the classroom and not be able to recognize him anymore.
“It works,” she said, “it works for us.”
Would Obama take a school like the “Sixth Street Prep” as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other English-taught students?
The school’s achievements would make the answer to this question easy, but the educational policy positions within his own party (the national educational associations have long supported the idea of bilingual education) and his own consistent support for bilingual education make predictions about Obama’s answer uncertain.
While agreeing to the point that immigrants should learn English, he has recently trivialized the issue by noting that people should stop worrying about legislation targeting “English only.”
Instead, he said, “You should make sure your child can speak Spanish.”
If Obama really wants to close the performance gap, he should carefully consider educational models that work, rather than contempt and trivialize them.
Oil prices fall again due to fears about the economy
The oil price fell sharply on Monday due to fears that even the U.S. bailout plan for financial markets might not be enough to revive the economy.
Commodity futures on the New York Stock Exchange fell 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel in the morning session.
Since last Monday, the price has fallen by more than $20.
In the last two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by both the financial turmoil on Wall Street and by strong turbulent storms in the Gulf of Mexico.
After prices peaked at $145.29 per barrel in July, they have fallen to almost $90 per barrel this month, then rise again as a result of huge uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors were once again concerned, even though congressional officials had announced that they had agreed on a rescue plan over the weekend, which should be the largest in history.
This news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the foremost final chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government announcement on Monday, Citigroup is expected to purchase the Wachovia Corporation’s banking operations.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partly nationalised the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place over the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it appears that it has not managed to revive the mood in the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, demand for goods, including oil, is expected to continue to decline.
Deutsche Bank analysts have written in a message to investors that forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain.
We believe they will continue to write that the commodity markets will also be affected.
“From the perspective of commodity markets, we are most concerned about whether the US virus is spreading globally, especially to China.”
Bank analysts have corrected their expectations for oil consumption due to weak economic growth for the coming year, and have lowered their forecasts for oil and gas prices for 2009 by 20%.
Team record by series in the second quarter
Homeland defender Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all after running up more often in the last eight and a half years than anyone else in the Jets jersey.
Then, on Sunday, he saw the second quarter, in which the Jets turned an unsuccessful game into a triumphal move.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
After a sloppy game between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which corresponded to the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when quarterback Brett Favre’s pass arrived at Lavernue’s Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, it marked the perfect start to an afternoon in which their evolving collaboration took a giant step forward.
Favre found Coles in this quarter for two more touchdowns, one slipping out as an outside defender and the other 10 seconds before the end of the half.
“I didn’t make much effort,” Coles says about the passes that went to Coles.
“He is a super player.
Our vote has voted, no matter what people think.”
While Favre and Cole were playing catches, the defense took quarterback Kurt Warner apart.
External defender Darrelle Revis picked up an accidental pitch and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and caught it.
Linebacker David Bowens then caused a loss to Warner.
The last ball loss, forced at Bowens, was probably the craziest.
The Cardinals had captured the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the Jets recaptured the ball and Jay Feely turned a 20-yard shot to 34 to 0 lead.
These were the most points the Jets had ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini, the Jets' coach, replied, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
In response to both, for the Jets left 21 points in the third quarter without scoring a single, Mangini said, "Believe me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points were scored in a short time."
Soothed giver laissez-passer beats its world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has again shown why some consider him to be the best long-distance runner of all time after breaking his own record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to make it 42.2 kilometers in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved his previous result of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had achieved last year in Berlin.
Gebrselassie, 35, has thus set his 26th world record in his versatile career, in which he has achieved at least one world championship title or set a world record on every track from one kilometre to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Beijing Olympic Marathon, out of fear that air pollution could exacerbate his asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - in the sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the finish - Gebrselassie has won at an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have moved on long distances, the record time for marathon in the last 10 years has fallen by more than 2 minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in 1998 in Berlin with the result 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the press that he had had cramps in his wad two weeks ago and was therefore unable to train for a week.
Apparently, he was refreshed after a break and did not come back rusted.
"I'm so happy," he told reporters.
“Everything went perfectly.
I resumed training a week ago and had some concerns today, but in the end everything was great."
He has been criticized — particularly in Kenya, Ethiopia’s East African rival — for over-orchestrating his races, avoiding many of the world’s best marathon stars in general, relying too much on the race leaders as if it were a track race, and setting world records over the competition.
But this criticism hardly hurts the size of Gebrselassie as a long-distance runner.
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the centre of the route in 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge the pacemaker after the pacemakers had slowed down.
A little more than three miles before the finish, Gebrselassie made his last start to separate from Kwambai, who came second in 2:05:36, thus improving his best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
For women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, completed a remarkable year by showing the seventh fastest result of all time at 2:19:19.
The world record of 2:15:25 is held by Paul Radcliff from Great Britain.
Last spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko had surprisingly won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing because of problems described as back injuries, but she recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She skilfully planned her run by having a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners out first, but overhauled after 30 kilometers.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia finished second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
The pride and hardships in the life of the black population, in a city of a very special kind
Hidden between the expanses of amusement parks in the outskirts of Orlando, a few miles away from the sparkling, noisy and gigantic hustle and bustle, lies a quiet city where the pride and complications of African-American culture come to light.
Eatonville, the first entirely black city in the country and the hometown of Zora Neale Hurstons, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three croquet courts, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guavas, 2 schools and no prison."
Today it is a pilgrimage site.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous Harlem Renaissance author.
And yet the city she describes – and which made her a tourist destination by taking her into the Florida travel guide, which was produced by the Federal Writers’ Project during the Depression – is and remains in many ways a place of the very special sort.
Eatonville is as independent, dignified, and private as it was in the 1930s when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "knows so little about us that he doesn't know what he's missing."
Even today, in a year when a black presidential candidature, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open discussion about race relations, many here are still saddened to be watched by outsiders.
“We are very concerned about how our story is told,” says Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a resident of the city and a community member of the city’s oldest church.
It must be true."
Eatonville has long been defined as the paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is both a historical example of the black movement and a community of almost 2,400 inhabitants, where the poverty rate is twice as high as the national average.
It is on the one hand a stronghold of literature and on the other an example of the - sometimes condemned, sometimes praised - black culture of the rural South, which has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that residents here are both proud and on their guard.
And so the concerns about Eatonville's image actually started with Zora, as everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented her hometown to the world in books that came from the heart and were written in word of mouth, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973).
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a road that leads through the often-forgotten center of Florida, to the scene of black history and human drama.
Like Oskar in real life as well as in literature, Hurston led readers to the store of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private affairs.
"Beyond the street to the left," she wrote, "is the brown-and-white painted modern school, with its well-kept gardens and playgrounds that Howard Miller always cares about, though he can hardly read and write."
She also mentioned the new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of any kind and what-also-always fits into hour rooms."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with self-government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage, and sex.
This was certainly not a travel guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by everyone.
“Zora described things as they were,” said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls who immortalized Hurston by quoting the men who sang songs about her beauty that were full of sexual allusions.
She added, "Some people didn't like it."
One still remembers Hurtson as a lively eccentric who returned regularly after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
August Franklin, 77, remembered that when Hurston came brewing into the city, she usually did so without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants, in a city that even today imagines something about her venerable clothing style.
According to Mr. Franklin, most residents were fascinated, while many despised them.
“People were always happy to see Zora,” Mr. Franklin said.
But "she never stayed too long," he added as he swayed in his chair, on a back-facing terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, in which Hurston was most likely baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were stolen.
Along with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived.
In Eatonville, there was no big commemoration, no public readings in big style.
“I don’t think they understood their contribution to the world or their legacy at all,” said Valerie Boyd, author of “Wrapped in Rainbows,” a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
The turn came in the 80s.
Orange County authorities wanted to lay a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the community's slow two-lane main road.
Orlando’s suburbs had already pushed Highway 4 through the western outskirts of the city.
The proposal was submitted when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult phase in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mixing brought hatred into the community.
"At this time, a bunch of white boys often came and they threw oranges and stuff at the people sitting away," Mr. Franklin said.
“There was once a woman who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car."
In 1955, Hurston, in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, questioned the Supreme Court's demand to enforce integration by calling its decision against the school council in Brown's case "offensive rather than respectful of my race".
Residents today say that although the lifting of racial segregation was positive in some respects, it weakened the group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its youth.
“Black children were used to being hugged – I remember – they hugged their teacher in the morning and they hugged their teacher in the evening,” said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and managing director of the Eatonville Community Protection Nonprofit Group.
This could be maintained for so long, she added, until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
“You didn’t hug his white teacher because he was a white teacher — I mean, there’s a cultural divide,” Nathiri said.
However, civil rights have helped to make room for more Zora Neale Hurstons – black authors, actors and artists who overcame prejudice, as they did, with positive self-confidence and statements like, “How can anyone deny themselves the joy of my society!
I don't understand."
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker set out for Hurston's nameless tomb and began to fight for the revival of her fame.
Five years later, a highly acclaimed Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway was found in the bookshelves, and again made them part of the American literary canon.
The long-distance project came at a time when Eatonville’s most famous daughter was once again in the public eye.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community began planning a Hurston Festival in 1988 to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and many return for the celebration each January.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road plans.
“The plans of a five-lane highway were revitalizing the city, accelerating the whole thing at top speed, arousing real citizen pride,” said Ms. Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd put it a little easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the long-distance road project has contributed to a change in the self-image of the city.
There were more and more train travelers, like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been going to church here since 1993, and locals began to re-evaluate the past.
Eatonville was included in the national historical register in 1998.
A new one-story library (named, of course, after Hurston) opened in 2006 on newly paved and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still a special feature in Florida: just 6 miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes feel like a back alley in the summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It is now 90% black.)
Outsiders in search of the history of Eatonville and its significance are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews, prior approval is necessary and certain things – such as the mural of Eatonville’s oldest church, painted by a white man and depicting black men in field work – are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs. Jones, a courageous, confident teacher with a fondness for dark red, still fear that their shielded community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time that the Hurston Festival grew bigger, a heightened degree of pride was also born.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw his entire race: beautiful, with all his problems, neither worse nor better and just as proud, creative and diligent, silly and mixed like any other racial and ethnic group in America.
It is the sincere love of this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin’s nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who intends to return to Eatonville after college to work in the city administration or the police, who he says may need some help.
And even the younger ones, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who just pass through here will think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,'" Alondra Kenon said recently on a Sunday after the church.
"But if you actually stop and look at its history for a moment, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York we speak fluently financial Latin.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from the newsstands and the huge television screens in Times Square, they wouldn’t even notice that they’re in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that above their heads, in the shoebox-like offices with the glass facades, bankers and hedge fund managers that have the monopoly in New York, they have the worst horror workday every day since the 1929 stock market crash.
The suppliers still push the metal tea-wages along the sidewalks with loud flaps and carry trays loaded with muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latinos are still lurking between apartments, like human pack animals loaded with around 50 ironed t-shirts hanging on a yoke-like rod lying on their shoulders.
Office employees are still waiting for food stalls on their breakfast trays on the sidewalks and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a weekday between 4pm and 7pm.
It didn’t feel like a crisis at all until I decided on Thursday afternoon to open a new savings account because of all the downfall talk.
Although I had decided to put my duty on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase tribal branch, about 20 people were already in line.
Not at the cash desks to withdraw or deposit money, but at the customer service desk where regular customers order checkbooks, tourists ask about the way to Macy's department store and where new customers open accounts.
Most before me, so I learned later from Starr, my "personal bank employee with a license", stood for the same reason as I snare.
However, unlike me, they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, in places where they commuted from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They had withdrawn money from so-called thrifts (a bit like a construction savings bank), cooperative banks, and those local savings banks that only have branches in one state, saying they treat their customers like family.
In the past year, 15 of these banks have gone quietly bankrupt.
In the past few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went into bankruptcy over and as last Friday New Yorkers drove home over the weekend, Wachovia, another bank that owns $440 billion in savings, was looking for a saving buyer.
In fear of another collapse, the office and store employees standing in front of me brought their bars to a bank that is considered a safe haven, a bank that is responsible for most of the rescue purchases on Wall Street.
Very normal New Yorkers have acquired a flowing financial latin over the last few weeks.
A woman on the phone in my Chinese grocery store was so familiar with Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bankrupt, and their skinny-looking CEO Dick Fuld, as if they were blaspheming about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the 50-year-old uniformed concierge at my block, got away from our usual entertainment themes about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds," she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I've changed, I'm not taking any more risks."
Muslim graves violated during right-wing slide in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-wing judge of the Austrian right-wing Freedom Party of Austria, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian right-wing Pertei Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008, to represent the organization "Cities against Islamization".
They carry signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is depicted, crossed with a red line.
Police accused right-wing extremists of defamation at a Muslim cemetery in Austria, on the same weekend at which far-right parties recorded significant gains in the country’s parliamentary elections.
More than 90 graves in the cemetery in Traun near Linz were severely damaged in an organized action, according to police.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols such as the David Stern on some of the tombs, but criminal officials believe this is an attempt to disguise the motive of extremists driven by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shaken" by the news of the grave defamation that took place as the Muslim month of Ramadan was approaching its end.
At the same time, a round of scrutiny is underway in Austria after the country slipped to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The FP<0xC3><0x96> and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, which both far-right parties received nearly 30% of the vote, advocated a strict anti-immigrant law in their election campaign and some of their voting rights were criticized by opponents as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the FP<0xC3><0x96>, which won 18% of the vote, advocated a ban on headscarves and burkas and even expressed his dislike for food, which is commonly associated with Islam.
At his last rally in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets with the argument that these political symbols are a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the election, saying that the extreme right is the politically strongest bloc in the country, suggest that this new development is based on young voters worrying about their future in the European Union.
Travel ban for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the glam rock star who has been convicted of child sexual abuse, has been banned from travelling to France and Spain.
Judges imposed a six-month lockdown on Glitter after he informed the authorities controlling him that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
Police in Kent were granted an overseas travel ban last Thursday after submitting evidence to judges of Glitter’s acquittal for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford District Court in Kent, but was represented by the law firm Corker Binning.
A court spokesman said: “On Thursday, September 25, Kent Police applied to the Ashford District Court for permission to prevent Mr. Paul Glad’s travel abroad to France and Spain until March 25.
Paul Gadd was not personally present."
As required by the Register of Sexual Offenders, Glitter, 64, had informed authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his scheduled departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could result in a prison sentence of 5 years.
Police in Kent said they would not discuss individual cases or glitters of possible whereabouts in the country.
A spokeswoman for Kent’s police unit said: “The police in Kent will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad.”
“In our view, it is easier to control someone who is located in the UK because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks.”
“It is the primary concern of the police in Kent to protect the residents of Kent and we are working closely to monitor the behavior of registered sex offenders in the country to minimize any risk that may exist to the population.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of 2 girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to fly to London.
But he said he didn’t feel comfortable and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him through passport control and he flew back and forth to Hong Kong after some time.
Chinese authorities also refused him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted that he return to Britain.
Finally, on 22 August, he arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge District Court in West London, as Scotland Yard had successfully requested permission to request that he register as a sex offender.
Glitter had previously been jailed in the UK for four months in 1999 for possession of images of child abuse.
Interior Minister Jacqui Smith is reassured and satisfied that Glitter has been prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
<0x60>I welcome the master behind the stage to capture his character', Günter Brauer, photographer.
No paragraphs, no ruffles, no costumes for the performance.
The nature of the great flamenco dancers who give up concentration and devote themselves to interpretation to get a relaxed look as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand, artists
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, into these moments that are foreign to the audience, I know when I can find a gesture typical of the personality, the depth of a stolen look or the strength of the hands that are worried because they will not enter the stage.
In his project <0x60>Flamenco-people', the German photographer Günter Bauer presents alternating theatrical performances on stage with singers, dancers and guitarists. From this side he was still little known to the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of flamenco representation on different levels.
The exhibition, which belongs to the program of the month of photography of Flamenco, <0x60>reflects the international importance of Flamenco, which is becoming more and more important from day to day,' explains the artist, making it clear that <0x60>Flamenco-people' <0x60>can be any person, but when you look at the photos, the artist notices that there are no typical pictures.
Very normal people on the portraits are artists who are able on stage to convey passion, sadness, joy and thus move the audience.
In order to capture the personality of these artists, you do not have to take photos on stage.
Her personality and character are in her heart.
What I was interested in was to create a personal atmosphere that would allow me to capture the characters of the greatest flamenco champions with the camera."
Inspired by the Cante de las Minas festival, Bauer went on a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the camera’s image sorting function and the available material, images reminiscent of classical photography were created.
The use of various stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the image, giving the image the modernity and the idea, as the farmer understands Flamenco: 'music with traditional roots that changes and surprises every day'.
These are not only the dance, the song or the instrumental play itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, who seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for a certain something, which becomes visible in the form of hearing, of being, is and was the fixed goal of this work, which will be presented in the next time in the gallery of El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata.
Famous figures in Flamenco, among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others, are among the narrow selection of nearly seventy artists photographed.
The project became an anthology of flamenco and will soon appear as a book, with all portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer’s passion for portraits led him to take up this idea again two years ago and realize it as ‘portraits of the veterans of sport’ (‘SportARTproject’).
Although the concepts of the project <0x60>Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer to <0x60>I really like to photograph people, get to know them and put me in their state of life, whether it is for a short moment or for a longer time.
I think that in the field of photography, portrait is the most difficult genre.
You meet or encounter people, personalities you sometimes don’t know at all, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to take a photo.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.'
Today’s collection of flamenco portraits entitled Flamenco-people is on display in the gallery of El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata, which is located in the street called la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the la Alameda de Hércules street. The exhibition can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admits that the Roma he is writing is “a madness”.
He does not yet know where the novel takes place and what it is about, but Mario Vargas Llosa is persistently trying to advance the project he is currently working on, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in the Congo for twenty years and moved to the Amazon area.
Yesterday, during his attendance at the Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel laureate admitted that the project he is dealing with is “a madness” and “everything indicates that he does not have to write the novel.”
<0x60>If I had been wise, I would not have done it, but I will do it and hope to finish the novel sometime', so he ended his participation in the festival, where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within four days he had seen hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who had gone to see him.
The author of <0x60>La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made predictions.
Vargas Llosa, the premium winner of the Hay Festival and voiced by most attendees, is compared to the old edition of <0x60>Our mutual friend' and can be seen at the Juan Bravo Theatre.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo and found that he had a lot of audience in front of him, that he had a lot of work to do, and that the Peruvian, who has a wonderful memory and a great sense of humor, was not given enough time to go through it all again: how his vocation to literature, which came out of <0x60>extraordinarily', was created.
The Hispano-American novelist admitted that there is <0x60>no way of saying' what to measure and where to know if books change life, <0x60>but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a fleeting experience', Vargas Llosa said of the <0x60>whoever says that <0x60>I're going to say' that <0x60>I'm going to tell' people that <0x60>I'm going to tell'
At the festival in Pozoblanco the weather did not play out: bullfighting cats partly fell out.
After the announced bullfighters found that the ground of the square was in poor condition, the bullfighting festival with which the festival was to be concluded in Pozoblanco was postponed to yesterday morning.
Thus, with the consent of Ferm<0xC3><0xAD>n Boh<0xC3><0xB3>rquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, the organizer decided to postpone the bullfighting party.
Thus, the festival of unstable weather was suspended, which is why two out of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday it was raining, which is why the second planned bullfighting festival could not be celebrated.
The Matadore group consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro D<0xC3><0xAD>as and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the bullfighting arena.
There was only one party on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and triumphed, after which he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
On the same evening, Alejandro Talavante met two horns and one ear of the bull, which he had achieved more through galloping than through his bullfighting skills.
And even worse was El Juli, which went through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After fighting so badly, a large part of the audience reacted to his second fight with buh-rufen.
In <0xC3><0x81>lava, two people wanted to escape the control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand kilos of hashish.
Tomorrow: five minutes before ten.
Traffic controls in Ertzaintza, in the urban area of Armi<0xC3><0xB1>on (<0xC3><0x81>lava).
Two police officers asked the drivers of the car to stop, after which they took the flight.
It seemed as if they would not have to stop with the load of more than two thousand kilos of hashish.
Police tracked her down and arrested one of the drivers, the 28-year-old man known as A.A.J., as reported by the Interior Ministry of the Basque State.
The arrested person was charged with drug trafficking and forgery of official documents.
The incident occurred when the traffic police officers of the <0xC3><0x81>lava region had already completed traffic control on the N-1 and drove past the urban area of Armi<0xC3><0xB1>on.
They decided to stop a car to carry out the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to evade the control.
The police began the chase until after a few kilometers the car stopped on the edge strip. At that moment, the drivers got out of the car to flee over a country road to a forest area.
In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug dealers transported 2,178 kilos of hashish, which was seized by the police.
The front of the car was loaded with hashish bundles, which were later sent to other police stations for precise laboratory analysis and weighing the bundles.
In addition, the officials found that the license plate was “double” so that it did not match the license plate indicated in the car papers, which is why an additional arrest was made for forgery of official documents.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza continue the investigation to arrest the second suspect, who, as already mentioned, was able to escape, but also to determine the origin of the seized drugs.
The 28-year-old A.A.J., who was arrested, was taken to a police station for questioning and will be brought before the judge in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
Actress Heather Locklear, known for her role as Amanda from the Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
A witness has watched as she tries in a rather strange way to get out of her parking hole in Montecito, a California traffic police spokesman told People magazine.
The witness told in detail that Locklear “pressed through the accelerator pedal after 4:30 p.m. and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car back or forward from the parking lot, and as she drove back, she grabbed her sunglasses a few times.”
A little later, the Witness, who at first probably did not realize the actress, saw that Locklear stopped on a nearby road and got out of the car.
The witness was the person who approached the emergency service because she had ‘fear of living for Locklears’.
When police arrived, they found the actress sitting in her car, standing across the street, blocking traffic.
“She seemed to be clueless,” they said, so they took the policemen to a special drug and alcohol center to do a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative, excessive alcohol consumption was excluded from the first moment. <0x60>The first observations of the officials as a result, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug,' said the spokesman.
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an indeterminate substance that could not be determined and taken to a local detention facility around 7 p.m.
Two months ago, Locklaer was discharged from a clinic in Arizona, where she was treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian Association of the United Left becomes responsible for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the main coordinator of the VL and Member of the United Left, has today assured that the regional association for education will be the one to make the decision in the case of the former city council for youth and sports of the city hall in Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who was resigned from business last week after he was accused of hearing
"In such cases, I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one who must take over the responsibility for this," Llamazares pointed out the course of action the party must take against the one who has so far sat as a city council in the municipality of Seville.
Nevertheless, the chairman of the VL defended the need for “transparency” in the possible investigations of the violations that Silva may have started: “The VL has always insisted that such cases receive maximum transparency”.
With regard to this issue, he stressed that education has “a strict code of ethics for all public offices.”
<0x60>Sangre de Mayo': Hero Book by Garci
Inspired by <0x60>Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s, José Luis Carci in <0x60>Sangre de mayo' represents the revised version of the famous revolt of the Spaniards against the French. This is an admirable film in filmography, with about 15 million euros investment for the filming.
In this way, the Cineast has tried to <0x60>represent a lot of personalities and social analysis', which he has always admired in the works of the famous novelist, Carci explained today at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a at the beginning of a long list of actors.
<0x60>Sangre de mayo' with a film length of more than two and a half hours, will be presented this Friday in cinemas and later on the channel Telemadrid as a four-hour miniseries.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of the literature of Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s, assures that thanks to this filming his <0x60>childhood dream' was fulfilled. This he owes to Esperanza Aguirre, who three years ago commissioned him from the Autonomous Community of Madrid to make a commemorative film for the second century celebration on the basis of the Nacional's first film in Madrid.
The total contribution of 15 million, made by the Autonomous Community of Madrid for filming, offers Garci, as he added, the <0x60>unique possibility' with the help of decorations and appropriate clothing the image of the <0x60>confused Spain, which chose the wrong leader for the struggle' because the people were to be represented by the struggle for independence and under the rule of VII.
However, the Cineast regrets that one could not count on the funding as with <0x60>Alatriste' or <0x60>Los fantasmas de Goya' (twice as high as with <0x60>Sangre de Mayo'), so some scenes from the script with Horacio Valc<0xC3><0xA1>rcel, with whom Garci almost his entire career was not co-operated, could not be
For this reason, Garci, who was also the film director in <0x60>Volver a comparaci<0xC3><0xB3>n', contributed through his usual way of working: he put himself on stage to the actors with whom one must first rehearse before starting to shoot and for those who had not done casting, he appeared in the film to help, the <0x60>demonstrating' and recreating
Many actors he encounters in Sangre de Mayo have to repeat in front of his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rell<0xC3><0xA1>n, Carlos Larra<0xC3><0xB1>aga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar nominee in four nominations (one of which he has won), is of the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates representing Spain before the Academy of Hollywood this year represents a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither <0x60>Sangre de mayo' nor <0x60>Siete mesas de billiarde gir<0xC3><0xA8>s' ci
Garci does not expect any awards for this film.
“At first you think you’re working for the offspring, later you realize it’s just for prosperity, and now you’re happy if you’ve produced another film,” Garci says after more than 30 years of work.
Isabel Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n recalls the memory of the dancer from Seville T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville adores a dancer who also comes from Seville.
Carmen T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia: her father was Catalan (Floren<0xC3><0xA7> T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Ferrer) and the mother Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the Triana district and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and an expert in oriental dance.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of women, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, vegetarian, and advocated for the abolition of the corset, which restricted the free female movement.
Isabel Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n was fascinated by the life of this woman, who left her mark on the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe between the wars.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed to me this role, which seemed impossible to me.
“We’re not trying to talk about her life, but to preserve her spirit,” said the flamenco dancer.
Her dance basics have helped me a lot in Flamenco.
“The Dance of the Butterfly” seemed to me like Guajira, or “The Dance of the Snake” like Tango.
Her dancing was sensual and I’ve been told that my dancing is also in this aesthetic area,” she claims.
The production is expected to have two exceptional collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing for Isabel again in one of her performances, as he did in <0x60>La puerta aperta'; and with flamenco master Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work together with one of her ex-students.
Matilde plays T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola, a very mature personality.
I’m happy because she agreed to participate in my work, and I feel very honored.”
The production also includes musical composition and the guitarists Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the vocals of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Mor<0xC3><0xB3>n; with the percussion of El P<0xC3><0xA1>jaro, as well as the viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra J<0xC3><0xBA>arez, he <0x60>liked the role of the
This work also tells in a certain way about the life of this woman, who became known in places as far away as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, although she usually lived in London.
“I wanted to recall her, because I think she is one of the women who has an enormous influence on a certain era and whose works no one knows how to appreciate today and therefore even less,” says Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n.
The performance will take place today at 20:30 at the Lope de Vega Theater.
The publication of the book <0x60>Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of <0x60>Diario de un poeta recién casado' in the Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez married in 1916 Zenobia, offers a corresponding atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council of Culture, the five-day celebration of the 'Juannian and the Triennium of
Thus <0x60>the Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n' is completed with the new edition of this work, with the international congress, which takes place in New York, with the restoration of the House-Museum of Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez-Zenobia and with the hiking exhibition <0x60>Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez' is now reached in different places: <0x60>Aquel chopo de luz' and was in New York, which was in May he
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of <0x60>Diario de un poeta recién casado', published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The aim is to make the person and work of the Andalusian world poet more known.
The U.S. can't imagine itself without Paul Newman
“Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them.”
This sentence comes from the actress Sally Field, who collaborated with him in "Sensation Reporter", and from the then-dominant idea of American cinema, which was abandoned, came from all over America to Newman with his enthusiastic idea and followed her.
Look at what it cost him to win the Oscar.
And when he retired in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Nevertheless, it was a big blow for everyone.
"What one feels sometimes is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend," said Robert Redford, crying, "my life and my country were the greatest insanity of his life."
No one was afraid to be ridiculous or exaggerated.
As the “father” of cinema and the homeland, he died at a sad moment in which fear of terrorists and market collapse reigns, in which the depressed self-esteem of Americans is on the hopeless search for reasons to regain dignity.
If only a few people remain in this difficult time without virtue to admire, you don’t necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all he embodied a platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered various losses as well as profits: from the foundation committed to the fight against drugs and in honor of his son from the first marriage, who died of overdose, was founded to his own brand of homemade and organic products.
All this is a gift for the country, where it took him a lot of effort to enforce against a deadly food culture.
A wide wave of astonishment strikes across Hollywood without taking into account nationalities and citizenship.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one person died, but the entire era.
Sam Mendes, director and Oscar winner, said working with Newman was no more or no less than the tip of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
“The greatest of us all has left us,” confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who dare to live as Paul Newman lived today: to maintain high standards of justice, to lead a responsible private life, far from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today’s media jungle.
But there is someone who tries, and Paul Newman was an example of that.
He got divorced once and was married fifty years later to Joanne Woodward, whom he was faithful to, although there certainly were many ways to be.
“Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have fillet at home?” he joked often himself.
In heaven, he will be proud that on earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
“Of all the great roles he played, he was not so proud of anyone as he was of the faithful husband, the loving father, the attentive grandfather, and the philanthropist,” they say.
For the Olympic Games, the streets of Madrid are deficient.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to host some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, it may well be 2016.
But I ask myself, ‘Are we prepared for this?’
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say that it is not true!
It was described as the perfect road, and in my judgment, it was the worst road with everything around it.
Of course, this is a lot of nonsense if you would pay attention to the evaluation and I could examine it, something like this clearly would not have happened.
But let’s go through everything from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with the ticketing that allows you to go first.
It doesn’t seem bad to me either, but if they already let you go, then they should also give you everything (including chip to avoid traffic jams).
I don't think so.
Here they only let you get the ticket (the first nonsense, which is just to go there) and (after an endless queue) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only in size <0x60>S' (a second nonsense, because I need the size XL)
Where do we actually live?
Or is it that after the crisis it was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts made of less fabric?
So, things like this are a trifle compared to the days on the street.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
The wait has taken more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a street where 11,000 people are expected.
After all, as expected, the road started and we hadn’t let our backpacks lie in front of it, even if it had been successful once, but it would have been harder to get them back.
In addition, during this 40-minute waiting period it looked like rain, so there was a temptation to organize a popular uprising and raid the house.
I think tomorrow some 500 people will certainly have pneumonia and some like me will not even appear in time for classification because of this chip I got, I can already think that the output was wrongly stamped.
Of course, if you asked me for a perfect road, this road would never come to my mind.
So I think we will dream for a long time of a city that is well prepared for the Olympics
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the <0x60>Emerging Technology Conference', hosted by MIT, Microsoft presented the progress of the new image recognition system and human interaction, a being of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, which is however capable of doing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or, in the case of Microsoft, going to the company's itinerary).
Thanks to a camera and a shape and face recognition system, this receptionist can recognize how many people are in the room, who they are, and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the keywords of their conversation.
It can also classify the attendees into groups after the conversations.
In the presentation video, <0x60>the receptionist' notices a third person, but she understands that this person does not belong to the group that is talking to her, and that she is not a company employee either.
She asks if the person here wants to visit someone and replies that she will be listening soon.
All without the blue screen shot
Impressive
This is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, such as the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week we talked very superficially about the change of strategy of Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be faster and not have as many programs involved.
Steve Ballmer noted that if computers were equipped with the most necessary, instead of filling them with commercial trash, they would work five times faster. Man, Steven, that will only be for the few.
Everything is only a finding when you consider that Microsoft added some feature and <0x60>extras' in Windows versions.
The change of direction is worth it
Microsoft is right, the operating system is gradually losing importance, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the web, it was part of the theory that it was Google’s first step to competing with Windows.
Many have pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary for hardware and software to work at the same time.
The operating system performs the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or husband when it comes to communicating something to his mother-in-law.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but one has to think of its ‘death’, not as an absolute, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system every time, and more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run Firefox, Explorer or Chrome, and every day we spend more time surfing than in the ‘windows’ environment.
What is the use of half of the applications in the computer?
Less is more
And Windows 7 needs to be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Easier, not so exaggerated, less complicated.
Microsoft’s interest is more in integrating its online services, which can then eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need it, no doubt about it. I give a small example of this.
The photo of this place I took in Redmond, in one of the recreation rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
A sign is attached to the refreshment machine: <0x60>Your search. Our future'. It prints a request to use your own tool for online search.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of employees at Microsoft used Google for online searches.
By the way, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has been delayed.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, rather even in 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the opportunity to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the market simultaneously.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and iPhone are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso put it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in <0x60>Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in <0x60>Der Pate' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time, it belongs to the clothing of a well-built pastor.
When we start to count the countless star appearances, we can go back to the image of a very strong man, with a pointed beard, who had lifted heavy weights in a walking circus.
Basically, this is a typical male cotton t-shirt, sleeveless and waisted.
Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles, however, outperforms all other brands.
First, because of its great name, although it is called in a narrow circle <0x60>Marcel'. Legend has it that the name origin is associated with sport and came from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
<0x60>La Marcel' excels all because of its excellent cotton, because of its distinctive unisex cut and is distinguished by a small Belgian flag (slightly recognizable), which have these T-shirts as a detail on the neckline.
And beware, the Belgian company focuses not only on the production of <0x60>tanks'.
You also have College Sweatshirts, Boxers Retro, Cardigans and Cashmere, Cotton Pants, Striped T-Shirts, Babies, Mini Shorts
Modeled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it is very unfortunate to use them as underwear.
They are very charming.
'I want to be a young mother; I don't worry about the candidate'
Her big appearance with her sister didn’t stop her from developing her own personality.
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Cruz is graceful, but full of joy.
At the moment, the Gruz brothers take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For M<0xC3><0xB3>nica, this means much more than for some pretty and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of the company Mango, moved there her residence and also makes the presentation of the main awards in fashion sponsored by the Spanish fashion house.
Merciful and shy, winner on the short distances.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season, which my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango, and I also attended the presentation of the second edition of <0x60>Mango Fashion Awards' and took part in the dinner in honor of Valentino.
A very intensive working time, which is exciting at the same time.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, as well as I, are fascinated by the cinema of the 50s and 60s; there we find a lot of ideas.
I like to walk through a city and watch women dress up, combine their clothes, which I often do.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end, everything comes together in one and these areas have many commonalities.
Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been fascinated by clothes; I’ve always wanted to go to my grandmother’s house to wander around my aunt’s wardrobes and see her clothes.
That was great, almost better than going to an amusement park.
Even later, as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to the clothes.
You know, we dancers like it so much to have our own style in class and at rehearsals to look in the mirror and feel good about it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you put yourself in the real acting role.
After all, everything is connected with each other, it is so, a lot of respect for the costume designer and their professionalism.
Recently you turned 30, did you fall into a crisis?
Oh, wow.
I feel better than ever, as a 30-year-old I feel good.
I think the woman becomes mature, has experience and can enjoy life with fewer mistakes.
I am not afraid of my biological clock.
I’ve been doing the things I’ve wanted to do since I was a kid, and that has given me a lot of inner joy.
So, you're thinking about becoming a mother, aren't you?
I’ve known for a long time that I’m going to be a mother because that’s what my body wants, and I also want to be a young mother; I don’t want to miss that.
As for the candidate, I don’t worry.
I will give my child great feelings of happiness and raise it with a lot of love.
As far as filmmaking is concerned, keep an eye on the works you participated in and shot last year.
That is exactly the way it is, and I really want them to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman who comes from the theatre, am very impatient and restless and want to have everything at once, which of course cannot be immediately.
I very much wish that <0x60>La <0xC3><0xBA>ltima hora' and <0x60>En busca de la tumba de Cristo' will be performed for the first time.
Let's see how you like them
A couple of days ago, you appeared on the runway with Naomi Campbell, right?
It's okay, don't say that.
It’s not like I went to the treadmill to model.
Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for some time, just called me and invited me to London to attend a parade for the charity event of her organization <0x60>Women for a better world' and the clothes we show. I know that two pieces of clothing from our collection were auctioned off for Mango's own money.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
A lot of things are being told about her, and I, as the one who knows her, would tell you that she's not right.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which she is involved.
She asked me to participate in the parade for this generous cause, but when she comes and asks me to make a handstand, I will do that too.
To support women in the Third World, which is also necessary.
Drivers who can relapse due to the alcohol level will have to install the <0x60>Alcolock'.
The authority orders that the driver who had three official penalties for the alcohol level, install in his car this system, which prohibits him from starting the car in the drunken state. If he is alcoholic, then the car does not jump on.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is already part of the report of the Attorney General's Office. According to them, it is a pilot project, which will last for a year.
The purpose is the resocialization of the driver, which is why he gets a course for the re-education of traffic behavior.
In addition to the Attorney General's Office, according to experience, the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for Automobile Safety will also participate in this.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of drivers who were shown to be under the influence of alcohol more than once put themselves back on the wheel.
The ‘alcolock’ would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the exhaled air and prevents autostart if the driver has done an alcohol test; or if an alcohol concentration is detected that is higher than allowed.
It costs more than 1,000 euros, the costs are borne by the person who imposes the sanction.
In this context, a study conducted in the U.S. in 2007 has shown that cars equipped with these devices prevent up to 65% of violations in the first year after its introduction.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 lives could be saved every year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address this behavior before it becomes a criminal offence.
And in order to facilitate their implementation, a legislative reform can be implemented in the usual way, and yet a reform of the basic law is required, which is necessary for the prosecution process.
The device is still available in the Spanish markets, in no store, although it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles.
Tomorrow, the House of Representatives will be voting on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses, which has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without <0x60>peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 17:40, at the time provided by the program, next to the presidential hangar of the airport Benito Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez de México DF landed the aircraft of the Spanish Air Force, traveling with the Prince and Prince of Asturias.
The sun went down, but their rays still forced her to use her hand as a parasol to see the royal couple coming out of the plane.
Directly on the gangway: the Spanish ambassador and other authorities
A few hours ago, I had asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Prince and the Princess of Asturias were visiting the city to formalize the official trip.
- Ah, very good, so there can be no people at the airport at this time you're from here or so
No, she's a Spaniard, but she's lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, that's very good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the Prince and the Princess of Asturias are and knows the importance of the journey.
There are many waiting in the airport hangar and on the red carpet, also military protection of 27 Marines, who deliver the honor ointment.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the princess, with long windswept hair, with no ordinary ‘peep-toes’, may have been told that a thunderstorm is expected in DF.
Before they enter the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers in which the official escort is waiting.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest in the city, a reporter from Mexican television is waiting for them, who likes to joke.
The best premium of fashion
Probably there was no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there probably wasn’t a significantly outstanding fashion designer and bonvivant than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition <0x60>el B<0xC3><0xB3>ton-Mango Fashion Adwards' to promote and increase young fashion talent internationally.
This is awarded with a cash prize of 300,000 euros.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings yesterday in the shop window of the Mango branch on Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris and almost cried because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the second largest business of the company in Europe and was recently opened. It offers a sales area of 1,335 m2.
The largest store is located in London.
So many events have taken place that one would like to thank fashion designer Valentino for his chairmanship of the jury in the competition. It all ended with a luxury dinner at the Opera National de Paris.
Surrounded by many famous people, the board table organized by Mango seemed to be spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart, which was broken by the pain of his brother's death recently, tore himself apart. He put on the suit from the fashion house and put on some jewellery from ELAH that was breathtaking. He held on to the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall and has his Valentine at dinner.
Andik, the owner and master of the Mango house, greeted the guests and was such a cavalier that he ended up with the Baron of Rothschild without jackets, because they lent jackets to the ladies.
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Cruz, rushed to the store and wore a pants and a shirt, which she modeled herself, and for dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress. During a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, she showed us a room for ballet rehearsals, so she got into an agitation, she remembered
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the premises of the palace, but before she had shown us the photos of her son on the phone.
The next morning we were able to look forward to the presence of Oliver Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez, a personality who always evokes a stormy enthusiasm, and to Jon Travolta, who after his arrival (with his own sheets and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance to have a room without odors.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh la la, that's life.
1001 Advice against stress
There are not 1000, but one more way to forget about our chaotic fast-paced everyday life.
And even if there are few, they are all gathered in a book where it says how to get to relax. The book comes to the bookstores on September 30th.
The alarm clock is a punishment when it rings at 7 a.m., but even worse, the idea of getting back into the hectic rhythm that current life demands.
The office is called the tension and the computer that leads to the back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one and not two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the problems of disconnecting from the world of work.
However, the number is increasing, not more and not less than 1001.
In addition to yoga poses, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott presents in the book the entire list of options that are adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against stress is called '1001 Ways to Relax' and so the peace that the book conveys comes to the bookshops of Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Anyone who believes that it is impossible to achieve peace of mind in areas such as the workplace with the help of personal contacts, this manual refutes such a belief.
In addition, the methods of staying in contact with nature or the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation are offered.
If the adrenaline no longer rises in your veins to restore balance to the body and the stress has become a problem, then the time has come to sit on the couch, turn off the brain and focus on reading.
Talking in sleep
Some children speak at night
I do not mean those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the children who talk during sleep.
When it happens to you for the first time, at best you will be frightened, but in reality it doesn’t matter.
This is a positive sleep disorder called speaking in sleep.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
Surely, more than one of you has been told that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon can occur occasionally (once in life, for example, during high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the next day the child can remember nothing.
There is not a single reason that causes this phenomenon.
Often, associations with other phenomena in sleep are sought, such as nightmares, panic fear at night, enuresis noctura (wetting at night), talking in sleep, but there is no reason for this.
As we mentioned earlier, it can be due to very high fiber, stressful situations or overwork.
In any case, this is a little researched phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It can be that one speaks quietly in single words, whispers or it can be quite the opposite (cries, crying, long discussions ).
In cases where the utterance is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and consult with a specialist to check if there is a problem that causes anxiety and occurs in this way.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it is not treated, whether it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with sleep apnea or with stress).
What you can do is to carry out a series of simple preventive measures:
Try not to excite the child before going to sleep.
So, choose a quiet game for the child and avoid stressful TV shows that are terrible and a bit too wild.
In the nervous children who are recommended to relax, relaxation methods can be used to help them get some inner peace.
This helps the child to sleep calmly.
When talking occurs once in sleep, try to keep the calm.
Remember that it is harmless to the child and the next day he will not be able to remember anything that happened.
Helpful advices
Don't wake it.
This is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you will tear it out of sleep.
Although the child speaks, he sleeps, so he rests.
Remember, if after a couple of appearances it turns out to be frightened, then it is recommended to consult or find out why the child is afraid.
If they understand what it says (which is not so common), the child does not put pressure on them to conduct an interrogation and get more information.
So you will not be able to achieve anything with it, because when the child sleeps, it is unconscious and can not think about it.
Also, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it is dreaming and why it is saying, so be careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Perhaps, it does not tell the child that you hear it at night and know its secrets.
Not even as a joke.
This causes a lot of fear.
So don’t worry, it’s not a bad thing, it’s a moment that only takes a few minutes.
Illhouses ... finally
After a long thirsty journey, Illhäuser is finally back on track for success.
Without much effort, the yellow-blacks played out numerous shots and managed to implement one of them, and thus win the game.
The pace of this encounter, at which the attackers struggled to show their skills, was not very high.
After a first attack by the host captain Kauffmann, whose distance shot passed just at the angle, Illhäuser was to dominate the game with ease, and it was possible to alternately first Fonderflick with a distance shot, then brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the tip of the foot, the defense to challenge Denmark.
The opposing team blocked in the middle of the field and only let through the lively Riahi at the tip of the storm.
The start of the second half was to be decisive with first two goal chances fought by Riahi and Temporale, and immediately after that with the first goal for the Illhäuser by Marais, which stood exactly right to take back a ball that had been defended in a first attempt by Diebold.
But the villainous goalkeeper should not be able to enjoy his luck for long and be sent to the bank about twelve minutes later, which forced his teammates to continue playing lower in numbers.
Denmark, however, did not know how to take advantage of this and did not face a big problem for an Illhaeusian elf, who only withdrew a little to <0x60>compress' their defense, except in the very last seconds of the game, in which the ball passed very close to the lattice after a big mess.
Sarkozy Meets Angry Fishers
Before he flies to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another detour to Brittany.
In view of the resolute attitude of the fishermen who blocked access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the French president decided to meet with their representatives at the port of Guilvinec in Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re on Tuesday morning.
The latter promised to receive him “with a constructive spirit,” and hoped that he would come up with “concrete proposals.”
The President’s visit will take place at the same time as a general meeting of the Crisis Committee, which was established by the Breton fishermen to enforce measures in the face of the extreme rise in the price of diesel, which has reached a record value of over <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.14 per litre on average.
According to Elysée Palace spokesman David Martinon, “the president will discuss with them possible solutions to help their companies become competitive again, and to secure the working conditions and pay of seafarers.”
Sarkozy is expected by the fishermen with determination.
On Tuesday morning, they led protest marches in Morbihan and Calvados, which caused traffic jams of almost ten kilometers in length.
The sailing port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-<0xC3><0xAE>le did not break down.
The Quiberon peninsula was delimited by a barrier.
Already on Monday, sailors expressed their determination by burning tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient from early in the morning, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic coast and the Channel, such as Sables d<0x60>Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fishing boats did not leave, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the manoeuvres of the merchant ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique in the evening solved the blockade of the significant total refinery in Donges.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the course of the meeting on Wednesday in the ministry before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the crisis committee in Guilvinec has to decide on the reactions to the movement and on its participation in the discussion planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the heads of the National Fisheries Committee, which has not supported their movement.
“The strike will continue,” because “the fishermen will not give up at any point” and “will not go to Paris,” announced Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel currently cost about 50 cents per litre, but they believe that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.
Paul Newman the Wonderful
Butch Cassidy and the Kid died of cancer at his home in Connecticut at the age of 83.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or even Sam Mendes bid farewell to the movie legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer keeps its delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft delivered this year, despite the looming recession, to be a threat to the global economy.
Embraer, the world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, is keeping its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, its president Fredrico Fleury Curado confirmed.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects a lot from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft of the order of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider disposing of more than 15% of its assets
According to the Sunday issue of the Financial Times, the insurer American International Group, which has been financially supported by the U.S. Monetary Authority, is considering handing over more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion it was provided with.
AIG is ready to drive the sale of a large part of its business beyond its international life insurance and retirement provision in the United States.
According to the FT, the board of directors of AIG met Sunday evening to check possible sales.
No confirmation could be obtained at the AIG.
Among the assets that AIG may be separating from are its aircraft leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate assets and private equity investments.
No final decision was taken on these sales, FT continues.
AIG must make the sales as soon as possible in order to repay the loans over 85 billion that the Federal Reserve has granted it, also at the risk that the US authorities will receive 80% of their capital and the current shareholders will be lost to the same extent.
Analysis Historical Paris of the session Historical Morning-Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported on Monday, after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson’s plan to bail out banks, a historic fall in prices: The Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of nearly 800 points, and the Nasdag 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell by 777.68 points to 10,365.45 points.
As for the points, it was the strongest case in its history (684.81 points) previously recorded on September 17, 2001, the day of the trade decline following the September 11 terrorist attacks.
According to the final dropout figures, the Nasdag Index, mainly related to technology, dropped by 199.61 points to 1,983.73, and the widespread Standard&Poors 500 Index by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points.
After the unexpected rejection of the plan to rescue the banks by the Chamber of Deputies, which was supposed to allow some stability in the markets again, Wall Street collapsed, which had already been hit at the beginning of the quarter.
By 228 votes to 205, MEPs denied Finance Secretary Henry Paulson the funds he had asked for.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
“Here a bad picture is being circulated that depicts Congress as incapable of adopting a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
“This shows how much the market counted on this plan,” she added, fearing that a project “too late” would come in several days.
“If the project is indeed doomed to failure (...), it will soon be the task of the Fed (the U.S. Central Bank) and other central banks to get the crisis under control, which would further restrict credit conditions,” warned Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And Ms. Piegza stressed, emphasizing the feeling of extreme urgency even more, “that every day that passes, the ruin of a financial enterprise” in the United States “brings with it.”
Following the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, U.S. authorities planned to acquire Wachovia’s banking business from its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated, leading to emergency measures in favour of banks in the UK, the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets are facing “not just an American but a global crisis,” added the FTN Financial analyst.
The market for basic necessities has grown strongly.
Revenues of the Treasury within ten years fell Friday evening from 3.632% to 3.827%, and revenues within 30 years yesterday evening from 4.161% to 4.357%.
Obama, winner after points in first TV duel
The first debate between the two candidates for the White House on Friday was followed by another to find out who emerged as the winner, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs for the election of both Republicans and Democrats announced their own victory in this television duel, which should be pursued by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain’s performance, while quite appreciative, was not “brilliant enough” to allow him to stop his decline in polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, of which an opinion poll was published on Saturday, according to which Obama is at the top with five points (49% to 44% for McCain), is of the opinion that the Democrat is clearly making the better figure.
Among the still undecided voters, the ones that matter now, Obama emerged as the winner of the polls with 39%, while according to a CBS poll, 25% of them see McCain as the winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the good performance expected of his rival Joseph Biden at the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She's got good instincts," Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
The 70-year-old McCain did not stop to highlight his undisputed experience in the field of foreign policy, while clearly highlighting the “naivety” of his opponent regarding these issues that formed the focus of this first television duel.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand that...,” he stressed several times.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and the knowledge to become president,” he said.
A point of attack that has been preached in the Republican election commercials since yesterday.
Obama himself said he represents the future.
He spoke briefly and concisely without letting himself get out of the way.
He emphasized his ability to make good decisions and renew the image that the world has of the United States.
“McCain still doesn’t understand Obama, on the other hand,” a Democratic polling spot this weekend objected, accusing Republicans of not grasping the full extent of the crisis that burdens the “American off the street.”
“During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing to say about you,” Obama lamented yesterday in front of 20,000 people who had gathered during an election in North Carolina in a pouring rain.
He didn’t even mention the words “middle class” or “workers.” “The financial crisis gives Obama, whom Americans consider most appropriate to save the economy even on the edge of the abyss, a clear advantage.
“Next week could be a decisive turning point,” said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current crisis is “the final judgment of an eight-year bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and backed by Senator McCain.”
Having again emphasized that he would probably even manage to cut taxes for 95% of Americans despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, the Illinois Senator pointed out that creating a possible energy independence of the country and promoting renewable energies, along with introducing a health insurance system, would be a top priority.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build a plant of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates carefully avoided the questions raised by the plan to save the financial market over $700 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>470 billion), which was passed by Congress last night and is extremely unpopular with the people.
“Did you notice that an election was held in Minsk?”
Young people and opposition activists demonstrated on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital in order to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening since the closing of the polling stations in the Minsk market square to protest the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections.
Although no result had yet been announced, numerous youths had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukashenko: “The dictator should resign.”
Some admit that they didn’t choose at all: ‘What good is it if they do what they want with my voice?’ says a young woman.
They do not believe that the regime, which has shown itself in the best light to foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union, is ready to carry out a democratic turn.
Sanctions, including the non-allocation of visas to 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were deemed clean by observers.
According to the opposition, they were not.
“We were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the counting,” Yuri Potemkin, a spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, lamented to a heterogeneous association of 12 parties.
This is a cosmetic change, emphasizes Alexander Milinkievich, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-Europe movement, because it is important who counts the votes, and with us it is the executive.
If opposition MPs move into parliament, then because they were appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean broadcasting time on television, meetings in the regions and bills.'
The opposition is therefore guilty of interfering in the political game, because “dialogue with the European Union must be opened up.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, gets into a crisis and we do not reform, we run the risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
“We want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which has followed the electoral process, will not recognize the election as valid.
She emphasizes that the turnout seems too high, and that the expansion of voting in advance (26% of voters in Minsk) has paved the way for any kind of manipulation.
“Have you noticed that an election has taken place?” asks Social Democrat leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in Parliament, those who are most likely to correspond to the ideas of the government.
The silence of the night descends again over the October square.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Election Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
Conversation - From the blood that became safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its founding yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, as Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
And above all, it has regained public confidence, which had been severely shaken by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross blood donation service during the 1980s were contaminated with the HI virus and the hepatitis C virus.
In the face of this drama and public dissatisfaction, the Government of Canada launched a public inquiry in February 1994, led by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy, and to develop guidelines to prevent another such disaster.
While Judge Krever was still hesitant to submit his report, several provinces set up a committee at that time whose goal was to develop a new system for administering blood cans in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mandate.
According to reports by Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian Blood Society, to supply the other provinces and the two territories.
“In 1998, when Hema-Quebec started working, barely 38% of people had confidence in the blood-canning system in Quebec,” recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was daunting.
Through the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood cans and through work in this area over the following years, we have regained the public’s trust,” she says, before proudly stressing that in early 2008, nearly 94% of the population of Quebec now had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
However, Dr. Décary keeps in mind that “trust is something extremely fragile.”
Since its establishment on September 28, 1998, Hema-Quebec has acted on the principle of caution.
At that time we experienced the appearance of numerous cases of the human form of cattle madness in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says this woman, who has been in charge since its founding in 1998.
“And we didn’t have the slightest idea if this disease could be transmitted over the blood.
So we referred to one of the main guidelines of the reports of Krever and Gélineau, according to which one applies exclusionary measures if one does not know this and if a disease progresses only slowly, as is obviously the case with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which leads to a degeneration of the brain.
So, in April 1999, no blood was taken from people who had been in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago it was proved without a doubt that this disease is transmitted through the blood.
Thus, this event has shown us that the principle of caution that we applied makes perfect sense.
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for detecting HIV appeared on the market: the nucleic acid tests (NSTs), which allow to detect directly in the blood of the donor the presence of the virus itself, and not that of the antibodies against the virus, as was the case in the tests used so far.
The NSTs made it possible to shorten the incubation time that takes place between the time the person was infected and when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to a duration of less than a week.
Thus, the risk that certain donors could be infected without knowing it, and one could not recognize it, was significantly reduced.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of transmitting AIDS via a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of getting HIV-infected blood.
In other words, it means that you would have to distribute 12 million cans of blood before someone would be infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood cans each year, it would take more than 24 years for a case to occur in which HIV was transmitted via a blood can.
I believe that you can feel comfortable these days when you get a blood transfusion or prescribe it to restore health," says the CEO of Hema-Quebec.
“Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen can enter the system.
It was not until last year that the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Reunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted through the blood by insects.
We need to monitor continuously,” continues Dr. Décary, before emphasizing that Hema-Quebec must also provide adequate supplies in addition to a safe supply.
“Demand is rising because the population is ageing.
Because cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the blood donation network, to which on average only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation belong.
Any healthy person who is 18 years of age or older and meets the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who provide their blood are not accepted because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and those who have traveled to a country where malaria is prevalent are excluded from blood donation for one year.
“With these 3%, we are able to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Lack of supplies is very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network as they get older and can no longer donate blood.
It is difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all, to keep them and make them become regular donors.
Life today is so hectic that you rarely find the time to spend an hour donating blood,” says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec supplies not only blood cans, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin, which is used almost exclusively in severe fire injuries.
These tissues are examined, processed, and frozen before being intermediately stored at Hema-Quebec, which also manages Quebec’s only public umbilical cord blood bank.
The umbilical cord, which was previously considered biomedical waste, contains blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
“A few weeks ago we celebrated the storage of our thousandth umbilical cord blood sample, and we plan to lose more than a thousand annually.
“We should probably start making it available for transplants early next year,” explains Dr. Décary, who describes this program of umbilical cord blood loss as very popular.
“Many mothers are convinced they don’t have access to it because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and costly program in all of Quebec’s hospitals.
Soccer - Impact in the semi-finals
Montreal's Impact qualified yesterday, thanks to a 3 to 1 win (4 to 3 with all goals) against the Seattle Sounders in the second and deciding game of the quarter-final series at the Saputo Stadium, where the total goal ratio counted, for the semi-final round of the USL's first league elimination games.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the crucial goal in the ninetieth minute.
After a first half without a goal for both sides, midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other goals for the Montreal Formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who put Matt Jordan in the way for the Sounders.
Let’s remember that in the first game of the pre- and replay series on Friday Impact, the Starfire Complex in Tukwila in a suburb of Seattle had a 2 to 1 defeat.
In the semi-finals, Impact will compete with the Vancouver Whitecaps.
On Saturday evening, Thunder was able to make up a 3 to 1 deficit in the Minnesota rebound by a 4 to 3 win, but the Whitecaps still moved into the semi-final round with a total goal ratio of 5 to 4.
Impact will have to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series are set today.
In short - Victory story by Kovalev
The Canadian team’s No. 1 trio is ready to kick off the season.
Last night, the unit formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn advanced the attack on the Panthers from Florida with a storm fire, leading to a 3 to 2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec delivered two goals and Kovalev turned a pass in this victory game, the fourth of the Tricolore in six preparatory games.
Kovalev scored the victory by shooting the only goal of the entire shooting.
“I’m not ready yet,” the Russian warned.
I need another game to make me feel comfortable.”
“He’s focused too much on it in the first half,” Guy Carbonneau said.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received stormy applause."
Charest bets on the north
The prime minister does not rule out even starting elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the General Assembly of the Liberal Party was over, Jean Charest went yesterday to Jean-Talon in Quebec, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (Left) is trying to be elected in today's by-election.
'Putting the course of our last great frontier in the North': This is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented yesterday with visual means at the General Assembly of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levis, fully following the guidelines.
During his lecture, a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens, spectacular images of hydropower plants, mines, viewed from Quebec in <0x60>Google Maps', maps, etc.
A lot of money, like during the election.
The prime minister, by the way, refused to rule out holding the elections this fall, even though he made it clear that his schedule was very full.
The “Plan Nord” is the fourth element of a “vision” that the prime minister allegedly has for Quebec, namely that of a “new economic space,” which provides for an agreement with France on labor, an agreement between Canada and Europe, and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has been frequently mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches lately, the opening of the North - the northern area at the 49th latitude - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North is “a jewel with enormous potential,” but did not mention a date, investment sums, or exact priorities for the upcoming projects.
At most, some prospects for what more could be done: especially on water energy, on forests, but especially on the mining sector, favoured by the growth of emerging markets and the renewal of public infrastructures.
According to Mr. Charest's enumeration, the North has 'nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds'.
This <0x60>area twice the size of France' <0x60>is near us, is in Quebec.
It's not just near us, it's in us," he stressed, as to clearly show that he is looking to realize a national founder's dream.
Quebec has grown a lot through its connection to the north, he stressed: the road to gold in Abitibi, the technique of Quebec, the James Bay.
“It’s ours, it’s our future,” he added, after taking a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec’s territory, includes part of Labrador that Quebec has always called for, the prime minister told the press.
“This is a traditional attitude that all governments have followed.
There is a borderline on which there has been no agreement for a very long time, if the opportunity arises I will take this position again on behalf of the government," he said.
In addition, “with climate change, we need to rethink our vision from the north,” he explained, talking about the Northwest Passage, which will be navigable all year round due to the ice melt.
Given this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is almost an obligation to occupy this area.
What about the inhabitants of the area, the natives and the Inuit?
The prime minister said that the Quebec government would be very careful with them, and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pecist MP from Ungava), have already started consultations with about thirty communities.
A Committee of Ministers headed by Beno<0xC3><0xAE>t Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Land Treasures) occupies an important place, has started the work.
The prime minister does not rule out a large assembly, “not necessarily a summit,” but an opportunity where “one will create a common vision.”
The development of the North will, by the way, be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The plan will be “discussed, regulated and environmentally friendly,” he promised.
Jean Charest described this “vision” as a continuation of the liberal prime ministers who were in office before him.
“Like the Liberals who were in office before us, we have reconsidered to turn the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.
By the way, this was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a big cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s takeover of the party leadership.
One of the adopted decisions envisages renaming the Beauharnois power plant to Adélard-Godbout-Staudamm.
“From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, to Lesage, who achieved the silent revolution and the nationalization of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made James Bay, our party always knew to determine the future,” said Jean Charest.
To the press, he referred to another, this time conservative project, namely the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the Eastmain1a-Ruper dam project, Mr. Charest stresses that its commissioning is planned for 2012.
"That remains among us, but I intend to be there," he told his party members, which resulted in those cheering storms.
In fact, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly also in 2009, has not yet ruled out the possibility of holding an election this autumn, which is possible for him from the law.
He stressed, however, that his schedule is full, mainly due to a mission of the Community Council in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
This weekend’s General Assembly provided the Liberal Party leader with a platform of nationalist plans, especially of ‘constitutional goals’, which were readily adopted: the PLQ particularly calls for recognition of the ‘specialty of Quebec’ in the constitution.
She also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council, and that they have a veto over the decisions made in Quebec.
On the part of the opposition, the guidelines of the Plan Nord were adopted with skepticism.
The head of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, has brought back the policy for the development of Northern Quebec, which was introduced by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, refrained from using it.
If she had done it, “we would have been much further today,” said Marois, alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is taking place today), Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Mercure.
The ADQ has expressed its support for the adoption of a North Plan by the government.
“But what we want is that this is not just a big show,” party leader Sébastien Proulx said in a statement on behalf of Mario Dumont, who is returning from vacation today.
Letters - A disgraced country
Mr. Vic Toews, former Justice Minister (which is ironic) in Harper’s cabinet, was the one who last summer allowed himself to say about Louise Arbour that she was a “shame” for Canada.
This woman, who has waged a never-ending fight for justice and deserves all our admiration for covering up with shame, says as much about the people around the prime minister as about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing here with a government that is the only one of all the affected countries that has not brought home its compatriot trapped in the Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo concentration camp.
A government that doesn’t even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a teenager when things happened that are being accused of him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and allows a child soldier to go there under inhumane conditions.
The only one who descends to a judicial parody to assess the guilt of the accused.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association are all calling for Omar Khadr to be brought home so that he can get a fair trial in Canada.
It is this government that also closes its eyes to torture: it cares little that a young adult, after so many years of torture, will surely be mentally broken forever.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are witnessing here an insidious circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our ‘democracy’, this word that Harper constantly carries like a flag before him, and that sounds so unspeakable from his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no morality at all: you can arbitrarily abuse, torture and lock up a Canadian citizen, at the discretion of a head of government who is only supported by the minority (maybe he belongs to the minority after October 14th...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that preaches virtue, law and order, but they do not see that this government has given up on what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, lies in this renunciation, and nowhere else.
Free Speech - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
In its September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Patrick J. Garver, Deputy Director General of the Canadian Gold Mine Barrick Gold.
This confirms, and follows an Orwellian logic, that the world’s largest gold mining company sought a libel lawsuit of six million against three authors and a small, meanwhile, publishing house with the aim of opening a “public transparent debate.”
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then they do not judge on the truth, especially not in the case of libel lawsuits, but on the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely concealed by Mr Garver.
For Barrick Gold, the best way to hold a public debate is to ruin anyone who dares to represent one of their opposing opinions.
No matter how the process goes, the authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers who are paid from the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine.
The tactic in these unequal struggles is, by the way, often to ruin the defenders in order to force a consensual arrangement that puts the other side to death and also deters anyone who dares to deal with the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have had to present her views to the public.
Contrary to what is, going on and going on in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are usually held by exchanging ideas and not by squabbling.
So it would have been enough if the gold mine had unveiled its books and files and opened up a real debate, through the newspapers, media, publications and the funding of independent investigative teams that could have brought light to this issue.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and wipes out the petitions and letters in support of the authors of Noir Canada with a hand gesture.
Could Mr. Garver perhaps explain how he can at the same time ask for a “public” debate while disregarding the opinions of this public?
Apparently, this word in the world of the Vice President includes only the generously paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a very narrow view of the term.
In a democracy, even slanderers have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn’t understand – or doesn’t want to understand – is that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does this primarily because it rejects the brutal stance of the gold mine.
This public is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many perceive as a gag complaint (in the course of the ‘public debate’ Barrick Gold has just filed a claim to the authors of Noir Canada, in which they no longer use them).
Aside from Mr. Garver’s surreal speech, Barrick Gold’s lawsuit is a direct attack on the freedom to pursue academic research and truthfinding that are fundamental to any democratic society.
It completely denies the right to cite credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to explore and discuss issues that the rich companies of this world do not like, who else can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could lead it by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment to which we belong has long known how to deal with debates and disagreements and how to resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s disproportionate lawsuit clearly shows that, contrary to what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate, and it is time for governments to take action to limit this kind of unjustified lawsuit.
Wall Street Rescue Action - Democrats and Republicans Understand Each Other
The Bush administration and senior congressmen, Republicans and Democrats alike, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most comprehensive economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan to stop the financial crisis that has been rocking Wall Street for months has yet to be approved by both Houses of Congress.
The main contents are: better control of MEPs on the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of the public funds used, new provisions to curb the number of houses seized due to defaults, as well as the right to monitor the salaries supported to the executives.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, and Republican Representative Judd Gregg, present at the negotiations, announced the good news yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, after a two-day negotiating marathon.
"We have made great progress towards a deal that will be market-effective," Bush administration spokesman Henry Paulson said in a statement.
“Everything was done to protect the real economy and the American people from the price crisis on Wall Street,” she said.
“This is the fundamental point: if we don’t do that, the trauma, chaos and unrest in the daily lives of Americans will be enormous,” said Republican Judd Gregg.
Negotiations had accelerated over the past two hours, fearing the impact a new failure would have had on investor sentiment.
The deadline that had been agreed was the opening of the market this morning.
The two U.S. presidential candidates, who were only late in the negotiations, were more likely to be proponents of the agreement, without failing to express their dissatisfaction with the need to meet them in this extreme way.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama insisted on the addition of certain provisions of agreement, especially those that would allow owners to keep their homes, and those that affect the salaries of executives of state-saved companies.
“When you ask taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of certain people, that is not something you could congratulate yourself on.
But these measures are necessary," he said on American television.
When asked on another channel if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: “I’d like to know the details first, but I hope so.
“The guidelines I’ve read [show] that this is something that we’re all going to have to digest, and that we’re going to be able to move forward with.
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable,” he said.
The $700 billion plan is aimed at using taxpayers’ money
It comes 14 months after a crisis triggered by the placement of a real estate bubble that initially led to the collapse of high-risk mortgage loans (subprime) before expanding to other forms of distributed bond (PCAA), and eventually leading to a freeze of financial power and the ruin of banks and monetary institutions.
It was a group of Republican lawmakers who failed their first attempt at unity last week.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain “toxic” assets of societies in distress should only be secured by the government and not bought, it is believed to escape the deadlock.
To round out the viewpoints for everyone in Congress, a decree has also been added that if the government were to make losses with this program within five years, it could then levy new taxes in order to recover its invested capital.
The new plan foresees the payment of a first sum of 250 billion, to which an additional 100 billion can be added if the president deems it necessary.
The payment of another $350 billion must be passed by Congress in a re-vote.
In return for his help, Washington receives shares in the supported company, which pay him dividends in the event of profits, and which he can sell again when the storm has passed.
The Federal Government will have the option of suspending the detention proceedings in respect of the apartments linked to the real estate loans affected by this plan, as well as setting deadlines for repayment and settlements to be paid to the executives of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the Chamber of Deputies to vote on it today, and the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will get the green light.
In fact, more votes rose yesterday against this project, both from the Republicans and the Democrats.
“Obviously Washington doesn’t understand us,” Republican Scott Garett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told his constituents.
“Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that consists in asking the taxpayers to pay the cash."
Democratic MP Brad Sherman, leader of a group in Congress called “the caucus of the skeptics,” presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred distinguished economics professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us to tell us: We ask Congress not to be pressured and to carefully consider which way to go,” he said.
At the same time, we have once again received proof in Europe that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would refrain from buying up its competitor, which has been in great trouble since it lost 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) in the crisis due to the United States’ high-risk real estate.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the top 20 European banks and ten largest insurers.
"This is not lost money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said.
To compensate, we get a right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what the savers and households appreciate now that uncertain times are heralding.”
During this time, on the other side of the English Channel, the British government was just about to nationalize another bank distressed by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all current loans from Bradford and Bringley Bank, including over 41 billion (75.5 billion dollars) from real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
After Northern Rock, Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank the UK government has had to nationalise since the start of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a committed icon
His beauty with the azure eyes was for a long time his trump, no one would say his weakness.
Had the American actor freed himself from the narcissistic mirror with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His finesse, sensitivity and obvious talent have probably kept him away from a position of power that brings the truly terrible monsters into the world.
But what a great runner!
Paul Newman, who died of lung cancer on his ranch in Connecticut on Friday at the age of 83, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and for whom he was for a long time a kind of rival on the screen, more careful in his acting, certainly also more fragile, but equally an apostle of freedom and the bursting of dramaturgical conventions.
Mixed blood often results in wonderful children.
He was born in 1925 in Ohio as the son of a German Jew and a Hungarian mother.
From its European roots should emerge one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, extreme quality feature.
Because in him, an entire country that was in love with the self-made man was reflected, in the fighter who was injured in battle in the Pacific War, who studied acting at Yale in the early 1950s and then visited the Actor's Studio in New York before he had success in theater, on television and soon in cinema.
This man, who fought for civil rights, was also the driver who became Man's second in the 24-hour race in 1979, and also a sex symbol, although he lived in a show relationship with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him also disappear the unknown facets of this mysterious, reserved, committed and over-sensitive star, whose mysteries will never be completely solved.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newmans moved film lovers to Taumel this weekend, while on the dark screen of memories all his great roles were played.
More than half a century of ever-changing American film art is moving with him.
Then the charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) comes back to mind, and the young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the Hot Tin Roof, which was filmed in 1958 by Tennessee Williams.
There will be a much shorter recollection (1990) awakening to his sensitive Mr. Bridge, who is disturbed at his old age by a wedding that did not fulfill all his promises.
There have been so many other Paul Newmans throughout history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me (A Hand Full of Dirt) by Robert Wise, a role that was intended for James Dean, who was re-recorded after his death and made the Newman well known in 1956.
This sympathetic Ganove in the superb The Sting (The Clou), which was awarded the Oscar for Best Picture in 1973.
As a bitter and vengeful billiard player in the wonderful The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961),
This face through the ages, that was him.
It's still him.
In his CV, epochs come together.
He is best known for his role in George Roy Hill's cult film Slap Shot (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the unorthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With a final role in 2003 as the godfather of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes, the circle closed.
Unlike several movie legends who retired early enough from the film world, Newman was supposed to stay in the saddle for a long time, betraying Hollywood, his fortune, his pruning and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to <0x60>underplaying' when he judged his overly expressive performances.
The meter was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the scrolls flew for a long time.
However, he rarely played Sunnyboys as an outsider: neurotic, alcoholic, fiesling or desperate, with whose perfect portrayal he reflected his slipping and his rebellion.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown aspects of his true sensitive sensibility.
His 1968 Rachel (after the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a delicate women's portrait full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott to an overdose, dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son, a work full of finesse and sadness.
In the flood of honors that poured out on Newman yesterday, his close friend and former comrade in arms Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said: "His presence has improved my life and this country."
Generosity and joy of life were essential characteristics of the deceased actor.
Apart from his legendary career, he is now also a great advocate of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of Hollywood’s drift.
We have often seen him standing with his foot in bowls full of vinaigrette, in sauces, pastries or other foods, and this was considered rather tasteless, although we still found it funny at first.
However, the profits from his sales flowed into his Foundation for Children in Need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman committed himself to the shot.
He left his five daughters a letter with these sentences: ‘Always and to the very end your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here.”
And for us, it was an honor to be allowed to pursue the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the narrowest and broadest sense.
What was produced in the invoice factory by Zuschlag &amp; Co.?
On October 8, negotiations in the criminal trial against J<0xC3><0xA1>nos and his accomplices begin.
In particular, the accused are accused of involvement in organized crime, gross negligence and business fraud, and other criminal offences - including forgery of documents.
According to the prosecutor's office, the funds looted from the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often covered with fake invoices.
State funds and subsidies from the self-government - a total of HUF 65 million - are to be flowed partly into the treasuries of the organization Fiatal Baloldal, partly into the private treasuries of individuals.
As the investigative authorities have announced, fictitious invoices have been submitted for the receipt of tender money, and the associations are not supposed to have complied with their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the bills were forged.
The bill blocks were bought at the market of J<0xC3><0xB3>zsefv<0xC3><0xA1>ros, the round seal was made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies are to be issued the invoices was decided on that round trip north of Lake Platt, to which Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados was sent by J<0xC3><0xA1>nos.
In the course of this "exploration tour" Lados should find pensions and restaurants.
He requested bills on consumption in order to be able to issue later bills for the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the self-government of Budapest based on these templates.
These bills are said to have been manipulated by the majority of Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados and his accomplice, Andr<0xC3><0xA1>s <0xC5><0x90>ri, the latter according to our information being responsible for the constitution of the corresponding reports.
One of the goals of Lados' "exploration tour" was a beer place.
As can be seen from two invoices issued by Zuschlag and Co in 2003, the gastronomy company is said to have hosted the 90-member group of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
But now the head of the company indicates that such a large group would not have fit into the room at once.
Another bill, issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért, also showed serious errors in form and content.
In a guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and can accommodate no more than ten people at the same time, 130 guests are said to have stayed.
The imagination of the counterfeiters was apparently no more limited than that of Pigal Kft., a gastronomic company, in whose accounts the records of the customers Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért and Hopp<0xC3><0xA1> do not appear at all, according to the prosecution.
As CEO Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas told hvg.hu, he was immediately aware that these were fake documents when he was presented with documents by the prosecution during an interrogation.
"Our company name and tax number were incorrectly affixed on the stamp".
And further: Apart from form errors, the fact that the company is said to have housed a hundred people was also wrong, after they have a total of eleven rooms that are impossible to accommodate so many people.
Food was also mentioned on the invoice, while the restaurant was no longer in operation for a long time.
The emissary forgers have also failed to verify that the Budapest travel agency targeted by them exclusively offers travel abroad, and so they have indicated Hungary travel on the cash payment invoice, which was also contrary to the accounting practice of the company.
As the investigation revealed, they also cited VAT on the invoices, although travel agency services related to a country outside the EU are exempt from VAT.
The amount of VAT was incorrect on four invoices issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation, as the company instead of 25 only accounts for 15 percent of VAT, in addition, only machine invoices are issued by the employees, but the forged documents were handwritten.
Another mistake that the "accountants" made was that in one case they had indicated "goods transport" as a service provided, although this is not offered by the firm specializing in investment consulting, the prosecutor's office said.
Further form flaws - wrong invoice format, wrong stamp - were due to the fact that the invoices issued to Együtt a Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny, as well as to XXI. Sz<0xC3><0xA1>zadi Kultur<0xC3><0xA1>lis Egyesület and Biztos Pont could be exposed as counterfeits.
Similarly, in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the Kunfehért<0xC3><0xB3> sports camp, whose managing directors confirmed that they had never issued the invoices.
Another "error" is to be overcome by the counterfeiters at the HIB Kft. from Ny<0xC3><0xAD>regyh<0xC3><0xA1>za: this company was in disintegration at the time (2001), when the group of the Fiatal V<0xC3><0xA1>rosért Egyesület was supposed to have eaten there - the mass administrator therefore stated that they did not issue the bills themselves.
Consciously Fake
The other group of accountants are people who were quite aware that they would have to make fictitious invoices.
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifj<0xC3><0xBA> Szocialist<0xC3><0xA1>k, the Esély Budapestért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny Foundation has issued invoices for the Együtt a Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Foundation, amounting to approximately HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the managing director of the Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the fictitious invoices.
The Biogate Kft., which is also currently in liquidation, is also said to have cooperated with Procurement and Co.: In 2003, the Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny Foundation, as well as the associations Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfeny<0xC5><0x91> Egyesület, are to have acquired the total value of HUorg 5 with counterfeit invoices.
However, there was just as little payment traffic, as the invoices were cancelled immediately after their issuance, but the affected parties forgot to note in their documents.
The third group of accountants includes persons who are directly connected with the accused.
One of them is Ivan Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3> Kft., a Budapest-based but untraceable fuel and vehicle trading company.
This company is said to have issued several invoices for the sale of computer components in the total value of approximately HUF 18 million in the period from October to December 2005.
According to the investigating authority, Cash Investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, is said to have acted as a buyer of these invoices.
The managing director of this company was a Romanian, to whom the company documents should also be delivered by Ivan Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, during the investigation, Kubatov admitted to issuing invoices on behalf of the GmbH. to the associations Atlasz and Hopp<0xC3><0xA1>, as well as to Együtt a Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny and to having cashed their equivalent themselves.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and the Jos-Investment Bt. are said to have been founded by Romanian masons at the express request of Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n Kubatov.
In truth, however, none of these companies were active, which, according to the accused, was due to a lack of orders.
Nevertheless, he was able to benefit from the companies: At the request of his accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was in charge of preparing the company's founding documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with the contract, such as Atlasz and Y-Gener<0xC3><0xA1>ci<0xC3><0xB3>.
In total, Kubatov is said to have issued 15 invoices totalling HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3>, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organizations.
The prosecutor’s office assumes that Kubatov could have collected 10% of the invoice amount as well as the VAT.
Kubatov is said to have even misused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the exhibition of fictitious invoices - in this case, the invoices were appended to the applications of Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, Y-Gener<0xC3><0xA1>ci<0xC3><0xB3> and Szovetség a Modern Magyarorsz<0xC3><0xA1>gért submitted their applications to the non-profit organization of the Socialist Party, T<0xC3><0xA1>ncsics Mih<0xC3><0xA1>ly Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny ("TMA").
Both received 500,000 forints each, but used these amounts for other purposes.
To cover up this, they submitted five fictitious invoices from Works Team Kft. to the TMA.
By the way, these invoices were secured during the search of the office of <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d Kemecsei in the Ministry of Education.
During the negotiations, some of the defendants are now counting on a confession about the procedure of forgery, as they were already filed before the prosecutor's office.
A sensation could be if the main defendant J<0xC3><0xA1>nos decides to make a full confession.
His previous statements were less detailed, and although he had already promised to report everything in detail several times, his confession is still pending.
The question remains, therefore, whether this is in his interest, whether the Socialists have concluded a pact with him with regard to the reparation of the majority of the resulting damage of HUF 50 million, and whether the subsidy in return is willing to assume responsibility.
However, it is quite possible that the surcharge now plays the "offended" after his requests for relieving the detention and house arrest had been met with deaf ears.
While other criminals who have done far greater damage with economic offences and have not repaid them, are at large, or at least under house arrest, surcharge remains denied this possibility.
The Psychology of Surrender – or Why We’re Ready to Pay More
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more and thus overestimate the wrong bid.
Neurologists and economic researchers at the University of New York have now been able to discover the neurological and economic foundations of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the "Science" magazine, people do not want to give themselves up in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, and are therefore willing to pay even excessive prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers was supposed to play lotto, while the other participated in a playful action - in both cases, the subjects' active brain regions were examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
In both games, participants were able to win money, but increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the cerebral cortex, was measured in losers of the auction, in which overtaking the opponent plays a significant role.
In addition to many other functions, this region of the brain is responsible for the "self-reward" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore believed that the price increase could be explained by avoiding an overreaction of the striatum.
In order to support their thesis, the economists in the research group have additionally hired research to track the money.
In this case, three groups should offer against a partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product, after which they made their bets.
Another group was also promised a $15 reward in case they emerged as winners from the game.
The third group received $15 before the auction, which was also lost in the event of a lost game.
So the difference between the two groups was simply that the emphasis on one was on winning, while the other was on losing.
As evidence of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, however, the members of the "against losing" group were prepared to make higher bets than those in the control or "gain" group.
“These results cannot be derived from any previous economic theory.
These have, in fact, justified the behaviors observed at auctions so far only with the joy of winning, or risk avoidance.
The contradiction between these two theories has been resolved thanks to the imaging neurological procedures, so we have now prepared a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When to see a doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of infected is estimated at one hundred thousand in this country, but only seven thousand are treated, due to the fact that patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for infectious liver diseases caused by various viruses.
The symptoms are often similar - inflammation of the liver and jaundice are common, but the pathogens and diseases differ from each other.
Depending on the pathogen, the hepatitis viruses spread in two different ways: in hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example through contaminated food or water), in hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted through blood and other body fluids (such as sperm, vaginal secretions or saliva).
Travelers are advised to get vaccinated against viruses A and B, but there is no vaccine against virus C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear about two to three weeks after eating the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by discomfort, weakness, abdominal pain and refractory stimuli.
After that, jaundice occurs on the skin and in the eyes, the stool becomes light, the urine dark, and recovery can take up to two to three weeks.
Every year around 1 million people worldwide die from hepatitis B-related, far more serious diseases such as liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that according to estimates, only one in ten infected people is in drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: untreated it can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, as the pathogen insidiously destroys the liver cells - in many cases, the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular check-ups, is essential.
There are three groups in which this disease is more common: those who underwent a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattooists.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide is estimated at 200 million.
Since the disease is already detectable in a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to see a doctor at the first signs of unknown origin.
Timely recognized, the disease is curable, the virus can be eradicated, thereby banishing the risk of infection and preventing the formation of cancer.
September 30th is the World Hepatitis Day, held for the first time in 2004 by patient representatives worldwide.
The aim of the action is to raise awareness of this chronic liver inflammation caused by viruses, their emergence and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
Recent research shows that religious faith acts as a kind of "pain-remedie" that has already facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment: It has been studied to what extent belief in God influences the pain of man, reported the British newspaper "Telegraph".
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists each received electroshocks while studying a painting of the Mother of God.
As the results showed, the believers were able to turn off most of the pain.
Using a brain scan technology, it was even proven that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for pain regulation.
The study was the first in a research project in which, in addition to scientists, philosophers and theologians from different departments of the university participated.
During the experiment, a sparkling device was attached to the left hand, which gave off the electric shocks.
Participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: one a picture of the Mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and the other Leonardo da Vinci's "Lady with the Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would evoke a kind of religious trance among the faithful, while they chose da Vinci’s image, because it was hardly different from the other painting and was perceived as reassuring.
The subjects spent half an hour each in an MRI scanner, and during that time received a total of 20 electroshocks in four stages while viewing either the religious or the other painting.
The Catholics reported that they felt “safe” at the sight of the Mother of God as if they were “cared for” and felt “rest and peace.”
While looking at the religious painting, they reported about 12% less pain than if they had Leonardo’s work in mind.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, said that similar effects could also be caused with other, strongly acting images also in the atheists, you just need to find the corresponding photo.
“We would have to find an image that triggers very positive sensations, such as a mother or a father,” says the psychologist.
The Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
“Practicing the faith should change our personality, and does so in many cases,” Wright said.
After these excellent results, all that remains is the question of what effect a Madonna image of Leonardo or another comparable painter would have on the pain regulation of the faithful.
Would the high-quality Virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On the occasion of her tenth birthday, Google can rightly claim that she can be found in people’s pockets as well as above their heads in the sky: she knows where people have spent their holidays, what specialists they go to, and what moves them.
And that’s still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the CEOs of Google.
In the direction of skeptics who are plagued by Orwellian horror visions, he says: These would just overlook the essence of Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times recently, Schmidt said Google’s main goal was to collect even more personal data about users and get closer to the company’s original goal of “ordering all the information in the world.”
Schmidt said that after ten years of world-changing work, Google is still only at the beginning of information collection.
Asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said: he wished that Google would be able to answer questions like “What should I do tomorrow?” or “What job really suits me?”, but software programs were not yet able to do so because they did not know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that search terms, the IP addresses from which they were searched and the pages visited would be recorded in the course of their Internet searches.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to save his own search history and later to use it, so that the results can be generated much more accurately later, and on the same logic are also based the so-called "Recommendations", with which the system recommends customized products and services based on the earlier.
However, users wonder what happens in the event of a data breach - "If you look at what I'm doing" - some are worried about Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is rather the potential power represented by the company that is fear-inducing, and less the feeling of guilt or fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom, or the rise against the power that many Internet users encounter in rejection.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored, but also passed on to third parties, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A prime example of this was recently the anti-pedophilia action in Brazil, in which Google provided the Brazilian government with information collected by the community site called "Orkut" and also made it possible to identify the pedophilia.
However, users concerned about personal rights were still able to breathe in May, when Google, together with the civil rights organization EFF, successfully sued the FBI: therefore, Google can not be forced to release information to the FBI on secret request with any point of the Constitution in the future.
(However, the federal government has successfully obtained the issue of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms with reference to the Youth Protection Act passed years ago, but the list of individual users, or their web and search term lists, has been withheld from it retroactively for two months.)
So Google’s image remains controversial: Those who reluctantly release their personal data because they fear the loss of their privacy and intimacy through the use of Google services are scolding the company with the outrage due to the conservative companies.
However, the American "geek culture" that is present in many countries and unites enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, sees the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, unlike Microsoft, which is the market leader thanks to Windows, even if both are fighting for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that, unlike Microsoft, Google does not require its users to use identification codes, and its services are provided free of charge, making an open, constantly updated source code and program package seem far more attractive, youthful, and cooler than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, the geeks look at the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet – a relationship that has become the focus of attention, especially in recent years, thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
The "Web 2.0" is about nothing but collaboration, that is, users deliberately leave traces and use the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions are individually different, the main thing remains the same, namely to show themselves publicly.
An average teenager can manage their profile on several community portals at the same time - from Facebook to Xanga, can connect them through other services, such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can eventually integrate all this into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm.
And a number of other exemplary cases proves: when looking at the party photos of last night, the girlfriend soon finds out who her unfaithful friend has had fun with, or the employee is fired because in his blog he is only too honest about his annoyance about the running of the company - one thing is for sure: the term "Prirevat" has become more
Anyone who leads an online life is what he dictates of himself - in this way, for example, one could formulate the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth.
And anyone who tries to keep something secret, or even bypass the Google monopoly, can do so – as with Scroogle, a tool that accesses Google’s search engine, but intentionally leaves no trace.
Not a few people intentionally don’t register on community sites so they can’t be found, but Google’s online applications, such as word processing and graphical tools and RSS feeds, can also be handled with alternative versions that aren’t tied to huge server parks and therefore don’t generate the best user profile possible.
Public opinion, however, is eagerly waiting for Google to show its true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), the ad space of AdWords/AdSense threatens the revenues of advertising agencies, and the increasingly fast-implemented services Koper is not only preparing software for others, but also Microsoft.
Critical observers, however, also find the disturbing counter-pole: for example, the management of the company has completely rejected a protest of the employees after the fees of the company's own kindergarten were doubled, in addition, the management thought that the multiple meals of the employees was too expensive. All this was a year in the face of the government, but this was all too mild in Google's eyes.
The internal regulation of the group is that in advance no new service will be advertised, but only if this is already available. Nevertheless, the events of the coming months and years could again be very powerful: while some of my, Google's book and magazine scan or archiving project, the court is now taking the most out of the system, so much of the company's
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database is already supplying the next generation of sci-fi authors with the stuff - such as "Scroogled", the famous novel by Cory Doctorow describes in the best Orwellian way a future in which a person becomes frighteningly close thanks to data obtained from Google.
Two teenagers help <0xC3><0x93>zd's double murderer remove traces
In connection with the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd, the police have now interrogated two young people suspected of helping to remove the traces, a spokesman for the Borsod police station said on Tuesday.
The young people were constantly, they are currently being accused of aid.
According to the MTI news agency, these are two girls who defend themselves on their own.
The aid is threatened with a prison sentence of up to five years.
The suspect in the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd, a 23-year-old local man, was taken into custody on Sunday.
The man is under urgent suspicion of having intentionally murdered several people out of greed for money.
The investigation revealed that the 23-year-old owed a larger sum of money to a 53-year-old.
However, the suspect did not want to pay his debts, so he lured his creditor to an estate in <0xC3><0x93>zd last Wednesday, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man planned the act long-term - this also proves the fact that he committed the murders with a weapon hidden at the scene.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the actual weapon and the circumstances of its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange Offers Buying Offer for Prague Stock Exchange
About 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech crowns, has been offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the 100 percent purchase of the stock packages of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, reaffirmed the offer that the Poles had made despite the fact that they were previously excluded from the Czechs as possible owners of their stock exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange belongs entirely to the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wants to sell more than 60% of the shares in the coming months.
According to reports from the Czech daily newspaper "E15", the offer of the Poles includes the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
As the newspaper reports, the Vienna Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have so far placed offers.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that of all the interested parties, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would probably be the worst new owner, and he did not rule out that this could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders’ agreement, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25 percent stake, followed by Cesk<0xC3><0xA1> Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
In their comments devoted to the increasingly escalating international financial crisis on Tuesday, some leading European newspapers already spoke of "the second of September 11".
The global financial disaster we owed to the American president, for example, said "La Repubblica" - the president was not even able to turn his own party for the bill into one that should bring some relief to the frightening situation...
Instead of a “new Pearl Harbor,” as billionaire investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a “second 9/11.”
Parts of the press in Madrid also place the scapegoat in Washington.
According to the “El Mundo”, the lack of political leadership is due to the fact that the world economy is now on the verge of collapse.
The American financial system is increasingly threatening to collapse, and the whole world will suffer from it.
Although Bush’s plan was not perfect, now after the vote in Congress, there is a danger that Washington does not have a political means to manage the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the air at a time when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, according to the Geneva "Days-Indicator".
While some states could still provide bailout packages to their failing financial institutions, and save banks from bankruptcy with taxpayers’ money.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and more banks go bankrupt, then neither further financial injections nor other immediate measures will help.
In the long term, EU Member States would have to jump over their shadows and centralise control over the money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion was paid out to weakening financial institutions, the Viennese "The Standard" recalls. Moreover, the newspaper continues, the concerns are increasingly realistic that after the Americans, European taxpayers would now also have to go a little deeper into their pockets to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not dealt seriously with the crisis, which is now sweeping across the old continents like a tsunami.
While the “saviors” would not have to “wedge” immediately with several hundred billion euros, it would be advisable to state in which case it would be reasonable to take the taxpayers’ money to avert an even greater damage.
Smart car mimics Hummel's flight
What would be the best method to develop new technologies for accident avoidance if not to mimic the obstacle sensors from nature?
For example, the bees.
At CEATEC in Japan, an amazing project was presented, in which Nissan Hummeln engineers were inspired to create new accident-preventing systems.
In collaboration with Tokyo University, Nissan has built the autorobot-driven BR23C biomimetic system, a mini-car equipped with the characteristics of bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In flight, each bee forms its own, oval "private area", which is very similar to our own "protective shield", said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, at the exhibition.
The composite eye of the bee, which can see in any direction and at an angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role in this.
In order to mimic the function of the composite eye, the researchers approached the idea of the laser-controlled spacer.
It identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C in a 180-degree field of view within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor on board, which immediately initiates the collision avoidance process.
The obstacle is recorded in fractions of a second, and the autorobot immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of the bees, by rotating the tires around the corresponding angle.
Unlike previous systems, this maneuver takes place purely instinctively.
“If it were not, the autorobot could not react quickly enough to evade the hurdles,” said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the autorobot project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer within which accidents are currently considered to be inevitable.
The whole process must reflect the behavior of the bees when they dodge other bees.
And that has to happen in a fraction of a second.
However, evasion, unlike bees, can not take place up, down, or even diagonally - it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction of the reversibility of the tires.
While there are infinite possibilities for the bees to avoid other bees, the researchers were only able to use the rotary movement, or acceleration and braking, in the autorobot.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy efficient, and therefore have a longer service life than conventional lithium ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it depends on the instinctive, intelligent response, and less on the processing of the data, and even less on the ability to store it.
This device only has to process a few inputs per second and respond accordingly.
It doesn’t have to store them, or produce an intuitive, logical response based on previous maneuvers, so that it continuously uses only a handful of KB memory.
There is no need for gigabyte and megabyte-heavy memories.
This is the first step in the development of the immediate collision avoidance technology, which Nissan estimates will be in production as standard over the next ten years.
Another application could find the technology in GPS satellite navigation by consciously steering the driver around obstacles and thus leading him to his destination.
A Name for the Sinful Child
Now there is a written version of the $700 billion bailout bill, which will be applied in several stages and aimed at buying the bad loans of the banks.
In the first passage, half of the money will be spent.
In a meeting that ended after midnight on Saturday at East Coast local time, congressmen broke through after several days of debates over an agreement on the $700 billion bailout package, Reuters reported.
“We’ve made significant progress,” said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, who said the deal should only be brought to paper.
The compromise reached on the bailout package was supported by both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson said that the program will be effective and efficient, but more needs to be done, and that it was not about saving Wall Street, Pelosi said, but about tearing down the rudder of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e., Washington time on Sunday evening at 8 a.m. (Central European time on Monday 2 a.m.), but has not triggered an upward flight on the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives first votes on the 2008 bill to stabilize the economy, then the Senate is up.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday night, and the White House also welcomed the news of the deal.
"We are pleased with the progress made overnight and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
The program, however, deviates from the Bush administration’s original recommendation that the $700 billion should be spent on buying lazy, credit-laden securities at once.
In a first instalment, a maximum of half of the $700 billion is to be spent, with $250 billion immediately available after Congress is expected to vote on the cause on Monday. This sum is to be spent on the purchase of credit-laden, bad securities, and on the president's $100 billion decision.
The program is reviewed by its own committee, which is also consulted by the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the $700 billion depends on another congressional decision.
In the sense of the law, the Ministry of Finance can also apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy bad loans, mortgages, and mortgage-laden securities, or other "toxic" loans.
As the competent persons of the Ministry reported, the purchase can be made both in an auction and directly.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program in which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the funds of concern, and the companies pay the corresponding fees for the damage to be expected.
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary funds in such a way that up to $700 billion can be made available as emergency aid to the American financial system, whether it is for the large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or the avoidance of a systemic risk triggered by the collapse of a larger financial institution.
We are taking the necessary steps so that we are ready to introduce the law as soon as it is signed, Paulson said.
However, the heads of banks in difficulty and now dependent on state aid can count on the government to cut down on their settlements, which are called "Golden Handshake" in the overseas slang salopp.
There will be a reduction in wages only in certain cases, and these reductions will depend on how the Ministry of Finance assists in each case.
The reduction essentially means that if the Ministry purchases as part of an auction, the "Golden Handshake" is taxed, unless the outgoing bank manager is deported to retirement.
In the event of a direct purchase of the lazy loans, the government will aggressively engage to ensure that the manager’s salaries are not exaggerated.
The image also includes that the existing Golden Handshake contracts are not changed - the restrictions only relate to new agreements, so that more people participate in the program.
This is the first case in U.S. history that cuts in manager salaries are regulated by law, commented Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Finance Committee, the measure.
The state gains participation rights in the participating banks, so that the risk to taxpayers decreases, as they can also participate once the economy and thus the rescued bank recovers.
The bill requires the president to submit a proposal to Congress over the next five years on how taxpayers should get their lost money back from the financial sector.
However, there were skeptics on both sides who expressed doubts about the plan.
That’s not what American citizens expect from us, the plan will not protect taxpayers’ money at all, according to California Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said: “The measures were driven by the same people who are also responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continue to rise
According to the Central Statistical Office, domestic sales prices rose by 0.1 percent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, and compared to August 2007, by 12.9 percent.
Export prices were 1.1 percent higher than in July 2008 and fell by 3.9% compared to the previous year.
Due to price changes in the domestic and export sectors, production prices were 0.7% higher than in the previous month, and 3.2% higher than in 2007.
Domestic sales prices have only slightly increased compared to the previous month, i.e. by 0.1 percent.
Sales prices of the manufacturing industry also rose only slightly - 0.1 percent - since July.
The biggest price increase in August 2008 was for leather goods (2.8 percent) - primarily bags and belts - where the increase was 4.6 percent, while for shoes prices went up by 2.5 percent.
Higher prices for plastics and chemical raw materials pushed prices for chemicals and production significantly up (1.6 percent).
Price declines were recorded in crude oil processing (1.4 per cent), in electrical and technical equipment (0.9 per cent), and in wood processing (0.1 per cent).
The prices in paper production, as well as in publishers and in the printing industry remained unchanged.
In other branches of the manufacturing industry, a price increase of between 0.2 and 0.9 percent was measured.
In the major domestic sales markets of the industry, such as electricity, gas, steam and water, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, primarily as a result of the gas price increase introduced on July 1.
If you look at the domestic sales markets of the manufacturing industry in the year-on-year comparison, prices in crude oil processing have risen the most (32.4 percent).
In the metalworking sector, a 13.2% increase was observed, while the increase in the production of food, beverages, and tobacco was 11%.
A decrease in prices was observed in the textile industry (2.5 percent) and in electrical and technical equipment (0.3 percent).
Expenditure in the other processing industries ranged from 0.6 to 9.1 percent.
Overall, prices in the manufacturing industry rose by 10.2 percent last year.

On the domestic market, the highest price increase was recorded in August in the investment goods sector (0.7 percent).
In the manufacturing sectors for consumer goods, prices rose by 0.3 percent, while they remained the same in the energy and further processing sector compared to the previous month.
The biggest increase in prices in August 2008 was observed in the energy and re-use sector (16.8 per cent) compared to the comparison period of 2007.
In the sectors producing consumer goods, there was a price increase of 6.8 per cent, while there was a price decrease of 1.4 per cent for investment goods.
The export prices of the industry measured in Forint increased by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, but there was a decrease of 3.9 percent in comparison with the previous year.
The domestic currency weakened by 1.7 percent compared to the euro, the dollar by 7.1 percent, and compared to the exchange rate of August 2007, it became stronger by 7.5 percent compared to the euro, with the dollar even by 15.9 percent.
No more visas to the U.S. from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good chances that the U.S.-Hungarian visa agreement will enter into force around January 12, as the foreign minister told representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
“It all depends on whether the electronic immigration or control system is implemented in time.”
But she also stressed that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but tourists would have to register in advance.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy is holding talks in Washington today.
She meets Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will hand her the "Middle Cross of Merit with a Star" of the Republic of Hungary, and she also holds talks with the foreign policy advisers of Democrat Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support bailout for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major American parties, pledged their support for the $700 billion bailout package for banks on Sunday, but there are also politicians calling for the finance minister’s resignation.
Congress and government officials have announced after days of marathon consultations on Sunday morning that they have reached an agreement on the bank bailout package.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the devastation of the frozen credit market, became the central issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain both claim to be better suited than their respective opponents to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent polls, Obama was able to further expand his lead thanks to economic issues, while McCain’s high, which gave him the presentation of Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention, has melted away.
At an election campaign event in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed hope that Congress will quickly pass the $700 billion package bill.
He stressed that the plan also includes those passages of consumer protection that he has supported.
“We need to act now, and responsibly ... your jobs, your savings, entire industries, and the stability of the entire economy are under threat,” he told 35,000 spectators.
He has not failed to call McCain’s economic visions “obsolete.”
In an interview with ABC, McCain said, "We're all going to have a hard time doing this ... but not doing it is definitely not an alternative."
The Republican senator said the plan also prescribes the establishment of a control committee for the finance minister, as well as the restriction of processing for top managers — something he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not play a definitive role in the negotiations, whereas he, Obama, was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the House of Representatives will probably vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking area
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters became more confident within the camp - so "Der Spiegel" comments on the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to govern to prevent a red-black coalition.
The Mirror (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bavarian Revolution destroys their fathers".
According to the renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took over.
The Christian socials have renewed Bavaria for decades - now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
The epochal break is at the same time a problem of Christian democracy, as it is for Angela Merkel.
Surprisingly, the CSU disaster did not come, but on Sunday something came to an end, which, however, was already quite exactly ten years ago: the undoubted hegemony of a state party.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent, falling below the 50 percent mark for the first time since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, i.e. in the much-quoted Stoiber era.
The modernization that the CSU has consistently carried out in the Bundesland has finally destroyed their own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had already predicted this 40 years ago, but at the same time greatly appreciated themselves, but without the impact, the secularization, the educational successes, the influx of East and North Germans into the prosperous regions of Bavaria could not remain faithful to the CSU voters.
Modernisation is always accompanied by an increase in options, and this has political consequences.
The right-wing camp is intact - only the voters within the camp became more critical and arbitrary.
It is noteworthy that in recent weeks, it is precisely the classical groups of citizens who have expressed the greatest distance to the CSU: the free professions, the commercial citizenship and voters with a degree such as university degree.
Support for the CSU fell below 40%.
The press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Wiener Tageszeitung reports in its "Who with whom? Party leaders restrained in coalition issues" article on the chaotic domestic political situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits the SP<0xC3><0x96> from interfering in internal affairs.
The BZ<0xC3><0x96> is open to talks in all directions, while the Greens do not yet want to establish a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now it is all about the coalition; in the debates on public-law television, the party leaders hardly looked into their cards.
SP<0xC3><0x96> chief Werner Faymann reiterated his desire to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that cooperation between both parties is very possible - in some federal states and in the social partnership this is already the case.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current <0xC3><0x96>VP chief as vice-chancellor, Faymann left open.
As he said, the voters had opted out of the bowl-molder course.
A repetition of this direction would not be in question.
Molterer, however, reacted cautiously to red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said, if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
Whether his opposition party, or going into the coalition, is currently completely open, and these issues should be discussed internally by the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
BZ<0xC3><0x96> CEO Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
"To prevent red-black, we are ready to take government responsibility," Haider said.
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today in Paris, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities, which will be hosted by the EU Presidency of France this year, has begun.
In her speech to the plenary, L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka, a Fidesz MEP from the European People's Party, drew particular attention to education segregation, which is one of the most serious violations of the rights of Roma children and is the biggest obstacle to their need to apply.
The high-level conference was opened by French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs Xavier Bertrand on behalf of the French Presidency of the Council, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, the European social partners, as well as the most important European law enforcement and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
As reported by the press office of the Fidesz MEPs, J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka pointed out that, in addition to discrimination in job search, Roma would be primarily displaced from the labour market due to their low level of education.
"The vast majority of Roma youth have no secondary education, and thanks to poor primary education, only a small part of them can achieve a university degree".
Furthermore, J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka stressed that education was a fundamental human right, which would play a key role in the assertion of other human rights.
Investing in the early education of Roma children could strengthen the economy of the EU Member States.
In the view of the Members, it is important that a broader circle - i.e. Roma and non-Roma - should become aware of this relationship.
Because the sooner a Roma student starts school, the more likely they are to become a productive member of the labour market; and through income and turnover taxes they contribute to national spending.
"As citizens of the Union, Roma must be guaranteed the right to high-quality education - poor and segregated education must be stopped," said L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka.
As the honourable Member has said, the European Union needs a common, objective and action-oriented approach in order to speed up the process of de-esegregation in the education sector, which requires proper compliance with the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
“We need to break through the vicious circle of poverty, segregation, and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic opportunity to contribute to the future of Europe as fully empowered citizens,” J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka said.
Since last year’s Congress in Berlin, the summit is being held annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for advancing the goals of equal opportunities and freedom of discrimination at European as well as national level, in the context of the “European Year of Equal Opportunities”.
CSU: Mercy for Time
At the end of October, the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided
Despite the election debacle, no heads are still rolling, at the head of the Bavarian CSU, the personnel debates were postponed.
Party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein are still in office, the only question is how long this grace will last.
The fate of the tandem after the catastrophic 17% vote loss will be decided at the Extraordinary Party Congress last October weekend.
However, the duo had already made it clear that they did not want to stick to their chairs.
In doing so, they want to appease the angry faction and the party base, which one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences in the face of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - admittedly, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at his career climax - the Christian Social Union still reached 60.7 percent, but now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, they were able to secure only 43.4 percent of the votes.
For 46 years, the CSU was a "self-governor" in Bavaria, which generates 18 percent of Germany's GDP.
The Conservatives will remain the decisive force in the southern state, which is also important for the Hungarian economy, but will have to govern in a coalition in the future.
As a first sign of the party's internal restructuring, the potential successor to Huber, Vice President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer will also be involved in the exploration team, which will conduct survey talks with the liberal FDP, or the right-wing "Free Voters", about a possible Munich coalition.
Ironically, with the list of "free voters", Gabriele Pauli enters the legislature, whose anti-stolen appearance was first exploited by the Huber-Beckstein Duo, and then mercilessly served the determined politician.
The CSU leadership is now concentrating all its forces on stabilizing Beckstein.
In this transition process, Stoiber, who has so far pulled the threads out of the background, will play an active role. The former prime minister and CSU chairman called September 28 the "worst day of his political career".
On Monday, Huber made some toxic remarks towards the CDU - in his opinion the CSU would have deserved far more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which also contributed much to national success in 2005, is not reinstated with a joint act of force, Merkel cannot become chancellor again after the federal elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who has made no fuss about her disappointment with the fiasco, believes that the CSU’s loss of land will not have a negative impact on the grand coalition in Berlin.
Relatively, however, the wounded CSU will not be easier to govern, and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
At 18.6 percent, the SPD achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
In Sunday’s elections, no opposition MPs were able to enter the Ukrainian parliament.
Russian observers believe that this is due to prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but the OECD suspects illegalities in the counting of votes.
The OECD, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the legislature of the 10-million-occupied state has been running out of parliament for decades without opposition, the opposition party, which gathered under the name "United Democratic Forces" (ODS), has already seriously hoped before yesterday's elections that Lukashenko, who would leave some of the seats in the unspoiled elections, would be able to resign in 2006, thanks to a constitutional amendment.
That is why the ODS has even distanced itself from the previously planned boycotts.
Ukraine is becoming increasingly economically dependent on imports of natural gas from Russia thanks to rising prices. In order to alleviate price increases, the EU has even taken up loans, and the country has also agreed to sell Beltransgas, the owner of the gas pipeline leading through the country, to the Russians. According to the hopes and expectations of the opposition, the EU has been anti-democratic and anti-democratic.
The OECD’s election evaluation report provided a temporary relaxation, focusing more on the positive movements rather than on the shortcomings – such as the exclusion of a third of opposition candidates from the elections.
However, the OECD’s quick report criticized the campaign as early as Monday – so opposition figures are not expected to appear in the press – and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present in the counting of votes.
Despite all this, the opposition is able to see an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been placed on a free footing, and Minsk is ready for even smaller confrontations with Moscow, by continuing to recognize the independence of the detached Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, regardless of the fact that they form a Ukrainian state with Russia.
“We have taken two steps forward and one backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun,” Milinkevich said.
In the view of the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential election, a continuation is desirable, although "the powerful have been afraid to let even one opposition member into parliament".
The opposition is not planning to protest against the results, but rather is trying to make clear to voters the need for economic reform.
"We have a lot of problems here - the opposition newspapers have to be printed in Russia, the local authorities put us in the way when selling stones, but I still see that more and more people support the change, even the elderly" - said Milinkevich, referring to the fact that not even the most supportive of the pensions is the most important one.
"Thanks to the country's debt and the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the 'social security' admonished by the silence of a cemetery begins to crumble," Milinkevich said.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers have described the elections as democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Community of Independent States, told the Ria Novosti news agency: "People believe the actions, not the words." The absence of the opposition is therefore proof of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast before work"
For the first time in the history of the Palazzo Chigi there are rotatable doors for the entrances and exits of the officials.
Starting today, the measure will take effect against those sluggish eggs that will first stamp and then drink coffee during working hours.
The new anti-pollution law was introduced today by Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration, and Mauro Masi, Secretary General of the Council of Ministers' Bureau.
">"Turnable doors are a means of increasing work efficiency through a higher attendance rate and more services," said Minister Brunetta.
"Now begins a new era of responsibility and transparency.
This is reformism," Brunetta underlines once again.
With the Palazzo Chigi, the installation ends in all the buildings of the Presidium of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says: "The choice of rotatable doors is also of great symbolic value".
There was no resistance from officials, the Secretary-General assured: "This process was supported by all, cooperation came from all sides".
All in all, there is now no breakfast during working hours anymore; stop with coffee or croissant.
Brunettas advises in this regard with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 o'clock works wonders".
During a meeting of the Higher Committee of Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione)
In Rome, the minister announced that "within three months, the absences of officials have reduced to 50%, that is, 60,000 more people per year are present at work".
He added that it was necessary to strengthen the efficiency of Italy's public administration.
"their wage dynamics - according to the minister - have been twice as large as the private sector in the last 8-10 years and far above the inflation rate".
Meanwhile, thousands of officials have come together to oppose the Brunetta decree as part of the appeal supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Service is profiled with figures about fewer absences at work," writes the Consumer Center, "the people of the 'active faul skins' are growing uninterruptedly.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable civil servants have come together to declare war on the illegal norms of the decree."
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is fighting for additional financial compensation for work-related illness; so is the planned extension of the mandatory house arrest of the sick worker, during which control visits can be made and other aspects of the Minister's innovations are challenged.
Napolitano: "Prevention of accidents at work is crucial"
Every day in Italy, 2,500 work accidents occur, three people die and 27 remain invalid for life.
For the year 2007, the data of the Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm that the number of fatal accidents at work was around 1200.
These figures prove the seriousness of a phenomenon that causes almost twice as many deaths as murders.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) in all the provinces of Italy will celebrate the 58th National Day for the Victims of Work Accidents, in order to draw the attention of social institutions and media to this dramatic situation.
"The worrying data disseminated by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention in the workplace is," the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano confirms in his message to the President of the Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to workplace prevention, to the protection of injured workers, to helping the families of the victims and to raising public awareness".
"An indignant 'Basta' has risen to this; understandable in the case of tragedies that, measured by their magnitude, trigger some turmoil in the media and public participation. But everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even repeat themselves in their own dynamics".
Napolitano does not hide the fact that "there is definitely a resource problem: there must be a decisive investment in education and information."
Of particular importance are the numerous initiatives aimed at increasing direct awareness within the school system by young people who are nurturing the world of work.
It is our duty to draw attention to this phenomenon and not to distract from its social seriousness; a legislative norm must be put into effect and improved.
For his part, Chamber President Gianfranco Fini stressed "how the phenomenon of work-related deaths constitutes an urgent social emergency, which offends the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work towards decisive rules aimed at ending the problem".
"The data of the work accidents seem to signal a slight improvement, but this does not exclude that the number of work-related deaths is much too high," emphasizes the president of the Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this 'positive trend' to mean less attention; that's what causes the tragedy in the end."
"How do you think that you are doing too little to deal with the phenomenon of accidents? You can fight against it through various actions.
In our opinion, stronger controls and inspections are necessary – according to Mercandelli; but also stronger measures to educate workers who already start in school.
"An additional effort is necessary - he adds - in terms of communication and public awareness.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that represents a social emergency is in demand".
Mercandelli also spoke of "the progressive deterioration of protection for the victims of occupational accidents" and denounced the "abolition of the social system against which we have been fighting in recent years".
"The aim is, therefore, to give the worker a guarantee of insurance so that the fate of the victim of a work accident does not depend on voluntary or random donations, which are decided from time to time by a legislator."
Mp3 Player Under Charge: Risk of Hearing Damage
Listening to loud music over a longer period of time with portable music devices, such as Mp3 players, can lead to permanent hearing loss.
This is reported by the European Commission, which quotes the opinion of the Csserri (Scientific Committee on Current and Recently Identified Health Risks) of the EU in a report published today in Brussels.
“It is clear from the report that 5-10% of those who listen to loud music with portable devices for at least five years per week for more than an hour a day risk permanent hearing loss.”
“I’m worried that such a large number of young people, who usually put portable music devices and mobile phones at a high volume, will irreparably damage their hearing without knowing it,” Kuneva said.
"From the scientific findings - it is said on the part of the EU - there is a clear risk that urges rapid action.
What really matters is to sensitize consumers and make this information a common good.
In the light of these scientific findings, we need to re-examine the existing control systems so that they are fully effective and keep up with the new technology."
Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable musical devices among young people.
"The scientists confirm that they are rightly concerned and that the European Commission, together with the other EU members and those affected, will now be examining the necessary measures to better protect children and young people from the noise coming from portable music devices and similar devices."
At the moment, there is already a European standard limiting the noise level of portable music devices to 100 dB. The concern about the damage that could come from excessive noise pollution.
These damages can be very limited by resorting to solutions such as reducing the volume and length of the noise exposure.
In its report, the EU Scientific Committee points out that when users of portable music devices only listen to music for five hours a week (more than 89 decibels) so that the legal limits applicable to the maximum noise level at the workplace are already exceeded.
Those who exceed this limit risk a complete loss of hearing within five years.
This affects 5-10% of users of such devices, the number of which can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Roma, Alemanno gives the launch to the "Commission for the future of the capital"
We start today, in March it is supposed to be over, in June the balance is drawn.
This is the procedure laid down by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome", which met this morning at its new headquarters behind the Caracalla Spas.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will draw up the guidelines for Rome.
Once the project is completed, the city and municipal council will evaluate the analyses and projects in order to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome in June with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and Mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," - emphasizes Alemanno. "It will submit proposals for a development plan for Rome, which will remain politically responsible for the city and municipal councils.
There is no redistribution of responsibilities, only the will to have a place where one can develop a great project for Rome.
Its task will be completed in March and the Commission will be disbanded again, as such a project must have a timely end point.
In June, the mayor announced, we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the work done by the Commission".
Those who question the competence of the Commission, because their opinion is not binding, answer Alemanno: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If it, like the Attali Commission in France, delivers high-quality results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome – then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often, politics deals with the everyday problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to have a longer period in view, in order to work seriously on the development of Rome and the future of the city in a deeper perspective".
The Mayor of Rome attaches great importance to clarifying the following: "This Commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens a penny and it will make us think, it will occupy the best minds of the capital".
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static in order to enable our city to make a quality leap - which it really needs - and thus to take a common step into the future".
A future, according to the Mayor of Rome, which "will not only limit itself to the current municipal boundaries, but will look much further", not only with regard to the role of Rome as the metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean.
Obama – the first anti-American president? Here a statement
A well-known American politician, who has a lot to do with being considered independent, has written: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, through his decisions, decimated the economy of the United States and maintained relations with the enemy Islam (and still does this today as a private man).
The attacks on Obama are getting more and more violent, right now as the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote on an internet site: "This person is full of ambition.
Obama is very rude: he thinks he will get the highest office of a nation that has seen a total of two black governors and five black senators!"
However, these attacks don’t really have much to say; they are racist attacks and they don’t answer the voters’ question: will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; everyone says that Obama will win with a big lead.
Also in this case, there are people who speak with the heart and not with the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, wrote in its editorial: only in the polling booth will we know who the real American patriot will give his voice to.
Here comes a U.S. mentality that has been kept hidden until recently.
"Say what you want, and we'll decide who we're going to do our shit for, whether it's Obama or McCain."
There are people here who swear that if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something you’ve never heard before – only now, when the success of the black candidate seems so certain.
In any case, despite all these considerations, the ultimate weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1,500 people were asked: What mistakes did Bush make during his tenure? 89% answered: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with a kick in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains Bush’s weak spot for the majority.
The one who will take his place is faced with a huge task.
The financial collapse also leaves its traces with journalists: in the newspapers you can already feel the cuts. And many accuse the Internet, the "murderer" of the press.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control regarding the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
Nevertheless, they did not express any real concern about the general credibility of the information concerning the competent authorities.
They don’t feel as alone as they used to.
The problem for American journalists is money.
For these journalists, the 2008 crisis is a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed.
In addition, the big problems come from the cuts to the Newsroom, that is, the space in which the editors work to compile the newspaper.
This is a problem that needs to be solved – according to the interviewed journalists – if you want to prevent traditional journalism, as the general public understands it, from shrinking significantly.
A clear but complicated pessimism now satisfies the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and senior executives of the press believe that journalism at the national level is on the wrong track.
In the local area, the executives are even at the 65%.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine the direction in which the web is going.
The main publishing groups are making their way to the Internet, which is considered by many to be the "killer" of the printing press.
The “economic pressure” that journalists feel has risen by up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted to wanting to join the new technology, hoping "it will bring something good for journalism."
The biggest rift in American journalism today is between the editors-in-chief of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them.
56% of editors-in-chief at the national level are confident that their reporters share their values with them, while only 23% are at the local level.
Some think it has to do with “safety at work.”
Managers who are afraid of losing their jobs within three years are 47% nationally.
Journalists account for 30%.
The topic of "safe work" in the team (our "editors", note d. Red.) is always a topical topic in the United States.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV stations and internet operators, employers offer as they like and so it becomes a matter of take it or leave it.
The editor-in-chief often gets very high salaries, while the editor can sometimes only get 10000 euros per month, in addition to pension and insurance funds.
As for the holiday, the thing becomes complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, finally after a certain number of years to reach 15 holiday days.
But American journalists, as they themselves admit, often become “sick” over the course of the year.
It is a question of climate.
UNIPOL: JUSTICE IN ROME: DANILO COPPOLA STAYED IN GROTTAFERRATA
The President of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the application of the real estate agent, who had asked to be moved by Grottaferrata to Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in the context of the investigation into the counter-agreement in the event of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
In the course of the trial against him during the last week, his release from house arrest was converted into a residency obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate agent to be moved from the provincial city to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such depositions (against which the public prosecutor had pronounced) could give him the opportunity to influence his society and to obtain evidence accusing him.
The elite are in danger.
The phenomenon had already revealed itself a few days ago when the House of Representatives voted against the $700 billion White House austerity package: A large part of Americans were and are more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday’s New York Times issue, which reports how the crisis in the run-up is splitting the Republican Party, which is increasingly splitting into its old and moderate East Coast soul, which has always favored state institutions and the business community, and those neoconservatives who “become hostile to Washington” and the financial world in the south.
This part of the party owes its rise to the voice of the one I mentioned above.
This example just mentioned, however, is only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake announces or even already represents: not only in the United States, but also in the entire West and perhaps beyond.
Both in the states and in Europe, the crisis seems to be accelerating the long-feared events, which, under these new conditions, finally take shape and come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the rediscovery, the unprecedented renaissance of the state in conjunction with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a decline in banking and financial institutions, which have close ties to abroad and at the same time manage an immense amount of the wealth of private households living in a single state.
This represents an immediate political problem for governments: namely, how to treat the affected families, who are also a huge mass of voters.
So the crisis appears to be economically global, but politically it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism thus seems to have strayed from itself and lost its right to speak: the clear evidence for this has been given by the EU, which, due to its division into different national and international conflicts, does not know how to find a common way.
Therefore, everyone now expects the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and, above all, distribution of relief funds: since the crisis became more and more serious, only the United States is in the economic situation to save itself without foreign aid.
And in addition to the means, they also have the legitimacy to use them: thus two conditions that cannot be overestimated – under certain circumstances – to which no other international organization and no market will be able to resort in a similar way.
That new emphasis on the national-state element is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the increasing importance that has recently been associated in the economy with a closely related sector: territoriality.
Paradoxically, it is precisely now that we were so convinced that we had long since entered a networked whole realm, into a realm of ever-differentiated technologies, of the immaterial, that we have to find out at once how our future will depend more and more on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
While they can all be transported from one place to another in the world, they are still connected to a narrowly defined piece of earth – a territory.
Therefore, one who has such a territory is in favour of another, who lives in an area that is unproductive, waterless or free of oil deposits.
I now come to the second novelty, which, however, requires a brief insertion.
Who says territory, who says government, who says politics, says leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to be creating two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for respected leadership, that is, the need for someone who knows how to manage things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of anger over the existing leaderships, including those of the economy, which have emerged as inadequate and full of shadow zones.
Finally, there is a deeper and, in a sense, more troubling aspect: a loss of confidence, an impatience, a picture of inadequacy, a sense of remoteness, all directed at a whole class of managers in Western countries.
It seems to pave the way for the conviction among large parts of the population that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but already their world of ideas, their way of life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose content appears to the majority to be increasingly foreign and overwhelming.
The demand for leadership may thus be fueling an underground, branched but powerful movement towards the de-empowerment of the leading class and the traditional political establishment, which is manifested in unforeseen "revolts" of the electorate and in the immediate revival of the collective state of mind over the bourgeoisie in recent times, beginning with the uprising of the Bavarians.
One gets the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say their format, more and more problems of understanding and therefore less representative value with regard to what is happening today in the lower social layers of the West and is still being driven from the financial crisis.
In the face of all this, it would simply be exaggerated to speak of a “rebellion of the masses”.
Keeping your eyes wide open is certainly not.
The super glue that makes walls go up
Defeat the forces of gravity thanks to an adhesive and be able to climb walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centers, one of which now appears to have almost reached its target.
With an adhesive applied to an area of only 2.5 qcm, the researchers succeeded in fixing a 100 kg-weight body to a vertical wall.
The STUDIO – an American journal has published the results of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already used, which use a special carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of adhesive can be imagined as a series of a stack of spaghetti arranged tubes," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of the geckos, which are covered with microscopic hairs that give the animal a perfect hold.
Tests carried out with various materials such as glass teflon and sandpaper have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the strength of the reptiles' feet and at the same time "easily removes it from the wall," said Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's Faculty of Engineering.
"This material could be used as a transient adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Maybe, but researchers are thinking of a less fascinating benefit, such as connecting electrical devices, because the nanotubes are also conductors of heat and electricity, so it is possible that the nanotubes are also conductors of heat and electricity.
Other areas of application could fall into the space field.
For now, the superheroes have to wait.
THE OTHER TYPE OF RESEARCH – also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new type of adhesive.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, California scientists present an adhesive made of microfibers that, like hair, clean themselves from dust by movement on a surface, thus always retaining a perfect adhesion.
Medicinal product: never take with fruit juice
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed due to their refreshing quality and vitamin richness, including in the summer, can cause serious harm to health if they are taken at the same time with certain vital drugs, as they can have an extreme effect on the absorption of these by the body.
David Bailey, professor of health at the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points out the risk of packaged as well as fresh fruit juices in connection with drug use. At the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he again sounded the alarm: It is enough to virtually eliminate these a glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected to be responsible for increasing the effects of some drugs such as antibiotics, anti-asthma drugs, cardiovascular drugs, anxiolytic and neurological agents, up to toxic levels.
The same drug agency had warned doctors and patients about the dangers of this mix in a report two years ago, and emphasized paying attention to what is being drunk in conjunction with drugs such as diazepam or methadone.
It’s not just grapefruit – according to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit the drugs.
The list of active ingredients inhibited by the fruit juices is long.
Michele Carruba, director of the Universit<0xC3><0xA0> Statale di Milano, said: "Such results are usually immediately forwarded to the various international manufacturers, who are thus free to change consumer information.
Therefore, it is advisable to always read the package leaflet and, if there are still ambiguities, not to be afraid to ask a pharmacist or doctor," emphasizes the expert of the Ansa agency.
Nobel Prize for Economics goes to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics is awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the settlement of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the Bush administration’s biggest critics of economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the September 11, 2001 attacks, during the days of the Enron Collapse, Krugman had claimed in a New York Times editorial that this second event was more crucial to U.S. history than the assassinations.
A prediction that received a lot of controversy in response and was presented to the economist years later, but today proves to be completely correct.
"I'm surprised and also shocked at how quickly the memory of the scandals in the context of the collapses of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from the public eye," Krugman explained at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an "economist of great value" but also a basalt analyst with a "very aggressive style, particularly against the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration."
Open Office, there is the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package
The day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; the open source software is gaining an increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, both among freelancers and in the public administration, as a free replacement for Microsoft's Office.
After a year of intensive work by the volunteer developers, which is supervised by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office now presents itself to the public with some new features: in addition to a revised and now more spartanly designed start menu, now finally one of the most basic compatibility with Apple's operating system Mac OS x form is achieved, as well as the support DF for the new version of the document.
Attention was also paid to the compatibility with Microsoft's Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Also interesting are some new features, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which makes it easier to send via email, including the ability to import PDF files into graphic editing modules while preserving the original appearance of the page.
Thus, you can now also generate "hybrid" PDF files, which extend the typical graphics of the Adobe format by the elements of a table and a word processing system.
Collaboration is one of the most improved elements of the applications: tables can now be edited multiple times by different users, thus avoiding conflicts in case of changes; in the case of the word processing system, each editor is assigned a frase to guarantee a better correction procedure.
Some companies are just about to publish various OpenOffice features on the Internet (on the cloud), while the final result is set to be made public in the coming weeks.
The Italian version is available for download at the following link: http://en.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, thus following the English version, which has been on the mirrors since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can be sent to your home or office.
However, while free-of-charge can be an incentive for the distribution of the program to private households, it is also precisely in the area of business where OpenOffice could succeed: after all, various public administration institutions and schools have already switched to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is not even a lack of a training offer, which means optimal help for small and medium-sized businesses, and thus even opens up business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the Word-like text creation program; Calc, the spreadsheet program that aims at extrusion of Excel; Impress, to create presentations as with Powerpoint; Dbase to run databases instead of the more familiar Access; and finally, Draw, a graphical module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads – a goal that can easily be exceeded with 3 million and 600,000 already reached.
Also tested positive for cabbage and thus the fourth doping case
A new doping case opens within the framework of the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the Gerolsteiner team, who is the third-classified and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
The news was published by the daily L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old Kohl from the Gerolsteiner team is the fourth driver to have been tested positive on Cera, the third-generation Epo, previously with the Italians Riccardo Ricc<0xC3><0xB2> and Leonardo Piepoli as well as the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analyses from the coal blood samples are among those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-tests now confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place and be excluded from the race for two years.
The head of the French anti-doping commission, Pierre Bordry, confirmed the positive epotest, and also informed the Austrian officials, according to the Associated Press.
The 26-year-old Austrian climbed the podium behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans and also claimed the jersey of the best climber for himself.
THEME OF IMMIGRATION: THE NEW YORK TIMES QUESTIONS: IS ITALY RASSISTIC?
Italy, "the former country of emigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which are admitted only with reluctance.
Does the Belpaese make this a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times asks in a long article devoted entirely to the subject of racism in Italy, based on the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, a native of Burkina Faso, who was murdered in Milan a month ago after he snatched a pack of cookies.
The case testifies to what the Times calls the “Northern Paradox”: the northern regions are those where “the most integration and job opportunities” exist, yet “the highest degree of anti-immigration sentiment and the greatest support of the Lega Nord can be seen.”
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times refers to further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation introduced by the Lega against immigration and for the faster expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement that the pope and the president also emphasize: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the pope at a meeting at the Quirinal for cooperation between church and state in the fight against racism."
Student victims of up to 900 euros per room high rental prices
The student housing market is not in crisis.
According to the latest study by the Sunia, the tenant union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken on very serious trains. So many students lose their right to study, because their families are not able to support them at this level" – says the head of the Sunia, Laura Mariani – "in these cities the great demand on the part of the students has led to a deformation of the market, which also has caused a
In addition, most rental offers involve a number of violations: free contracts, missing registrations, no rental price limit, unauthorized sub-rentals.
For the Sunia, there is a need for extraordinary measures, which result in lower rental prices due to a revision of taxation.
When looking at the investigation, it turns out that in Milan a sleeping place in the Brianza district is needed about 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the Bande Nere district) and ends with 800 euros in the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera districts or even 900 euros in the Vittoria district.
In Florence, a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the neighborhoods around the university, 250/280 euros for a bed of needs, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, the prices in the neighborhoods around the university are about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a sleeping place in a double room.
Only a little lower are the rents in the neighborhoods around the other universities of Rome: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecitt<0xC3><0xA0>.
Only those who dodge in outdoor areas can save money: 300 euros for a place to sleep and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar neighborhoods.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a sleeping place, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive neighborhoods, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, a sleeping place costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of renting to non-European students is more common, such as in Perugia, there is even another anomaly: a rent that is 25-30% above the average is required by foreign students.
Goodbye to the old Paradiso cinema – the cities close their historic cinema halls
The historic cinemas close due to the favored multiplex cinemas.
“A city without cinema is a blind city, like a face without eyes.”
This picture by the director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is currently happening in the large urban centers of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of exclusion of cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multi-saal complexes in the periphery, means, in the long run, the death of the one-saal cinema in the center. A process that not only seems irreversible and irrevocable, but also carries the traits of a cultural crime.
It is like losing a friend with whom you have crossed a street full of emotions," says the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", which 20 years ago brought him the Oscar and the Grand Prix of Cannes. It is the story of a suburban cinema where there is always a nostalgia, which is always lost in a nostalgic way.
The figures provided by Anec, the central trade association, speak a clear language: over the past five years, the huge amount of 316 traditional cinemas have had to close; this mark paid for most of the cinemas in the major cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected are Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This shows that the main culprits are the multiplex cinemas, because it is precisely these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas has been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years, Lombardy leads the lists, 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," says Paolo Protti, the president of the Anec, "it is useful that new structures also emerge, but first of all is the preservation of the already existing, because closes a hall in the city, not all its regular customers are ready, instead of the old one a multiplex cinema in the periphery.
And here is still the missing state for the fund of the trade association of external attention: the debt burden recorded by the state is about 10 million euros.
It is a shame from an ethical-moral standpoint that the government does not comply with the existing laws.
To maintain the sector, there would be between 16 and 18 million euros a year of needs".
Interestingly, the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which, due to fears about the old cinema halls, decided to protect them by an agreement between the municipality and the Anec; it is the first agreement of its kind in Italy aimed at protecting and supporting the traditional cinemas, and this in both the historical center and the Perph.
Among the measures envisaged are tax advantages for cinema operators as well as benefits for the public with regard to local transport: it will be possible to drive to the traffic-restricted areas of the centre and also to park at cheaper parking fees.
"It is a welcome initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will join our example and also design new concepts.
Of course, we also need better audio and video equipment in order to be able to align something against the superpower of the multiplex rooms, because after all, today’s audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema has always been an important topic for me: the closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the decisive point that led me to found the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", even though I had been playing with the idea for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years; when I pass by the Rialto or the Quirinale in the Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn to the side so as not to have to see the dust-covered posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was ready to adapt the decisions of the municipality to the interests of the Mafia group Piromalli..
The accusations of the Calabrian anti-mafia authorities against the mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for involvement in mafia shops, are serious.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the senior intermediary between the clan and the public administration, and his nephew were also caught in handcuffs: the lawyer, who bears the same name as the boss of the clan, had already been sentenced to a million euros for involvement in criminal associations of the mafia, at the time.
“Disrespecting any kind of moral and legal norm,” the lawyers write, “the two local administrations had decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli funds for consulting activities.”
“This made it possible for the mafia group – so the judges – to officially invade the town halls and co-determine the policy of the public administration.”
The president of the Calabrian regional committee Agazio Loiero does not deny that in his region "it is anything but an exception to encounter connections of local administrations and organized crime." "There are places where the concentration of the mafia is greater than in others where such connections are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the Ndrangheta: heroes who maintain a white vest."
The arrests of this morning follow the one of last July with which, according to the police, the Piromalli clan was beheaded.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but already in 1991 – and also at that time due to alleged links between organized crime and local administration – the local politicians of their municipal offices had been removed.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the UDC, was elected head of the centre-right coalition after the May 2006 general election.
He shouted scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He took note of Deputy Interior Minister Marco Minniti, whom he alleged to have invented everything for political and strategic reasons, but the judges explain in connection with this morning's arrest warrant that the Piromalli clan had even dared to request a change to the A3 project.
From an interrogation operation in connection with the investigation of the case of Dal Torrione, there has been a willingness to meet the wishes of an entrepreneur, who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli – whereby the measures of public administration became identical with the interests of this clan.
When the energy comes out of the waves, the big ones suddenly run up.
It is a non-severing source of money that covers over 70% of the planet’s surface and only now do the world’s big energy companies seem to understand this.
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources that everyone is now looking at, and also looking to occupy, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of extracting energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and studied for 70 years; it is not by chance that these studies have intensified considerably since the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil collapsed around 1980, the idea of marine energy was forgotten, but now environmental organizations and the increased oil price are pushing for new impetus in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the world’s energy needs could be met by the energy generated by the ocean waves.
This would be equivalent to doubling the energy currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, there are also the currents and tides.
Giants in attack.
The first company to now rely on marine energy is Enersis, which signed a contract in 2005 to build a power plant in the north of Portugal.
When this news was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more companies from the traditional energy industry are turning to marine energy production.
“Chevron is investigating these technologies,” said a spokesman for a company known to the US giant in the Wall Street Journal, “and weighs the possibility of working with us.”
This is about obtaining an approval from the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to start a project off the coast of Alaska.
This is a sign not to be underestimated, especially considering that oil is still being promoted by the US in Alaska and President Bush recently set in motion plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, the companies Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are also investing in the new industry; if the details are not known, observers are talking about a growing interest.
Even better technologies are available.
Experts are talking about a technology that is still in its infancy, not least because the last doubts on the part of environmentalists have not yet been clarified.
So far, projects like those in Portugal and also Scotland are of a rather small dimension and do not seem to cause any serious environmental problems.
However, in order to produce energy on a large scale, technologies with a far greater impact on the environment are needed.
There are several possibilities: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of interconnected bows.
The thrust of the shafts, which moves the buoys up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the float via pistons and cylinders.
This drives a turbine, which in turn drives a generator.
The electricity is then sent to the coast via underwater lines.
So far, there are four planned installations of this type, which are only waiting for state approval. Part of the energy obtained could also be used for military facilities.
Verdant Power is already producing energy for a department store and a parking lot using undersea turbines in New York’s East River.
The water movements during the tides drive the turbines, which feeds the generator through the resulting rotational movement.
According to Verdant, a long line of potential clients are already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute for Energy Research, the potential that lies in the tides is of particular interest at the moment.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, the tides are better predictable than wind currents, solar radiation and even waves, and therefore a more reliable source of current.
Tidal energy is precisely what states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, have already invested $7.5 million in 2008 – up to $35 million are already planned for 2009.
