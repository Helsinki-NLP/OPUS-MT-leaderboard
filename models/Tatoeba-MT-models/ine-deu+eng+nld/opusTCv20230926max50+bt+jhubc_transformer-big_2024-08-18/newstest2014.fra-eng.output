Spectacular jump in "wingsuit" over Bogota
Athlete Jhonathan Florez jumped from a helicopter over Bogota, the Colombian capital, on Thursday.
Equipped with a wingsuit (a combination of wings), it passed at 160 km/h above the famous sanctuary of Monserrate, located at an altitude of more than 3,000 meters, where many badauds had gathered to observe its feat.
A black box in your car?
While U.S. road network planners struggle to find the money needed to repair declining highway infrastructure, many see a solution in the form of a small black box that attaches above your car’s dashboard.
The devices, which record all miles traveled by a motorist and transmit the information to officials, are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and in government offices to plan to overhaul the outdated system of financing major American roads.
The generally uninteresting sector of major axis planning has suddenly provoked a lively debate and turbulent alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups to push for the government to use the small boxes to keep track of the miles you’re traveling, and possibly the road you’re on, and then use the information to draft a tax bill.
The Tea Party has landed.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern about the protection of privacy.
And while members of Congress can’t agree on whether to continue, several states haven’t waited.
They are looking at how, over the next decade, they will be able to switch to a system that allows drivers to pay based on the number of miles traveled.
Thousands of motorists have already boarded these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS monitoring system, for an experimental ride.
This is truly essential for our nation.
“It’s not like we have a choice,” said Hasan Ikhrata, general manager of the Southern California Association of Governments, which predicts the state will begin recording the miles traveled by every Californian motorist by 2025.
There will be a change in the way we pay these taxes.
Technology is here to do it.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country’s Highway Trust Fund, funded with taxes that Americans pay at the pump, is financially dry.
Americans are no longer buying as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars can travel more miles with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in 20 years.
Politicians are reluctant to raise the tax, even by 1 cent, while gasoline prices are high.
“The gas tax is simply not sustainable,” said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy specialist at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently installed trackers on 500 cars to test a mile payment system.
“It turns out to be the most logical alternative in the long run,” he said.
Wonks calls this mileage usage fee.
It is not surprising that the idea appeals to urban liberals, since taxes could be used to change driving habits in ways that reduce congestion and gas emissions, for example.
California planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the goals set out in the state’s ambitious global warming laws.
But Rep. Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said he also considered it the most viable long-term alternative.
Reason Foundation free market supporters also appreciate the idea of getting drivers to pay miles.
“This isn’t just a tax slumping into a big black hole,” said Adrian Moore, vice president of politics at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits they get.
The movement is also backed by two former U.S. Secretaries of Transportation who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to go the mile payment route.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that reportedly covered about 10,000 cars.
But the House presidency killed the proposal, addressing the concerns of rural legislators representing voters who have to travel many miles every day to get to their jobs or to the city.
Nevertheless, several states and major cities are making progress on their side.
The most determined is Oregon, which has mobilized 5,000 drivers to conduct the country’s most important experiment.
These motorists will soon pay the state mileage fees instead of fuel taxes.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is considering one.
Illinois is trying a test on a limited number of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in states along the east coast of the United States (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is studying how it could implement the change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer motorists recently equipped their car with a device, drivers were concerned that the government could track their slightest facts and gestures.
“The concerns about Big Brother and that kind of thing are a big deal,” said Alauddin Khan, who heads strategic performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It's not something people want.
At the start of the trial, the Nevada ACLU warned on its website: “It would be relatively easy to turn these devices into full-fledged location devices.”
There is no need to build a huge and cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of people’s daily walks and arrivals.
Nevada is one of the few states that are now struggling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many miles a car travels, but without knowing the exact location or time.
If we can do that, Khan added, citizens will be more comfortable.
Research into this technology has led some state agencies to call on a small California start-up called True Mileage.
Originally, the company was not intended to help motorists who pay taxes to states.
It sought to drill into the emerging auto insurance market, in which drivers would pay based on their mileage.
But the devices she tested liked big-axis planners because they don’t use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, uploaded periodically by modem.
“People will be more likely to do this if you don’t record their speed and track them,” said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
Major mistakes have been made in the pilot programmes of some States.
There are much less expensive means and much less intrusive methods of proceeding.
In Oregon, planners try the experience by offering motorists different choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They can still choose not to have a device at all, preferring to pay a plan based on the average number of miles traveled by all residents of the state.
Other states hope to sell the concept to suspicious citizens by allowing the devices to do more, rather than not enough.
In New York City, transport officials are looking to develop a charging device that would also be equipped to pay parking fees, provide “driving payment” insurance, and create a real-time speed data set from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
“Motorists would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits the system offers them,” said a paper on urban planning.
However, some transport planners wonder if the whole debate about mile payment isn't just a huge distraction.
At the San Francisco Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Commission, officials say Congress could very simply manage the Highway Trust Fund bankruptcy by raising taxes on gasoline.
An additional one-off or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid vehicles and on others whose vehicles do not consume much gasoline, so that everyone pays their fair share.
“There’s no need to resort to radical surgery when you just need aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, the commission’s director of legislation and public affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists will worry about protecting their privacy and a lot of other things.
David Bowie: Four unreleased songs
The English musician did not finish surprising this year.
Starting with The Next Day, released in January, he has concocted a luxury reissue scheduled for November 4, with several new releases.
Four have already emerged on the Web.
The announcement of the release of a new album by David Bowie had left everyone in awe.
On his 66th birthday, on January 8, 2013, he announced that a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last album, Reality, 2003) and too few public appearances, the English musician proved that he could still be relied on to sparkle the pop scene.
A feast for his fans
No surprise, David Bowie had more than one lap in his bag with The Next Day.
Thin White Duke plans to re-release the album on November 4.
For the occasion, he has concocted a real feast for his fans.
This reissue, titled The Next Day Extra, will take the form of three discs: the original album, unreleased studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four clips already unveiled.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional tracks compared to the original album: the three tracks of the Deluxe edition, five songs specially unveiled for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie made the presentations of this beautiful box in a video.
It introduces both each of the discs, but also the accessories provided with: exclusive photos and covers, a notebook to share his own impressions, a booklet with the lyrics...
And, most importantly, he gives a taste of his new title Atomica, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with guitars far ahead and skillfully mastered rock electricity.
Unpublished already listening
But Atomica is not the only title to reveal its charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the web.
The Informer is double-sided: a disturbing intro before a light ride that slows down gradually to make way for a pop ballad.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a small reference to Elton John’s Rocket Man, or even Gravity?
With this playful title, the singer seems at least in his element when he no longer has his feet on the ground.
Space Oddity, next door, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie makes another reference to his strangeness: would he come from another planet?
The guitar riffs, enchanting, make you want to leave Earth.
In any case, Bowie enjoys playing chameleon with these titles: turn informant, man on board a rocket, potential Martian...
He hides and reveals at the same time, plays to adopt different personalities, as he did throughout his career, notably with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
No wonder he has a mask in his hand in the photography of the campaign L'Invitation au Voyage, by the brand Louis Vuitton, whose new face he embodies.
It will appear in one of their advertising spots, broadcast from November 10.
The Minister of Defence, Rob Nicholson, insisted that the wounded soldiers were not summarily released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transition process was being followed by all the soldiers before they returned to civilian life.
Attacked by Liberals and New Democrats in the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson assured that before their release, members of the army followed a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All wounded soldiers are receiving appropriate care for their return to civilian life and none of them are released until they are ready, he said.
Detractors accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing injured military personnel - who do not meet the army's "universal service" rule requiring staff to be able to perform a variety of tasks - to reach the 10-year eligibility period required for re-entry.
They cited two cases reported by The Canadian Press, including that of a soldier released last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a reservist in London, Ontario, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, has been released from the army despite his request to stay for another year to receive a fully indexed pension.
His case came after Corporal Glen Kirkland, who told a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed to the exit before being ready because he did not meet the service’s universality rule.
Mr. Hawkins pointed out that a soldier could be prepared to leave, with plans and consultation sessions, but that this was totally different from wanting to leave the ranks.
“I told them I wasn’t ready,” he said in an interview with The Canadian Press on Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was a way for me to stay, and they said no.
Since the start of major fighting in Afghanistan, the military has struggled to determine what latitude it can grant to wounded soldiers who want to stay in the ranks but are not fit for combat.
Under current rules, severely wounded soldiers have up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for deployments abroad, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data presented to Parliament last year indicate that of the 1,218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the required length of service to receive retirement benefits.
Liberal former fighter spokesman Jim Karygiannis on Wednesday called for Corporal Hawkins to be reinstated, while New Democrat Jack Harris called for an immediate end to "this shameful practice."
Disney Puts on Tablets to Launch an Animated Series
U.S. media and entertainment group Disney has decided to prioritize tablets to its own TV channels for the upcoming release of a new children's series.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available from November 24 on the watchdisneyjunior.com website or via its app for phones and tablets.
Its global launch on the Disney group's channels is only expected in 2014, according to the statement of its division Disney Junior.
The cartoon, intended for children from 2 to 7 years old, tells the adventures of the pussy Callie, sheriff of a western American city where she rules the order with a magical lasso.
Each episode includes two 11-minute stories.
"Interacting with smartphones and tablets is a second nature for children today," said Albert Cheng, vice president of digital products at Disney/ABC Television Group.
This type of experience is part of Disney’s efforts to “extend the life of its series and build new relationships with its audience through increasingly important digital platforms.”
A survey published earlier this week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of children under 2 years of age have already used a tablet or a phone, and 72% of children under 8 years of age, compared to 10% and 38% respectively two years ago.
Snowden is ready to “cooperate” with Germany on the issue of US surveillance
U.S. intelligence whistleblower Edward Snowden said he was willing to go to Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met on Thursday with Mr Snowden in Russia, where he enjoys the right of asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter he presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, Mr. Snowden said: “Although the result of my efforts has obviously been positive, my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a leak and seeks to penalize political discourse with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself.”
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he believed that international community support could persuade the U.S. government to drop the criminal charges against him.
As part of the complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, he is charged with espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will make that possible.”
Relations between the United States and Germany have been put to the test following complaints that the NSA had tapped the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the deputy who heads the parliamentary group overseeing foreign secret services, said that if there was a chance to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness "without putting him in danger and completely ruining relations with the United States," it was necessary to take advantage of it.
Mr. Ströbele, a German Green MP, posted a photo of himself with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele said that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA consultant, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr. Snowden testified in Germany, he would have to be given the assurance that he would be “safe” there, the MP said.
Mr Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been the subject of a “serious and sustained” persecution campaign that had forced him to leave his country.
However, he said he had been encouraged by the global response to “my act of political expression.”
Citizens around the world as well as senior officials – including in the United States – considered the revelation of an inexplicable permanent surveillance system to be of public utility.
The letter put forward an offer of cooperation with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved”.
Cogeco Cable Could Soon Offer Interactive TV
Cogeco Cable subscribers may well have access to apps like Facebook, Twitter and ultimately the on-demand video service Netflix via their TV in a not-so-distant future.
Cogeco’s subsidiary said on Thursday that it is currently conducting preliminary tests of the beta version of the platform with some of its users.
“This will allow us to showcase more user-friendly interfaces as well as more options,” Cogeco President and CEO Louis Audet said in an interview.
Cogeco Cable is thus catching up with its competitors, like Bell, even though the Cogeco subsidiary does not yet have a precise date for this new platform.
“We have to adapt and change or resist change and fail,” Audet said.
The ultimate goal remains to provide tools that our customers do not currently have access to.
Telecommunications giant Rogers has already indicated that it could offer Netflix if certain technical details, which have not been cited, could be settled.
In the United States, the popular video service is said to be in discussions with some major cable distributors so that its service is available through their streaming platforms.
Cogeco and Cogeco Cable also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government during its Speech from the Throne on October 16.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite TV providers to offer customers the ability to pay for services on a pay-as-you-go basis.
“It’s been about two and a half years since we’ve been saying that the idea of forcing consumers to buy major chain packages doesn’t work,” Audet said.
However, he hoped that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) would lead to interesting recommendations.
"There will have to emerge from these discussions a kind of new framework to define our new Canadian cultural policy with regard to television," Cogeco said.
The CRTC has been conducting public consultations since last week and is expected to continue with the industry next spring.
On the earnings side, Cogeco reported a net profit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or <0xC2><0xA2>82 per share.
This is a decrease compared to net profit of 44.9 million, or 83<0xC2><0xA2> per share, from the same period last year.
The Montreal-based company explains this decline through depreciation costs related to new acquisitions.
In 2012, Cogeco acquired the U.S.-based cable company Atlantic Broadband for $1.36 billion.
It was the first major acquisition of the company after the one that had failed in Portugal.
Last December, the Montreal-based company also purchased Peer 1 Network Entreprises, an Internet provider based in Vancouver, for the sum of $526 million.
As for Cogeco’s revenues, they grew by 41.5% in the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million.
They are 1.8 billion for the current financial year.
The net profit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was 43.9 million, or 90 <0xC2><0xA2> per share, down from 45.7 million, or 93 <0xC2><0xA2> per share, in the same period last year.
Cogeco Cable’s revenues, however, increased by 45% to reach 470.4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers in the fourth quarter.
However, for the fiscal year 2013, the number of Cogeco Cable customers increased by 5546.
Mr. Audet is not concerned about the number of customers fluctuating in this way.
For me, this is not an indication of a change in trend, he observed.
It varies from one quarter to the next with very strong competition.
From horse to beef products
Horse meat has been found in cans of beef-based products, sold by two small British retailers at low prices, the agency in charge of food hygiene announced today.
Routine tests revealed that the products, developed in January in Romania and sold by the Home Bargains and Quality Save chains, contained horse DNA at the rate of 1 to 5%.
"Since horsemeat is not mentioned in the ingredients list, it should not have been present in the product," the agency said.
A scandal over the presence of horse meat in cooked dishes erupted in Europe earlier this year, following tests carried out in Ireland.
According to reviews by the European Commission, France was the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products supposed to contain only beef.
A collision between two vehicles injured four people early Friday on Route 131 in Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
Shortly before 4am, a motorist driving north in Saint-Félix-de-Valois lost control of his vehicle and hit a car coming in the other direction.
The four occupants of the two vehicles were injured, but there was no fear for their lives.
Traffic was back to normal around 6 a.m. on Friday.
Frontier Airlines plans to charge for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 to passengers carrying hand luggage on its flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for a carry-on and $2 for a coffee or soda, though in its announcement on Wednesday, it indicated that passengers could take the unopened can with them to the descent of the plane.
The new hand luggage fees apply to bags stored in the upper compartment, so small bags installed under the seat will always be free of charge.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if the fees were paid in advance and $100 if travelers only paid once at the boarding gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said $100 was planned to encourage travelers to pay the fees in advance.
“We don’t want to pay that price,” she said.
Airlines began paying for the first and second checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these charges were putting as much as they could in the hand luggage stored in the upper compartments, so there was often no room left in those compartments.
These fees are a way to ensure that passengers carry fewer things on board.
O'Malley said that these new fees will not really be used to raise money.
It’s about making it clear to Frontier’s most loyal customers that it’s becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the upper compartments.
Passengers who purchase their ticket on the airline’s website will not have to pay.
Thus, a passenger queuing at a Frontier boarding gate could carry a bag for free, while the next person in the queue might have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's site and check-in procedures are changing to ensure that passengers are aware of these charges before arriving at the door.
Frontier hand luggage charges will not be applied until the summer, although no date has been set.
Passengers often snore about baggage fees and other fees, but airlines love them.
They believe that baggage handling costs are high and that passengers who want this service should pay for it.
Many people on Wall Street see the addition of baggage fees as a sign that airlines are paying enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
However, many of them did not pay for their luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. applied the first hand luggage fees three years ago, and the low-cost airline Allegiant followed a little later.
The only other company imposing such fees is the Hungarian airline Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the extra fees.
He estimated, in a December 2011 report, that Spirit’s hand luggage costs were $50 million per year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently traveled on Spirit and wondered what he would find at the boarding gate when passengers discovered the company’s unusual hand luggage charges.
“I’ve never seen such a smooth boarding procedure in my entire professional career,” he said.
I was expecting to see grinning teeth and a fight break out at the door.
The plane was full, he added, “passengers got on board at the speed of lightning.”
Frontier also does as Spirit and charges $2 for coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.
Frontier indicated that passengers who take soda or fruit juice can take the unopened can with them, and those who take coffee can be served free of charge.
It will always distribute water for free.
US Airways briefly attempted to charge for drinks in 2008 but came back seven months later after passengers complained and while no other major airline had followed.
Frontier’s decision to charge for hand luggage fees when passengers do not directly purchase their ticket from the airline is its latest effort to encourage customers to go to its site.
Airlines pay online travel sellers as $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has prompted all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of contacting an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone further in this area.
In September, it began offering only half a mile of loyalty to customers who bought their ticket through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she cut mileage premiums by 25% on a trip.
For example, a 1,000-mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy their ticket directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal clientele in her hometown of Denver, but her business regresses and she loses money.
Revenues fell 9% and its flight capacity decreased by almost 13% in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic tried to fix Frontier's finances by selling the airline.
The NSA calls into question an “internal error” and not hackers for the breakdown of its website
The National Security Agency working in the shadows said Friday it was a bug that had caused its public site to crash for a few hours, and not hackers as some had claimed online.
“NSA.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a planned update,” the spy agency said in an email statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
Allegations that the failure was due to a distributed denial of service [DSD] attack are false.
Earlier this evening, online server trackers noted that the NSA site had been down for at least 6 hours, and some users still can’t access the site.
Earlier, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency’s sensitive internal network was “not at all” compromised.
No classified information is in danger, the spokesman said.
At least one group of online hacktivists claimed to be responsible for the NSA site failure by a DSD attack.
DSD attacks aim to flood a targeted site until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
The cyber-tactic is not very sophisticated and the attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The once ultra-secret NSA, a time dubbed the “No Such Agency,” has been in the spotlight and heavily criticized in recent months as a result of a wave of revelations about its extensive communications surveillance programs at the national and international levels – which are part of the NSA’s secret files stolen from the NSA.
This growing controversy around the agency has sparked a lot of speculation that tonight’s incident was the result of a targeted cyber-operation.
Delta City Centre now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville hotel closed its doors Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to developers who will turn it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Of these, 200 have still not found a new job.
Delta promises not to let its employees down.
Employers came to meet with employees directly on site, we met with employees individually to assess their needs.
“This support will continue for the next six months,” explains Félix Bisson, Delta Hotels Regional Director of Labour Relations.
The closure of the Delta is taking place in a highly competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that owned this building had choices to make.
Either he reinvested in the building to continue operating it, so there were investments of tens of millions while the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that have appeared in Montreal.
"Or he was selling it to someone else and that's what happened," said Paul Arsenault, chair of the Transat Tourism Chair at the UQAM School of Management Sciences.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months, such as the Crown Plaza, which will become a residence for the elderly.
In the meantime, four hotel projects totaling nearly 600 rooms will be launched in two years.
Titan CEO: “Goodyear Amiens Purchase Project Starts With Zero Employees”
After throwing the sponge with blows in January for the partial takeover of the Amiens-Nord Goodyear site promised to close, Maurice Taylor, the CEO of the American tire manufacturer Titan, declares, today, ready to save 333 jobs out of the 1,137 that the plant counts.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister of Productive Recovery, had already announced it, Monday, October 21.
After giving up the project to buy the plant in January, you come back today.
You had uttered violent attacks and insults, talking about "so-called workers", who "work three hours" a day, "crazy" unions, targeting the CGT.
We don't understand this face-to-face.
Is this to please Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except for my wife.
Mr. Montebourg is a charming young man trying to save some of the highest-paid industrial jobs.
If I hurt someone with my words, I'm sorry.
But France also has a high level of tax and unemployment.
Does the truth hurt you?
Work seven hours a day when in other countries you work eight hours handicap France.
In India, China and many other countries, we work ten to twelve hours a day.
I have no prejudices about France.
What I see is a factory that makes good agricultural tires, has good equipment, is well located and has space to expand.
Why does Titan need this factory so much?
Titan does not need to buy this factory.
But, with the right price and competent workers, it is worth a try.
What kind of agreement do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the plant’s closure announcement, Goodyear had offered employees a good starting allowance, I think 100% of employees would have accepted it.
Now, let's imagine that Titan buys the closed factory from Goodyear.
Therefore, Titan could move the machines to Poland or any other country in the European Union that still has its own currency.
I think Mr. Montebourg knows that.
However, he wants to keep the Amiens plant with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit them among Goodyear’s current 1,200 employees.
Also, Mr. Montebourg needs a commitment from Titan before trying to get the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear.
The first step is for the CGT and Goodyear to seal a departure allowance agreement for all employees.
As a result, there will be no more employees in the factory.
Mr. Montebourg said you were ready to secure these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm that?
The only number I mentioned to the minister is 333.
I know he'd like a four-year guarantee.
But, as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on severance pay.
If all employees accept them, the factory purchase project starts with zero employees.
How can we provide employment guarantees when there are no more employees on the site?
If Montebourg manages to get CGT and Goodyear to agree and Titan buys the plant, we intend to stay in Amiens-Nord for more than four years.
Bombardier’s Profit Declined as Aircraft Delivery and Orders Decline
Canadian aeronautical and rail manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent drop in its net profit on Thursday, under pressure from lower orders and aircraft deliveries during the third quarter and contract problems in its Trains division.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not provide in-flight test data for its all-new CSeries aircraft, nor did it provide information on whether the aircraft will meet its ambitious schedule for commercial commissioning by September.
After the inaugural flight of the test aircraft about a month and a half ago, the test aircraft only flew three times, and the question then arose as to whether the test phase was on track.
The results did not live up to the forecasts and the stock price fell by 8% on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered his rating on Thursday, moving from “overperformance” to “sector performance” due to the low potential for stock market growth in the next quarter or two coming quarters.
“Although the decline in aircraft deliveries was largely anticipated, we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the Transport division,” Cameron Doerksen said in a note to customers.
We believe that Bombardier will register new orders for its CSeries aircraft as the in-flight testing program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family of aircraft will be able to catapult it into the lower segment of a market today dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
But the number of firm orders for CSeries aircraft has so far been modest at 177. It seems that potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight tests to validate the company's claims about the energy efficiency and savings potential of the new airliner.
At present, the company has registered a total of 403 purchase orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, President and CEO, is convinced that Bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 firm orders before the commercial commissioning of the first aircraft.
The leaders also reassured analysts and the media Thursday by telling them that the program was moving ahead according to the schedule.
"The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected," Beaudoin said at a conference call, adding that ground testing and software updates were planned during the aircraft's downtime.
Each manufacturer plans in a different way.
We had decided to make a first flight and set up an update period, and that's what we did.
This will happen throughout the flight program.
The second of the five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks, the others will follow shortly after, the company said.
However, analysts are skeptical that the first customer could fly a CSeries aircraft only 12 months after its maiden flight.
Bombardier said it was evaluating the schedule for commissioning and will provide new information in the coming months.
“This slowdown in flight testing – although apparently in line with Bombardier’s internal schedule – reinforces our view that entry into service will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier’s net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
The adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenues fell slightly from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected earnings of 10 cents per share and revenues of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said it delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter, up from 57 a year earlier.
Net orders fell to 26 aircraft, up from 83 previously.
The delay in the Aerospace division was $32.9 billion as of September 30, unchanged from December 31 of the previous year.
“In Aeronautics, the results were in line with our forecasts, but the low number of orders and general market conditions were disappointing,” Beaudoin said.
Aeronautics revenues fell by 13% to reach $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest railway manufacturer, said the division’s revenues had risen nearly 11% to $2.1 billion.
Transport's order book totaled $32.6 billion on September 30, a slight increase from December 31 of the previous year.
The margins of the Transport division have been affected by implementation problems for some large contracts.
The leaders announced that new indications would be provided during the fourth quarter.
Bombardier’s stock price, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, chief financial officer of Google Inc, would sit on the board, fell by 8.5% to $4.83 CAD on Thursday afternoon.
Brazil’s Embraer SA, the world’s third-largest aerospace manufacturer and closest competitor to Bombardier, reported a 10 percent drop in its quarterly profit on Thursday.
Two 23- and 27-year-old speleologists have been missing in a hole under the Dent de Crolles since Thursday night, the Is<0xC3><0xA8>re Rescue Game learned on Friday.
They were located this Friday afternoon.
The two men, one skilled in the practice and the other not, had left underground on Thursday around 21:30 to make a crossing of the Dent de Crolles, located in the municipality of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
We have not heard from them since then, the same source said.
"The speleologists should have come out around 5 a.m.," said Thierry Larribe, technical adviser at the Rescue Speleo in charge of the rescue organization.
Dozens of people on site
About twenty rescuers, ten civilians members of the French Relief Speleo, as well as gendarmes, CRS and firefighters were on site.
At the end of the afternoon on Friday, the two speleologists were located.
"It is another group of speleologists who, after finding them exhausted but healthy in the cavity, transmitted the information to one of the rescue teams engaged in the network," explains Le Dauphiné.
The two soldiers of the 13th Battalion of the Chambéry Alpine Hunters were found "exhausted, but not injured".
They got lost in the network, turned on their steps while waiting for the rescue, the prefecture said.
Refueled, they should emerge from the cavity with the help of rescuers in the evening.
German Journalists Invited to Escape Google and Yahoo
The German journalists' union on Thursday urged its members to stop using online services from Google and Yahoo after new revelations about the activities of U.S. and British intelligence services.
"The German Federation of Journalists recommends that journalists avoid using Google and Yahoo's search engines and messaging until further notice," she said in a statement.
According to the Washington Post, the US National Security Agency (NSA) and the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) have collected masses of information by infiltrating international networks that allow the two companies to synchronize their servers.
“The research carried out by the journalists is as confidential as the contact details of their sources and the nature of their communications with them,” said Michael Konken, president of the union that claims 38,000 members.
Fires repainted: a member requests the resignation of Brigitte Grouwels
The project of Minister Brigitte Grouwels to "relift" the poles of the traffic lights in Brussels does not please everyone.
As a reminder, the Brussels Minister of Public Works and Transport launched on Thursday in the center of Brussels a test project consisting of repainting 16 poles of signalling lights of the region in the colors yellow and blue of Brussels.
The aim is to “increase security” and “Brussels identity”.
The idea is, in the long run, to repaint all the Brussels traffic lights, at an estimated cost of about one million euros.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "too dark", according to Brussels MP Emmanuel De Bock, who speaks of "flamandization" of the capital and demands the "resignation" of Brigitte Grouwels.
"Not content to spend the money of the Brusselsers insanely in relief operations of the signalling poles in the colors of the Brussels Region, Brigitte Grouwels continues her operations to flamendize the Capital," De Bock said in a statement.
After her black-yellow-mango taxis, she finally repainted the Brussels poles in dark blue-yellow.
According to the MP, there is now "no longer any difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels".
The Brusselsers deserve better than to see their money wasted by a CD&V minister who runs the NVA program herself.
It is high time to stop the Trojan horse of Flanders.
“Brigitte Grouwels was only elected with 2,245 votes, or 0.5% of the Brussels voters!” concludes De Bock.
the Portico of Pont-de-Buis
The ecotaxe portico of Pont-de-Buis, around which a violent demonstration of opponents of this tax took place on Saturday, was dismantled on Thursday morning.
Cranes arrived shortly after 10 a.m., and traffic on the national was diverted in the wake.
The decision of the dismantling, announced by the prefecture of Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re on Wednesday, was taken by the company Ecomouv, the manager of the portico.
This is the last of the three ecotax porticos in the department of Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re, the other two having been dismantled or sabotaged.
Launch of an accessory store for Google Glass
An online store, offering multiple accessories dedicated to Google Glass, has just been made available to thousands of developers with a prototype of the signed Google Connected Glasses.
They can thus acquire a headphone, a charger or even a storage case.
This store, strictly reserved for developers who already have Google Glass, offers some accessories such as a charger and its USB cable, for $50.
For the same price, it is also possible to purchase a protective cover made of microfiber or an intra-ear headphone.
Although Google is currently working on a model of Google Glass equipped with corrective lenses, no large-scale marketing date has yet been confirmed.
Five years ago, my father disappeared from the world of the living.
At first I denied his death, I was talking about him in the present,
I was so afraid of forgetting it or rather I didn't know how I was going to continue to "frequency" it.
There is no recipe, no manual to go through the wall of the invisible and find his own.
Then there were signs.
The first time it was the very strong feeling of his presence in the passenger seat while I was driving.
Another time, a sweet awakening in the middle of the night to look at his watch that no longer leaves me, placed on the night table.
It is the image of my smiling father who accompanies me in my daily gestures.
Our mother left us after her exhausting fight against cancer.
At least that's what I thought the day I found his body empty, crisp on this hospital bed with crooked sheets.
Likewise, his funeral was a glacial farewell focused around the meager glow of the candles that would frame his coffin.
I thought she was gone.
Gradually, by small apparitions day or night, a little shy, a little erased, she quickly returned to my mind, changing as she took her place in the landscape of my thought which thought herself to be in mourning.
And then she revealed herself while revealing to me my own facets that I had not yet perceived, masked by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had in no way lost my mother’s person but simply a woman I didn’t really know, a woman who embodied that person, during his stay in life.
By dying, this woman had perfected her life and freed the person I loved, and here I found her, full and whole.
This detour from the path of my life remains the most unexpected and the most beautiful.
It is a privilege to know that loved ones never leave us.
I look like my father, "inside and out," it seems.
I've always been told that.
I never believed it at the time.
I had a difficult relationship with him until he got old, sick.
There, I was no longer afraid of him and I could love him.
One day, he died.
For a long time, he accompanied me: when I stopped smoking, when I was afraid, when I was sick...
He was talking to me, constantly encouraging me, inhabiting my body.
I could see his hands looking at mine, I could lend him my body.
But it was never indiscreet.
I could have a personal life.
He left me my privacy.
It took a long time and then one day he left.
Finally, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I don't know who said that deceased people are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are no longer there, but I always feel them close to me.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always refer to it: what would they have said? what would they have thought? what would they have done?
I constantly dream of them, maybe not every night but several times a week it is certain.
I often dream of the last moments that I have to share with them before it is too late, only there is always one thing that prevents me from accomplishing this moment.
I often wake up anxious when it happens to me and I deeply feel their absence.
Sometimes, some dreams carry me the opposite and fit into my story and indeed, they continue to live and share my life.
The day before my ultrasound where I had to know the sex of my baby, I dreamed that I would wake up, get out of bed, my father would wait for me on the landing and he would smile at me and rejoice that I was waiting for a little boy.
The next day, I had the feeling that he had visited me in my sleep to signify that he was happily sharing what was happening to me.
And of course, there was a little boy in my belly.
I enjoyed sharing this moment with him and I enjoy telling this common memory lived after his death.
Exactly five years ago, my grandmother died of cancer.
A year ago, she was on a trip with my family to Cuba.
That is to say the shock that his disappearance caused in the young bachelor I was at the time.
I realized my grief quite quickly.
But it continues to influence my life, especially in times when I find myself in difficulty, or when I have to make important decisions.
Learning Arabic and being interested in the Middle East, to the point of mastering it in a large school, have not been, with hindsight, anodinous choices.
In fact, I often heard her speak Arabic in my childhood, and talk about Morocco, where she had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values she instilled in me are still present, so I sometimes think about how she would like me to act at some point.
The same is true of my attitudes: I try to live up to the generosity and uprightness of the spirit of the one who was a fervent believer.
Now I feel it as a daily presence, a benevolent soul, a saving spirit.
I can see his eyes on me.
My mother died nineteen years ago now.
He died after talking to me on the phone.
I have gone through all the phases: misunderstanding, anger, pain, crying that triggers itself, anywhere, anytime, in unusual places, incongruous moments.
Then, time eased the pain.
All that remained was the lack, the emptiness without an answer, the need for her, to trust me, to reassure me in the depths of her sweetness.
Yet she is there, silent presence, she is there and looking at me.
Every morning, I see her anxious eyes resting on me, I see the circles that make her look heavier, the wrinkles around the lips that cigarettes dig, the folds that mark the forehead on days of anxiety.
My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I turn my eyes away.
My wife and the mother of my three children died of cancer at the age of 43.
We constantly feel his protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his bed of pain, so we gradually learned to smile again, and to pronounce his name is no longer taboo but a comfort.
Of course, I talk to her in the middle of the night when the absence hurts too much, she invites herself into my dreams when the morale is a bit reached.
We feel carried and protected in difficult times, the decline of time makes us realize how she was a conductor and we try to stay on the path she had traced us.
If a being has loved you very much, the absence cannot snatch it from your heart and memories.
In a way, being loved becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008 to asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he thought or liked.
I could not attend his burial and three weeks after his death, I gave birth to a little boy.
If I have my beliefs at times different from his, I always wonder if my actions are in line with his view of things.
I have had problems in my work for these beliefs.
For me, it is impossible to go in the opposite direction, I do not sleep and I always wonder what he will think of it.
I don’t know if I’ve adopted his way of being or if I’m just like him: is it genetic?
In any case, it will always be my reference.
It was a bit like an alter-ego, there was no need to talk between us.
In short, he is there every day.
I feel his presence and that makes me happy.
It is almost thirty years since my husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 years old and my son was 6.
The immense pain that then invaded me has, of course, subsided, but it is still close to me.
Very often he "landes" in my dreams in such a precise way, so vivid that when I wake up I am even more sad to see that it was just a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was okay, I said no, he answered me "I'm going down" but in such a real voice that I woke up in a blink of anguish and turned on the bedside lamp looking everywhere, convinced that it was going to happen.
I always live in the same house, and often I feel watched and I turn around to see if he's not there, I know it's him and I talk to him.
In every room I feel his presence and that makes me happy.
For nothing in the world would I leave this house where we were happy and where his spirit lives with me.
I am 58 years old, I have always lived alone since his departure, he is and will remain the love of my life.
I want to clarify that I am sociable with a responsible trade, I laugh and I sing, I go out, I am a grandmother, I have many friends, but my heart and my soul belong to him and I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October was the bloodiest month since 2008
October was the deadliest month in Iraq since April 2008.
Baghdad released official figures on Friday: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 policemen and 44 soldiers.
This publication takes place on the day the Iraqi Prime Minister is received by the US President.
Nouri al-Maliki wants help from the United States.
“We don’t tell the world to stand by our side and support us, we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it,” Al-Maliki said Thursday in Washington.
And also because if what is happening in Iraq is not settled, it will expand, and what is happening in Syria will expand as well.
And what happens when a virus of terrorism lives? it spreads.
Nouri al-Maliki spoke at the United States Institute for Peace, an independent institution created by Congress.
Outside the building, protesters were protesting against the Iraqi leader.
They waved signs accusing him, among other things, of being a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to provide him with help.
The cocaine lawyer who informed a drug sponsor of a police investigation has been jailed
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be revealed in the open
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Court of Assizes of Liverpool
A senior defense lawyer, who had informed a drug sponsor of a major police investigation because he feared his secret drug addiction would be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave sensitive information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough about investigations into his drug-related activities after being compromised because of his cocaine habit.
The lawyer, who was nicknamed "Bash" and considered by criminals to be a "major case", was arrested at his home in 2011 as a result of police wiretapping operations directed at Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous drug-trafficking trial.
Police officers spotted Sarborough, 32, dropping three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was attending a Bar dinner with colleagues.
Investigations revealed that Ditta was a “regular consumer” of this class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in her hair, wallet and credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he sought to unlawfully obtain information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of its associates.
The four suspects were then monitored by police as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in the counties of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
With 32 other men, they were subsequently jailed after police seized heroin and cocaine for <0xC2><0xA3>1.5m, as well as more than <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42, was providing information to criminals because he feared his addiction would be revealed to the public.
Today at Liverpool’s courthouse, Ditta, who works at the Forbes Solicitors law firm in Blackburn, fell into disgrace after being found guilty on two counts of obstruction of justice after a three-week trial.
He admitted possession of cocaine at a previous hearing.
The lawyer’s fall came after police, investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and spotted him arriving at Ditta's home and putting 60% pure drugs under the lawyer's trash can in a black golf glove.
Shortly after the deposit, Scarborough was regularly in telephone contact with Ditta who was at a dinner at the football stadium of Ewood Park, pregnant with the Blackburn Rovers club.
The lawyer went home, discovered the drug, and they called each other nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a “regular user” of cocaine after tests showed traces of this class A drug in her hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested but denied using cocaine, saying he had spoken to the alleged drug trafficker because it was his client and argued that their discussions were subject to a "legal privilege".
During her arrest, Ditta picked up her wallet and tried to remove several credit cards, but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken from her.
During an interrogation, he stated that he had an office at his home, as well as at his workplace, and that it happened that clients called him home for legal matters.
But the court heard testimonies that it was calling major players in the drug trade, some of whom it had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators were aware.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: “If anyone needs to know that the law is not to be violated, he is a criminal lawyer.”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer, and of being overly involved with private clients.
The relationship we’re talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer supplying drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will no doubt be legitimate communications because he was his lawyer.
But this has gone well beyond the ordinary limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as he could to allow it to continue its criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor his profession, but he dishonored it.
He got too close to some clients, especially Scarborough, and he let his independence be compromised.
Ditta denied any wrongdoing and said, “If I was a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately.”
But after the hearing, Lancashire Police Superintendent Lee Halstead said, “Mr. Ditta has gone from a criminal lawyer to a criminal himself since he started procuring drugs from criminal organizations.”
His addiction to cocaine compromised him forever and made him vulnerable to the backstory of senior members of organized criminal groups who tasked him with obtaining valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the strictest rules of integrity and establish a climate of trust with the public.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the varnish of his profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organized Crime Unit conducted the investigation into Mr. Ditta, who was found guilty of the three counts of cocaine possession and now obstructing justice, testifying to his commitment to prosecuting criminals.
That this case serves as a warning to criminals so that they know that no one is above the law.
We will find you and translate you before the courts.
Scarborough himself was jailed for 14 years after pleading guilty to complicity in the trafficking of heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other people involved in trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his website, Ditta organized a question-and-answer session about himself during which he said his dream job would be to be a lawyer to represent clients in the corridor of death in America, his last guest to dinner would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would be what would motivate him to work.
Aretha Franklin to return to the stage in December
The Detroit News newspaper reports that the Queen of Soul will perform on December 21 at the Sound Board room of the MotorCity Casino hotel.
In November, Franklin recorded an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.
Without specifying the illness she was suffering from, Respect’s famous interpreter told the media on October 16 that the side effects of a treatment she was receiving were “difficult”.
She said she was “happy to be back.”
Menton reduces the cost of its Christmas lighting
420 patterns, 2.2 kilometers of seaside covered with a light coat: one could watch the heat in Menton with the bill of illuminations.
An invoice that, unlike many municipalities, is additionally settled by taxpayers, not by trade associations.
To reduce its costs, the city uses LEDs.
But also a differentiated management of the network of public lighting and Christmas decorations.
Los Angeles Airport evacuated after a shooting
A shooting took place at Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10:00 a.m. local time when a man opened fire.
According to local police, at least two people were injured.
It would be an employee working for the U.S. Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) and the gunman.
The incident occurred at Terminal 3, causing a wave of panic.
Travelers and staff rushed to the exits or onto the tarmac.
Very quickly police intervened and a man suspected of being the shooter was apprehended on the roof of an airport car park.
The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is interrupted.
Classical singing for teenagers
Each time, it is the school clientele that will be targeted, an initiative that had been very successful during the previous season.
Through five saynets imagined and performed by local artists, vignettes with a high dose of humor, teenagers are allowed to master classical singing.
In addition to this show, the Société d’art lyrique du Royaume will return with its lyrical Destinations, a formula that now fills the Pulperie de Chicoutimi.
Two more concerts will take place in the summer of 2014, giving local artists the chance to show what they are capable of.
To these activities was added the lyrical Apéro, the benefit concert held last August, with the competition of the soprano coloratura Marie-<0xC3><0x88>ve Munger.
It was a beneficial activity, alongside the artistic dimension, and it helped the non-profit to produce a financial balance sheet that is as soft to the ears as a bat air.
Without providing precise figures, the chairman of the board, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of the press meeting held yesterday, in Chicoutimi, to show reassurance.
Despite the precariousness of so many cultural institutions, the future is shaping up well, even in the long run.
We have stronger and more consistent support.
"The finances are on the rise and we hope to last until the operetta's 50th anniversary, a milestone that we will reach in seven years," the administrator said.
“I would even say beyond,” added CEO Hél<0xC3><0xA8>ne Gaudreault, smiling.
The 37-year-old man who took a child hostage at Gabrielle Roy school in Surrey faces six counts, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Omar Moustapha Hassan has been accused of taking hostage, kidnapping, threatening, carrying a weapon in a dangerous design, kidnapping, and failing to comply with an order.
“The rapid reactions of the police involved and their ability to immediately defuse the situation were essential to the safe conclusion of this incident,” said Corporal Bert Paquet.
Omar Hassan is still in custody and is due to appear in court on Friday.
New request for collective redress against the Sainte-Croix brothers
A new collective appeal was filed against the Sainte-Croix brothers, concerning sexual assaults that were allegedly carried out this time at the Saint-Joseph oratory as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The application is based on the testimony of the applicant, identified as "J. J.", who was allegedly masturbated in the 1950s, first at Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher, Brother Submis, and then by his confessor, Father Bernard, at the oratory of Saint-Joseph, where he was serving as a pastor.
The first appeal concerned only three establishments, and when the settlement was announced, many people said to us: "I, I was in such a place, can I register?" says lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in both appeals.
The class action that has just been filed has the peculiarity of allowing the addition of complainants from any establishment where abuse could have been perpetrated by members of the congregation of Sainte-Croix.
At the moment, the appeal brings together the complaints of 25 people who claim to have been assaulted by the Sainte-Croix brothers.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, since several of the institutions concerned closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal also underlines that the Congregation of the Holy Cross and the Oratory of Saint Joseph, which is a separate entity, "allowed sexual abuse to be perpetrated against children", that they "exercised a moral, religious and psychological constraint on the victims" and that they "did not harm the victims" and "did not harm them".
The latter accusations are based, among other things, on letters written by the Sainte-Croix brothers' lawyer, <0xC3><0x89>mile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also on research in the archives on this subject by Brother Wilson Kennedy, a former Sainte-Croix brother who publicly denounced the abuses.
The class action must first pass the stage of admissibility in the High Court.
Once the admissibility has been accepted by the Court, the second step, namely the substantive hearings, is carried out.
In the case of the first appeal, the congregation of Sainte-Croix had agreed to settle amicably before hearings were held on the merits.
Important fire in a trade
A fire severely damaged a trade in Montreal's LaSalle district on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The rescue was called at around 1 a.m. on Friday because of a fire that had declared itself in the basement of an Indian cuisine restaurant on Dollard Avenue, near the intersection with Réjane Street.
The thirty firefighters who were dispatched to the site took almost an hour to control the blaze.
The fire "caused significant damage to the structure of the building," said the head of operations of the Montreal Fire Safety Service, Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one at the restaurant when the firefighters arrived on the scene.
There were no injuries, but nearly twenty dwellings, located on the first and second floors of this row of commercial premises, had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross has been requested, as residents of one of the apartments may need to be temporarily accommodated, the SIM said.
A lot of opposition to medical assistance to die in Palliative Care Congress
The Canadian Palliative Care Congress, which is taking place this week in Ottawa, comes a few days after the vote in favor of the principle of the bill on medical assistance to die in Quebec.
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all patients had access to effective care to alleviate their suffering, in addition to being able to stay home, very few would want to end their lives, according to a spokeswoman for the Canadian Palliative Care Association, Maryse Bouvette.
If the emphasis was placed on palliative care in Canada, the approach to euthanasia would become minimal.
The president of the Quebec Palliative Care Network also rejected the bill on medical assistance to die.
If adopted, Alberte Déry is concerned about the consequences for future generations.
"What is the meaning of life," she laments.
The majority of palliative care homes will refuse to help patients die, according to the Alliance of Palliative Care Homes Vice President Suzanne Fitzback.
Ms. Fitzback, also director of the Mathieu-Froment-Savoie house in Gatineau, believes that the service would be unnecessary anyway.
We're never asked, "I want to die, give me an injection."
The Director of the Palliative Care Association of Ontario, Rick Firth, believes that the Quebec bill is disorienting the public about the vocation of palliative care.
He doesn't think Ontario will follow suit.
For her part, Gatineau’s Liberal MP, Stéphanie Vallée, says the notion of end of life will need to be clarified before the bill is passed.
Kenyan Press Outrages Controversial Media Law
“It is a frightening country and it is legitimate to ask the following question: what will prevent Parliament from sweeping away the independence of the judicial system tomorrow?” the newspaper said, challenging the bill and calling for it to be declared unconstitutional.
“This law is draconian and very punitive, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group – owner of CapitalFM, one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media court “will always be biased because it is an extension of government” and that restrictions on content and advertising would hurt Kenya’s place in the global economy.
“I hope the president will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and send it back to parliament,” he added.
According to The Star newspaper, the new bill will allow the government to "hold control of the media." The Standard said that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya "had suffered a hard blow" and slammed the bill as "draconian".
The adoption of the bill comes at the same time as a set of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attack by armed Islamists in the Westgate shopping center last September.
Kenyan media angered authorities by broadcasting footage of CCTV cameras on which troops deployed at the scene of the attack allegedly robbed the luxury shopping mall.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded by summoning two journalists and a media official to question them, although the summons was withdrawn following a lifting of shields in the media.
Under the new bill, media will be liable to fines of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being "deleted" or no longer being able to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize an offender's property if the offender has not paid his fine.
According to the Daily Nation, “even a single fine suffices to paralyze most FM stations.”
He also said the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya’s “animated blogosphere.”
By silencing the media, politicians know that they can do whatever they want with impunity.
“No one will ever know,” Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at The Nation, wrote, describing Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life.
Delivered to themselves, the politicians would bankrupt the country and bring us back to hunting and picking.
Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of people’s anger in the past.
In May, they took a stand against cuts ordered by the National Wage Commission and restored their shillings of around 532,000 shillings per tax-exempt month – which are among the highest in the world.
A difficult year for pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists at the Centre de santé et services société (CSSS) in Laval caused quite a stir at the management of the Cité-de-la-Santé Hospital, during the year 2012-2013.
Due to multiple retirements, maternity leave or short-term departures, the pharmacy department has been found to be severely staff-deficient.
Nearly 30 percent of the workforce was missing, making this fiscal year “very difficult,” according to department head Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS decided not to hire self-employed workers, which can cost up to three times more than a full-time hired pharmacist.
There was no recourse to troubleshooting, Ms. Beaudet explained.
Some of our activities within the facility have been streamlined or scaled down to scale as things shift.
It is certain that we have worked hard to get our young people [residents in pharmacies] to come and stay here.
There is a competition of circumstances that made us in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this difficult period, the year 2013-2014 is much easier for the pharmacy department of the CSSS.
Already, three pharmacists are back to work after their maternity leave and three other pharmacists have been hired in recent months.
In addition, the efforts made by the department to retain have borne fruit, as the four students currently residing in Laval have also decided to remain employed by the CSSS.
Now it is much better, the pharmacist said.
By the end of the financial year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
This will fill our departures from last year.
Always needing crescents
However, the situation remains delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of hospital pharmacists or the predominance of young women in the profession, make situations such as the one experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [the number of staff] is always precarious, because we have a young environment and we employ a lot of young women, so with pregnancies, we almost always ride on three maternity leave when it's okay, she added.
Last year we had a lot more and we don't have pharmacies that are available to make replacements, so it was more difficult.
The 22-year-old top model doesn’t start his career in cinema by the small door.
Director Lars von Trier chose her to play Charlotte Gainsbourg in Nymphomaniac, her next film.
This pornographic drama, in eight chapters that will be released in two parts (January 1st and 8th, 2014), evokes the erotic memories of a 40-year-old addicted to sex since her teenage years.
Stacy Martin’s resemblance to her eldest is striking: a twig silhouette, a diaphanous complexion and French-English origins.
Without forgetting a certain taste of risk: the one who had not hesitated to lay naked on ice paper will appear in much more sulphurous situations on the big screen.
An extract of Nymphomaniac raised the temperature on the canvas: Stacy Martin appears in bed and in full ecstasy with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative filmmaker asked his actors to put their shyness in the closet, he resorted to X professionals for the most daring sex scenes, before merging all the bodies digitally: above the belt is the star; below, the lining.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsbourg, through Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier is used to pushing his actresses into their last cuts, always for the better.
Stacy Martin hasn't finished talking about her.
A room of the CGR of Narbonne evacuated Thursday evening
On Thursday evening, the first session of a film was interrupted at the Mega CGR in Narbonne, as a precautionary measure, as a result of sneezing felt by the spectators.
Immediately, the director of the facility ordered the evacuation of the room and alerted the firefighters to a suspicious odor.
About 70 people left the meeting.
The people were examined and a full recognition of the room gave nothing.
Bad joke against a backdrop of tear gas?
Or an involuntary incident?
It is always the case that cinema management has played the precautionary principle and the safety of its customers thoroughly.
The room was ventilated and everything came back in order.
The cinema was able to take back its rights and customers regain the pleasure of the images.
On screen only.
She tries to import 2 kg of cocaine into pumpkins
Taking advantage of Halloween day, a woman tried to bring in two kilos of cocaine hidden in pumpkins Thursday morning at Montreal-Trudeau airport.
It was during the examination of the passenger's luggage that the drug could be detected.
The cocaine had been distributed into three pumpkins that had previously been emptied.
The drug was then transported to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) office, which took over in this investigation.
The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) did not disclose where the woman came from when she was intercepted.
This is part of the investigation, said Jacqueline Roby, a spokesman for the CBSA.
What I can tell you is that she was coming to the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border guards at Montréal-Trudeau airport have carried out 173 seizures of drugs, including 10 seizures of cocaine for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, border officials in the Quebec region made a total of 1,653 seizures of narcotics.
Aerial raid on military installations in Syria
According to the Lebanese army, Israeli aircraft entered Lebanese airspace early Wednesday afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A cargo of short-range SA-8 surface-to-air missiles was reportedly targeted and destroyed.
This new IDF air raid on Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli daily Haaretz) has not been confirmed by either Israel or Syria.
The raid took place in roughly the same circumstances as the one that took place on July 5: at the time, it was also an anonymous US official who had confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, this time targeting Yakhont ground-sea missiles, delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israeli officials did not hide their irritation about Washington revealing the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to react.
Ukraine is approaching bankruptcy <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The rating agency Standard & Poor's on Friday lowered Ukraine's credit rating, questioning the ability of the former Soviet republic, which has been in recession for more than a year, to meet its financial obligations.
The rating of the country's public debt securities goes to "B-", sinking into the speculative investment category.
It comes with a negative outlook, with S&P seeing at least one in three chance that it will be lowered again within a year.
“It is less and less likely that the government’s strategy will guarantee enough foreign currency to meet its high external financing needs,” the agency said in a statement.
The agency notes that Ukraine’s foreign exchange reserves fell by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and predicts that the trend will continue.
This complicates the repayment of credits taken abroad.
These reserves, which the authorities use massively to support the local currency, the hryvnia, collapsing, the agency is increasingly likely to devalue, which would inflate its external debt.
Kiev also needs cash to settle its gas imports to Russia, which accuses it of not paying a bill of $882 million.
This announcement is bad news for the Ukrainian government in a period of intense tension with its Russian neighbor, angry at Kiev's willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was made public the day after the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had suffered its fifth consecutive quarter of contraction between July and September.
Its debt, still relatively modest, has exploded in recent years and S&P estimates it at 33.5% of GDP, down from less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, in a budget deficit, has been calling for months for help from the International Monetary Fund, which granted it a loan of $15.3 billion in 2010 and has so far unlocked only $3.4 billion.
But the Fund refuses to pay any new tranche until the country has adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, including by increasing gas prices to the population.
Following a failed new mission in the country, the IMF noted this week that “major external financing needs” were “a vulnerability” while showing “signs of economic improvement.”
However, according to economist Oleksandr Joloud of the Centre for Political Studies, "one cannot expect a short-term improvement."
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year," the expert said, according to AFP.
The only hope is an improvement in the international situation.
S&P also points out the "uncertainty" related to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels conditional on the release of opponent Yulia Tymoshenko.
"Signing the agreement would be positive for long-term trade but there could be short- and medium-term negative consequences related to Russia's reaction," said S&P, which fears "trade restrictions" on the part of Moscow.
Russia, which accounts for a quarter of Ukraine's exports, has warned that if a free trade zone is created between the EU and Kiev, it should tighten its border controls on imported goods.
U.S. green light for Publicis-Omnicom merger
Publicis and Omnicom said on Friday they received no objection from U.S. authorities to their merger, approaching the creation of the world's first advertising agency.
The merger brings together the second global agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
“Omnicom Group and Publicis Group today announced the expiration of the review period for the previously announced merger of Publicis Group and Omnicom, provided for by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended,” the two groups said in a statement.
They state that they have also received the necessary authorizations in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the examination period provided for by the HSR in the United States and the authorisation decisions issued in the other jurisdictions satisfy several of the conditions necessary for the operation to be carried out.
“The merger is also conditional on obtaining further regulatory approvals and the approval of the shareholders of both groups,” they add.
Congolese army hunts down M23 rebels
The Congolese Army (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units would pursue the M23 rebels to their bases in the forests and mountains of North Kivu bordering Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears on the verge of being defeated after being driven out of the northeastern towns of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) that it had controlled since the beginning, 20 months ago, of the insurgency.
“We’re going to pursue the M23 and bury it wherever it hides because it’s criminals,” FARDC spokesman Colonel Olivier Hamuli told Reuters.
We must not allow them to reorganize because they have been martyring the Congolese people for too long.
The time has come to bring peace.
M23 officials said they had evacuated the towns under diplomatic pressure, and Bertrand Bissimwa, the political leader of the rebellion, said on RFI that these military setbacks would not change his demands in peace talks.
According to Ugandan mediators, the latter resumed Wednesday in Kampala between the Kinshasa government and the M23.
Hangings are reported in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last town in the hands of the insurgents to fall this week, as well as around Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion was born in 2012.
At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, taking advantage of the government garrison’s escape and the passivity of the Monusco blue helmets.
The fall of Goma led the United Nations Mission in the DRC, the world's largest in terms of manpower, to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid intervention brigade composed of South African, Malawian and Tanzanian soldiers.
For its part, the FARDC General Staff was redesigned and the army went on the offensive against the M23, changing the course of the war.
The pace of progress of government troops is unprecedented today.
“The M23 seems to be coming to an end,” says Congolese business expert Jason Stearns on his Congo Siasa blog.
It would be historic - it would be the first time the Kinshasa government has managed to defeat a major insurgency.
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no allied armed group in Rwanda would be present in the eastern DRC.
United Nations experts accuse Rwanda, which denies it fiercely, of supporting militarily the M23, which was originally formed by former Congolese military mutinies.
British Foreign Secretary William Hague has invited Rwandan President Paul Kagame to exercise restraint, a Foreign Office spokesman said.
Last week, Kigali raised the possibility of military retaliation for the shells that fell on Rwandan territory.
On Wednesday, the residents of Bunagana invaded the streets of the town to greet the entrance of the FARDC soldiers.
"We lived a year with the M23 and it seemed unimaginable to us that we would one day be liberated by the army," said a resident of the border town of Uganda.
“We have lived in terror (of the M23), we are traumatized,” he added.
Tests conducted by the Pasteur Institute on a patient suspected of being infected with the coronavirus turned out to be negative, the health ministry said.
The two cases identified in May 2013 remain the only two confirmed cases in France to date.
On Tuesday, the 43-year-old patient was suspected of being hit after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already killed about 50 people.
Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, reported a decline in its quarterly profit on Friday due to falling refining margins, while its oil and gas production increased while remaining declining compared to the group's targets.
Its third-quarter net profit decreased to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per share, from $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts polled by Reuters averaged a profit per share of $2.71.
The Group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter, up from 2.52 million bpd produced a year earlier.
The company aims at 2.65 million bpj for this year, with a 25% growth of production expected by 2017.
Most of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
Due to the cost of these projects, annual investment expenditures increased by $7 billion over two years and are expected to reach $36.7 billion in 2013.
Profits from production activities decreased slightly in the third quarter, while profits from downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) fell by 45% to $380 million.
This decrease in refining margins affects the entire sector.
Chevron’s main competitor, Exxon Mobil, reported a net profit decline on Thursday, despite the increase in its gas and oil production.
School transport: the complaint is deemed admissible
The School Board of the Sherbrooke Region (SSRC) has since the beginning of the school year required a fee of $150 per student (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for students benefiting from two-residence school transportation, a service that the organization offers when it is able to do so.
Prior to the changes to the last budget, no financial contribution was claimed.
"There is a mediation service that is proposed by the commission and I was interested," explains Ms Lef<0xC3><0xA8>vre.
In her view, the SRSB was invited to mediate and requested additional time to reflect on it.
"It is always better to talk about it, to consult and to find solutions," says Ms Lef<0xC3><0xA8>vre.
The School Board of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) declined to comment.
The organization has only meant that mediation is part of the process during a complaint.
Imbroglio around the closure of the emergency room of the Hotel-Dieu
Faced with the turmoil of several months led by some of the staff and several unions, including the CGT, the Minister of Health, Marisol Touraine, had decided on July 10 to "defer the schedule of implementation of the project, and in particular the date of closure of the emergencies that will not be able to intervene on November 4".
An official request made "to take no risk on the handling of emergencies in Paris at the beginning of the winter" but which also aimed not to interfere with the PS campaign a few months from the municipalities.
Despite the ministerial guidelines, the closure should still be effective at that date.
Even if, at APHP, the term "transformation" or "change in continuity" is preferred.
As of November 4, firefighters who made about a quarter of the 40,000 annual emergency calls at the H<0xC3><0xB4>tel-Dieu will all be ordered to take thirty serious cases a day to other Parisian hospitals.
This date of November 4 also corresponds to the renewal of boarding schools.
At the H<0xC3><0xB4>tel-Dieu, interns specialized in emergencies will leave room for five interns of general medicine on Monday.
As for the transfer of internal medicine beds, it is scheduled for the course of the month.
"The emergency department of the Hotel-Dieu must close as soon as possible, and for us, it is November 4th," says Lo<0xC3><0xAF>c Capron, the president of the APHP Medical Establishment Commission (CME), who supports the management's project.
"On November 4, there will be no more patients brought by the firefighters, only people coming by their own means," confirms Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical director of the new H<0xC3><0xB4>tel-Dieu.
"But we will continue to welcome patients in emergencies," he said, arguing the permanent presence of SMUR vehicles on site to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency physicians will remain on site, he also said.
But it is up to the SRA to decide on the closure of the emergency services.
"Things are happening gradually," says Nicolas Péju, spokesman for the ARS, for whom, on November 4, "there will be no change in terms of service rendered."
"The minister has lied to us or she has been lied to," said emergency physician Gérald Kierzek.
Resigned from his position as head of the SMUR in early July for leading the fringe against the reorganization project, he defines himself as a "warner" in the face of a "cynic" decision made by "the medical-administrative technostructure".
“They are emptying and suffocating emergencies that were renovated less than five years ago,” he said.
“If the other Paris emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem.”
But they are regularly fattened.
For example, there are sometimes nine hours of waiting for emergencies in Lariboisi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
At the ARS, it is argued that thirty patients "dispatched" at several sites are not at risk of representing an "avalanche" in other emergency services, whose human resources will have otherwise been strengthened.
Both the ARS and the APHP are advocating for the "new hospital model" that has already been launched since October 7 and is expected to continue to receive 30,000 to 35,000 patients per year.
By the end of the year, liberal general practitioners are also expected to participate in the implementation of a "permanent outpatient care".
"Where do we go if we ask people to self-diagnose," asks Gérald Kierzek, for whom "the concept of no serious emergency" is "dangerous" and marks a "medical regression".
This will be the same as for Level 3 maternity.
People aren't crazy, they're going to go where there's the best care offer.
If the minister does not take action by Monday, we will change the bracket, warns Christophe Prudhomme, emergency physician and member of the CGT Health.
We will be even more present as part of the municipal campaign and we will consider presenting a list.
In the team of Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Vincent Roger, UMP adviser from Paris and elected from the 4th arrondissement, clearly announces that "even if the Parisian UMP was for the maintenance of emergencies at the H<0xC3><0xB4>tel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if we returned to the responsibilities".
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, recalled again on Monday morning on France Inter that she had voted in favour of a moratorium so that there would be no closure on November 4.
If that were the case, it would mark her clear disagreement, says Bruno Julliard, her spokesman.
Even if the restructuring of the Hotel-Dieu has its legitimacy on the merits, we cannot admit it without an acceptable pattern of deferral to other hospitals.
Obama stops wiretapping of IMF and World Bank
Barack Obama ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to end its wiretaps on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, a U.S. official said on Thursday.
This decision is part of the White House’s attempt to regain control of the NSA’s wiretapping case following revelations made by former analyst Edward Snowden, a refugee in Russia.
This is the first time IMF and World Bank surveillance has been mentioned by the intelligence agency since the scandal began.
Asked about the matter, a U.S. administration official responded: “The United States is not conducting electronic surveillance targeting the World Bank and IMF headquarters in Washington.”
Speaking under the seal of anonymity, this official did not specify whether such surveillance had been implemented in the past.
Another official said that Barack Obama had ordered the cessation of these practices in the past few weeks.
This instruction was given at about the same time as the one ending the wiretapping of the UN headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday approved a strengthening of controls on government surveillance programs but authorized their continuation.
The commission introduced new restrictions on data that intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and imposed a five-year limit on the retention of that information.
The UN welcomes the new goals for the fight against poverty
The United Nations will now work on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were put in place 12 years ago to combat global poverty.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in pushing forward “sustainable development goals” to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015, ahead of the UN Sustainable Development Summit that began in Rio de Janeiro the day before.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it was now time to “exceed national interests.”
“I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and appropriate the process to set universal sustainable development goals (SDGs),” he added.
These SDGs will build on progress made in the framework of the Millennium Development Goals and will form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals that build on the success of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing at the same time as conflicts erupt between powerful personalities
At the foot of the statue of Samora Machel, founding president of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to chant peaceful slogans during a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace to come back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of an investment company.
Worried about the future of her country, she exchanged her work clothes for a T-shirt with the words “we want security” in Portuguese before joining the crowd gathered on the Independence Square of the capital on Thursday.
For two weeks, there were almost daily reports of conflicts between government forces and Renamo, the worst hang-ups since the peace agreement that was signed more than 20 years ago.
The Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, initially supported by white-ruled Rhodesia and then the apartheid government of South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts think the country should not fall back into an open conflict, but recent events have rocked foreign investors and the local population.
The stakes are considerable for the fast-growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas and coal reserves in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion in investment over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the United States.
Frelimo, the ruling party and the main political force since 1975, and Renamo mutually reject responsibility for the tensions.
Renamo said the government was behind the recent clashes and launched an attack on its members in Sofala province, a traditional Renamo stronghold, on October 17.
The attacks on the former rebels then degenerated when government forces attacked Renamo’s bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group’s leader, and Fernando Mazanga, the Renamo’s spokesman, according to the Financial Times.
The government makes Renamo responsible for triggering the conflicts, and accuses her of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has sought to minimize concerns about instability.
Mr. Guebuza told AFP on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama considered himself a "loser" who wanted to use "all the forces he had left to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government."
Frelimo and Renamo insist that they both want to avoid war.
But concern grew after Mazanga said Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace deal.
He told FT that he meant that the agreement was no longer respected by Frelimo.
“We want to resume negotiations, but with the utmost seriousness,” Mazanga said.
Previous discussions between the parties have failed to alleviate tensions fuelled by a series of conflicts this year.
“These are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who do not stop arguing,” said Joseph Hanlon, an open university lecturer and specialist from Mozambique.
None of them know how to negotiate well and none of them are willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which is in favour of electoral reforms, had already said it would boycott municipal elections due to take place in November.
The presidential and legislative elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted its use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to obtain concessions and a treasury of war from the government.
The share of votes collected by Renamo has been decreasing since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was created by a former member of Renamo, is expected to get a larger number of votes in the elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza – who is due to retire at the end of his second term next year – wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn’t want multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to leave the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is not known exactly what Renamo's capacity is, but it has carried out disruptive lightning strikes on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south highway.
Most of the hangings took place in the province of Sofala, which is several hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port from which mining companies, notably Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio was unable to use the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was falsely shy when asked if Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,” Mazanga said.
The instability has heightened the government’s frustrations, said Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, with many also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of kidnappings.
"People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country, and that it is up to the government to find solutions to the problems," he said.
Omar Sultane, a protester, said people only wanted stability.
“Nobody cares about the Renamo or the Frelimo, they just want to find peace, they want to have free access to the roads,” he added.
Myths and legends should be taught to children as “lifestyle models,” says the author.
The Legend of Thor could show that "brutal strength does not make weight in the face of subtle cunning", while Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be “far too violent, far too scandalous, and in some cases, far too obscene to be taught at school,” Crossley-Holland advocated a “mindful selection” of age-appropriate works.
“I think it’s great that in America, myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I have been advocating for this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that the authors and teachers are “openly didactic” makes the children “full-fledged”, the messages being “sublimated” in pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said, "You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight."
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or end well, but there is an innate sense of good and evil.
And it must be sublimated; revealed through a story rather than declared.
The known basis of what is shown and what is not said.
One fighter from the Hamas armed branch was killed this evening and another wounded by an Israeli tank fire in the Gaza Strip, medical and security sources in Gaza have learned.
According to the sources, these activists were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian territory and Israel when they shot at an Israeli armored vehicle.
NSA spying: U.S. ‘goes too far’, admits Kerry
The United States has sometimes gone "too far" in espionage, Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged, in Washington's first confession in full polemic with Europe on the National Security Agency's (NSA) massive data collection.
After ten days of scandal, revelations and denials between the U.S. and its European allies, this is the first time a U.S. government official has explicitly admitted controversial practices in NSA interception of communications and data in Europe.
"In some cases, I concede to you, as the president has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we will make sure that this does not happen again in the future," Kerry said at a conference in London that he attended from Washington on Thursday, October 31 via video link.
In his retransmitted speech, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the head of U.S. diplomacy has long justified the practices of intelligence and information gathering through the necessary counter-terrorism and prevention of possible attacks.
Invoking the attacks of 11 September 2001, the attacks in Madrid in March 2004 and the attacks in London in July 2005, John Kerry said that the US authorities had since thwarted many plans of attacks, through the interception of communications and the collection of information.
“We actually prevented planes from crashing, buildings from exploding and people from being murdered, because we were able to be aware of these projects ahead of time,” he said.
And, John Kerry told Europeans, “I assure you that in this process innocent people have not been deceived.”
But we are trying to gather information.
"And yes, in some cases it went too far inappropriately," he said, adding that he had already had to speak out on the international scandal on a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He said on Thursday that President Obama was “determined to try to clarify and that he is reviewing these practices so that no one feels wrong.”
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to swell this week with new revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, the NSA intercepted data from hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The paper, which cites documents obtained from former NSA consultant Edward Snowden, says the program, dubbed “MUSCULAR,” and run with the British NSA counterpart, the GCHQ, allows the two agencies to retrieve data from the optical fibers used by internet giants.
According to one of the documents, some 181 million items had been collected in the month of January alone - ranging from metadata on emails, to text items or audio or video documents.
These interceptions would take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have denied any link to these practices.
In recent days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain and Italy have revealed that the NSA has massively intercepted data and communications from U.S. allies and their leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with the anger of European states and while leaks in the US press claimed that the US president was not aware of such wiretapping, Barack Obama refused to comment on it, citing national security.
On the other hand, the boss of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, has denied that his intelligence agency has captured tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even returned the bullet to the European intelligence services that allegedly seized these communications, before providing them to the NSA.
This would involve “military operations” in countries where these NATO allies are cooperating with the United States and it would not be aimed at Europe at all, General Alexander said.
And the controversy spread to Asia on Friday.
Indonesia has summoned Australia's ambassador, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast international spy network that has also sparked China's ire.
Paris Saint-Germain will receive Lorient on Friday without its master asset, Swedish Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, the Ligue 1 club said in a statement.
The PSG, leader of the championship ahead of Monaco in the difference of goals, has released the list of players selected for this match of the 12th day, without including the 32-year-old striker.
The statement simply states that he is "blessed", without specifying the nature of the injury.
However, he suffered from an inflammation of the left knee when he returned to his selection, at the beginning of the month.
A ceremony in memory of the cremated dead
The crematorium of Father Lachaise organizes, at 11:00 a.m., a lay ceremony, in memory of all the deceased cremated in his establishment, during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a socialist candidate for the Paris City Hall, is expected to attend, and will then explain her funeral proposals at a press conference.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own funerals, more and more French people choose cremation, rather than burial: 53%, according to an Ipsos study conducted on September 6 and 7 among 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For funerals of a loved one, the opposite is true: the French prefer burial (53% vs. 47%).
If they are unlucky to lose a child, they are only 15% to choose cremation.
In his book Death in the Ashes, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-president of the National Funeral Ethics Committee, stresses the "violence" that cremation constitutes for survivors.
There is, with cremation, "a violence done to the beloved body", which will be "reduced to a pile of ashes" in a very short time, and not after a process of decomposition, which "would accompany the phases of mourning".
There is also "symbolic violence", which is due to the "erasing of singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to the "anonymity" of ashes.
Why is what is easily accepted in some Nordic and Protestant countries still badly lived in France?
“Because cremation is a new fact,” says Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Society of Thanatology and author of the book Appropriating Death.
It has only been tolerated by the Catholic Church since 1963, which has limited attempts to tame it.
To tame the cremation, it is for Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Michaud-Nérard, Director General of the Funeral Services of the City of Paris, to provide for the deceased a ceremony as dignified as that to which he would be entitled with an burial.
The annual Ipsos survey shows a very strong commitment to the organization of the ceremony.
77% of French people want one, for their loved ones, whether it is religious (53%), or civil (24%).
Now, 73% of people who chose a cremation wish to organize a ceremony.
66% of atheists or non-believers also want it.
The crematoriums have adapted to this evolution of society.
"For about ten years, they have been trying to avoid the violence of waiting for families, without doing anything, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the handover of the ashes," observes Mr. Michaud-Nerard.
70% of the establishments now offer masters of ceremonies, who proceed, in the presence of the body, to the following ritual: to welcome the assembly, to name the deceased, to connect him with others, to evoke him, to give meaning to his death, to organize the farewell.
This has been the case at the crematorium of Father Lachaise since 1998.
Ceremonial masters are often people who have converted.
There are also former Catholic priests.
It is in this context that the crematorium of Father Lachaise organizes, since 2010, the day of La Toussaint, several ceremonies of remembrance, secular and non-religious, to which it invites the families of people who have been cremated in the year.
For the second year in a row, one of these ceremonies is broadcast online, to the attention of those who could not make the trip.
The crematorium allowed us to relay it.
In La Seyne, the relocation due to rats turns to controversy
Earlier this week, a family left their ground floor apartment in the Fructidor D2 building due to the presence of rats.
In view of the urgency of the situation, the Director of the Southern Habitat Land Office has proposed, exceptionally and provisionally, to relocate the couple and their three children in a new T4.
Yet the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case has taken on exaggerated proportions, says Joël Canapa, the director of the office.
There have always been rats in cities.
The deratization company performs two passes per year, and in addition, we intervene, at our expense, at every request of the inhabitants.
Since the end of last winter, we have carried out 64 interventions.
The neighborhood is not abandoned, and rats do not roam the city.
For reasons of environmental protection and public health, deratization products are four times less effective than in the past, of course, but for two rats, we are not going to kill a kid.
"We didn't invite the rats to our home," said the father, who left his home to move to the hotel.
We are soon without the money and we are waiting for a new housing, at the same rate as the old one.
Tokyo Stock Exchange Ends Down 0.88%, News
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended down on Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The rating suffered from the decline of the dollar against the yen, detrimental to export values and the warning on its annual result launched by Sony on Thursday.
The Nikkei index lost 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14,201.57 and the Topix lost 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1,183.03.
Sony has dropped more than 11% to 1,668 yen.
A house caught in flames in Old Quebec
A fire that broke out Friday noon in Old Quebec was quickly contained.
More than 30 firefighters were dispatched to 9 rue Hébert.
The flames broke out in a house of three dwellings spread over four floors located behind the courtyard of the Seminary of Quebec.
All the tenants were absent during the fire.
The fire was controlled an hour after the arrival of the firefighters, who were many to intervene.
As soon as our first firefighters arrived, they really saw apparent smoke.
"Then the alarms followed, because it took reinforcements to attack the building, because it's buildings glued here," said France Loiselle, a spokesman for the Quebec fire department.
An investigation is underway to find the cause of the fire.
Ben Greenman: 10th Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that New York City is the birthplace of the stand-up in America: almost 100 years ago, the vaudeville actor Frank Fay, who played the role of the master of ceremony at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly in front of the audience, on the tone of the conversation.
Fay’s innovation has continued over the years, until it was picked up more recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Carolines stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows presented in small clubs and large theaters.
“Most of the headliners emerged in the Carolinas, and were a huge hit, until they became too famous to play in a club,” Hirsch said.
We created this festival with the aim of being able to continue working with them.
This year’s event will see the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of “Stand Up for Heroes”, a comedy and music evening for veterans, organized at Madison Square Garden, which will include Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The festival has grown, as has the world of comedy.
Several of the actors participating in this year’s festival went through non-traditional circuits, for example presenting shows on small TV channels, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll appeared on the front of the stage in a sitcom on a cable channel (“The League” on the FXX channel’s joyfully lascivious fantasy football theme) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate participated in the show "Saturday Night Live" and was part of the cast of the series "Parks and Recreation", but she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with the singular voice (the surrealist pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic advocate of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attractions of the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg talking with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but he became an accomplished film and television director, as well as an unofficial comedic historian.
Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a TV Land show called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg".
The appointment takes place at the City Hall in downtown Manhattan.
“The city is definitely in the comic DNA of all of Larry’s work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he was here, sometimes he would walk down a alley between two buildings and say, "Well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll come and live here."
Oil price continues to fall and approaches $96 a barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday as concerns over the size of stocks offset a report showing that China’s electricity-hungry manufacturing sector is strengthening.
The price of the U.S. reference crude for delivery in December fell from 14 cents to $ 96.24 a barrel at the end of the morning in Europe during electronic exchanges on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it with a 5.8% drop for the month of October.
The abundant supply of crude oil has weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturing sector arrived on Friday, which show growth in activity, suggest an increase in demand.
This suggests that China’s economic recovery could continue to bolster after growth jumped to 7.8% in the third quarter, after a decline that had not been seen for two decades in the previous quarter.
Brent crude, a benchmark for international crude already used by U.S. refineries, lost 26 cents to fall to $108.58 a barrel on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Questioning the Right to Abortion in Texas
A federal appeals court in Texas re-established some restrictions on the right to a voluntary termination of pregnancy that had been blocked by a trial judge this week.
This ruling means that a bill passed in July in that state that largely calls into question the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
The ruling by the Court of Appeal means that doctors who practice IVG will need to have a "admission privilege" with local hospitals.
The admission privilege is the right of a physician, under his/her status as a member of a hospital care, to admit a patient to a hospital or medical centre for the purpose of providing a diagnosis or treatment.
Advocates of the IVG argue that the content of the law could result in an immediate closure of one-third of state clinics because these clinics have failed to obtain this "admission privilege" for their practitioners.
In total, nearly 22,000 women would be deprived of access to these facilities.
On Monday, a first-instance judge ruled on the eve of the law's entry into force that the provisions dealing with admission privilege were unconstitutional.
But the Texas Attorney General, Republican Greg Abbott, who is running for governor, has asked the appeals court to quash the first-instance judgment that blocked enforcement of the law.
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
The New Star achieved a strong return on the audience side, with 1.3 million viewers behind their TV station, or 5.6% of the audience.
But was the show at the rendezvous?
Some 10,000 candidates presented themselves at the hearings of this 10th season, to face the jury: Maurane, the evil Sinclair, the perched André Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
After the excitement of resuming their favorite program, many were disappointed.
But why so much disappointment?
No candidate seems to have really scored on this first prize.
As every year, the first audition shows brew a wide selection of up-and-coming singers, for the best and sometimes for the worst.
Now, on Twitter, we want show, emotion, originality, music...
Fortunately, some of them found their account.
There are many who have tried the New Star, and sometimes even gone to the end.
Behind the TV screens, the vocations of successful singers are still there, season after season.
Others just have the ambition to make you laugh.
Court blocks decision on NYPD’s search and control policy
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a judge's decision demanding changes to the New York Police Department's control and search program and dismissed her from the case.
The U.S. Court of Appeals (Second Circuit) indicated that Judge Shira Scheindlin’s decision was suspended until the city’s appeal came to an end.
The judge ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its program to monitor and interrogate citizens.
The city appealed its findings and corrective orders, including a decision to assign a controller to assist the police department in changing its policy and associated training program.
On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal heard arguments about the request for suspension.
The appellate court said the judge should be dismissed from the case because she violated the judges' code of conduct by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, in part due to a series of media interviews and public statements in which she publicly responded to the court's criticism.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by mistakenly targeting black men of Hispanic origin as part of their control and search program.
It appointed an external controller to oversee changes, including policy, training and oversight reform, and ordered the establishment of a pilot program to test body-worn cameras in the neighborhoods where the largest number of controls take place.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the practice of retaining the names and addresses of people whose case is dismissed after a police check.
The hearing of the city’s appeal is expected to take place after March 14, 2014.
The tactics of control and excavation have been criticized by many civil rights defenders.
This control and excavation system has existed for decades in some form, but the number of recorded checks increased dramatically under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, to its highest historical level in 2011 with 684,330 checks that concerned mainly black men of Hispanic descent.
A lawsuit was introduced in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and turned into a collective action.
Proponents of changes to the NYPD's control and search program say they will end unfair practices, have more effective and trusted police forces, and be able to change the way police departments use policy.
Opponents say these changes would undermine the morale of the police without lowering crime, represent a waste of money and would not solve the wider problem of police forces under pressure after the police force has been severely reduced over the past decade.
The judge emphasized that she was not putting an end to constitutional control and excavation practices, but was reforming the way the NYPD was implementing its controls.
Tenants must go to vote, as each of them pay an average of $100 per month on the price of housing that goes into taxes to the City.
When the landlord pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides that amount between each dwelling.
We are obliged to increase rents to help us pay the new taxes.
When we vote, we send a clear message.
We need to change things in the city.
All the candidates told us that they would tackle the scandalous debt.
We no longer have the means to pay for $100,000 in fireworks, $4 million to $5 million in case...
Go vote, that's the best way to express yourself and say that's enough.
End of service for the chef of the Elysée
Entered the 500 m2 of Elysian kitchens as a clerk after working in embassies, the cook climbed all the stairs until he became a chef nine years ago.
He served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande to Nicolas Sarkozy, including on their vacation spots, and fed an incalculable number of the greats of this world in a quasi-anonymity that he only breaks today, at the time of retirement, at 60.
The man with the open face, disfigured skull and intellectual glasses, born on October 24, 1953 in the Ferté-Saint-Aubin is the holder of a pastry shop.
Her mother was herself a cook in a castle in Sologne.
"I've gone from one castle to another!" says Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the manias of the six presidents for whom he served, but also of their wives and some of their illustrious guests.
"It is always the head of state or his partner or wife who chooses the menus," he recalls.
"Mrs. Chirac was a little more involved, she came directly to the kitchen," to the point that she had banned women in the kitchens of the Elysée!
It does not displease heads of state who showed a relative indifference to land-based food, "they are all greedy," kindly denounces Bernard Vaussion.
Jacques Chirac certainly had "a slightly more developed appetite".
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the cheese, the plates came back empty!
As for Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande, who restored the cheese, "it's someone who likes to eat" and "there's not much he doesn't like".
The current head of state, who regained the kilos lost before the presidential campaign, "has no demand for a specific regime."
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure that weighed on his shoulders, especially at state dinners at the Elysée: it is necessary to serve "between 200 and 250 people in about an hour".
The night before is almost white.
These people would not understand that there are mistakes.
The now former chef of the kitchen of the Elysée, who took a drink Tuesday night with his team, his family and friends, leaves with a pinch in his heart.
He said compliments.
“His human side came out,” he says.
The chief will be replaced by his deputy, Guillaume Gomez, 35, who has been at the Elysée for seventeen years.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec City
A historic house built in 1850 was the prey of flames in Old Quebec on Friday noon.
The four-room building, located at 15 rue Hébert, was the subject of three fire alarms from the fire department.
The fire declared itself at the front, but rose on the three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, a spokesman for the Quebec Fire Protection Service, said the rapid firefighters' intervention helped prevent the spread of flames to adjacent buildings, a major challenge for this area of the city where buildings are built in close proximity.
The burned house housed four dwellings, but no tenants were on site at the time of the fire.
The damage has been limited, even if the water has caused damage.
An investigation will be conducted to determine its origin, but the sappers rejected the thesis of a criminal act.
The Wolf of Wall Street: Release of the Second Trailer
Martin Scorsese lets out some images of his next film, whose title role, that of an ambitious New York broker, is played by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget to be reasonable and take out your tickets.
Leonardo DiCaprio will decouple you in his role as a mischievous trader.
Martin Scorsese tells the true story of a “Long Island stockbroker who refuses to cooperate with authorities in a vast Wall Street corruption case.”
In the 80s, Jordan Belfort then mounts a scam that will make him a rich, very rich man.
The opportunity to follow its incredible ascent, but also the dizzying fall that will follow.
Without limits, the man chained the parties, the women, the drugs.
Decadence and excesses of all kinds are the master words of this crazy story.
The Scorsese-DiCaprio couple seems to have found the magic that had brought them together in Shutter Island.
The release of the new Scorsese has been delayed due to its too long assembly.
It looks like the movie is going to last 2 hours and 45 minutes.
On December 25th, he will be able to participate in the Oscar race.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a pipe
Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson reportedly used “phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation” to try to confirm a canned pipe on a liaison involving then-incumbent Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Attorney Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey court that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, his “nice special counsel.”
It was reported to the court that the newspaper charged Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator, to hack Pawlby's voice box and "permanently plant in front of her door," but Coulson also called her and left her voice messages.
“The prosecution suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor-in-chief of NotW, is not the kind of man who stays in front of people’s house hoping to surprise them, it’s the kind of man who likes to present the story to people to see what they’re saying,” Edis said.
He said NotW was using three ways to investigate the issues: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor-in-chief is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that he is aware of the second, surveillance, he can not be otherwise.
But what about the first one?
Does he know about phone piracy?
He says the opposite, but we say “Of course if”.
Rumors about a connection involving Clarke were first echoed by NotW's editorial office when a source, feeling a sexual attraction to Ms. Pawlby, said she had been told, "Don't waste your time with her, she's with Charles."
A tape, on which pirated voicemails were recorded on his phone at least three times, was seized at Mulcaire's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found seizures on the private investigator's computer that concerned Ms. Pawlby and her sister stored in a "Projects" folder.
During the period when the detective investigated her, Ms. Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Edis added.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw the monitoring of Ms. Pawlby's slightest facts and gestures.
In a voice message he left on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, “I have a story we plan to publish tomorrow that I would really like to talk to Charles about.”
Mr. Edis explained that Coulson's involvement in the story followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr. Blunkett about an affair with a married woman while he was dating co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks denied colluding with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to conducting phone hacking.
Barack Obama welcomes Iraqi Prime Minister in the midst of violence
The U.S. president was scheduled to receive Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki on Friday, November 1, 2013, seeking help from the United States to fight the strongest wave of violence in five years.
Iraq experienced its deadliest month in five-and-a-half years in October, according to figures released Friday by Iraqi authorities.
964 people died in the violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 police and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured.
The United Nations is giving an even higher score with 979 dead and 1,902 injured.
The violence is becoming more and more deadly despite increased security measures and large-scale military operations launched in recent months by the Shiite-dominated government of Nouri Al Maliki.
The total death toll in October is the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people had been killed.
About two years after the withdrawal of U.S. troops, the level of violence raises fears of a new embracing as neighboring Syria is in the grip of a civil war.
The bombs hit markets, mosques, weddings and funerals.
Men are shot dead in the street or even at home, and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing discontent of the Sunni minority, in power under Saddam Hussein, who complains of being politically marginalized and being the target of unjust arrests, has fuelled this outburst of violence.
On Friday, further violence killed four people in northern Iraq, the day after at least 26 people were killed in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five cars trapped north of Baghdad.
Much of the violence has been blamed on the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), a group affiliated with Al-Qaeda (Sunni extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a “world war” against Al Qaeda.
The violence is at the heart of Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki’s talks in the United States, which will be hosted by President Barack Obama on Friday, two years after their previous meeting on December 12, 2011.
At the time, the American president, elected on the promise of ending military engagement in that country, had drawn an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since his arrival in Washington on Wednesday, Nouri Al Maliki has multiplied meetings with the executive, and congressional officials.
On Thursday, he pleaded for the international community to wage a "third world war" against al-Qaeda.
The principle of increased security assistance to Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democratic senators.
But the latter also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shiite, attributing him partial responsibility for the resumption of violence through his "sectarian and authoritarian policy".
They also demanded that Barack Obama make it clear to Nouri Al Maliki that “Iran’s pernicious influence within the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship.”
Beijing accuses Uyghur group of attack on Tiananmen
China’s interior security chief on Friday accused a group of Uighur separatists from Xinjiang of being behind the car bombing that killed five people in Tiananmen Square in central Beijing on Monday.
The vehicle, an SUV, sunk into the crowd that stood on the famous square of the Chinese capital, symbolizing the deadly repression carried out in 1989, and caught fire killing its three passengers and two passers-by.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau in charge of domestic security issues, accused the Islamic movement in eastern Turkestan of being the instigator of the attack.
Many Uyghurs, a Turkic-speaking minority settled in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province Eastern Turkestan.
For the Chinese government, this movement is responsible for the frequent eruptions of violence that occur there animated by independenceist claims.
“The violent terrorist incident that took place in Beijing was organized and premeditated,” Meng told Hong Kong’s Phoenix TV.
“The group that was behind the scenes was the Islamic movement in eastern Turkestan,” he added, as his remarks were echoed by the new China news agency.
Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests he is of Uighur origin and said his wife and mother were with him in the car.
The latter also contained tanks filled with gasoline and a flag with Orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident left 42 people injured.
The Islamic movement in eastern Turkestan is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
Vatican probes contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken a major survey around the world on how parishes handle sensitive cases such as contraception, divorce and same-sex couples.
The survey asked participants how priests deal with gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by the bonds of marriage.
The survey was sent to each National Conference of Bishops in mid-October, with the aim of getting as many responses as possible.
The information will serve as an important gathering on the family that Pope Francis plans to organize next year.
The news was reported Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent Catholic newspaper in the United States.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide on the appropriate way to probe parishioners.
In the UK, bishops published the survey on the Internet asking Catholics to participate.
DRC: the army attacks the last fief of the rebels
The irreducibles of the M23, a few hundred fighters, were cut off at nearly 2,000 meters of altitude on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonii and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jomba, two towns located about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province.
"It hasn't stopped since this morning, the fighting continues despite the night," a resident of Jomba told AFP, joined by phone around 12:30 p.m., according to which a girl was shot in the morning.
"The intensity of the clashes has decreased a little," he added, "it seems that the FARDC armed forces of the DRC have pushed back the rebels a little."
According to the witness wishing to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "stayed the night" in Jomba before going up to the front for a "scratching operation".
There was a clear sound behind him of cracks fed by light weapons.
From Bunagana, a political fief and the last stronghold of the rebellion that fell on Wednesday, an AFP journalist could hear heavy weapons detonations.
According to a source at the United Nations Mission for the Stabilization of the DRC, the fighting has entered “a final phase,” with the FARDC “encircling the remaining M23 positions to dislodge them.”
Since the resumption of clashes between the 23 March Movement (M23) and the military on Friday, MONUSCO has not participated directly in the fighting, but has provided government troops with decisive intelligence, observation and planning support.
At the end of the afternoon, several dozen soldiers, well supplied with ammunition, rose towards the front line.
They were armed with kalashnikovs and rocket launchers.
A little earlier, on the road leading to Bunagana, border post with Uganda, civilian-assisted military personnel were loading a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a brand new FARDC truck, having to ensure the upkeep of another machine piling the M23 positions on the hills.
Congolese President Joseph Kabila called on the rebels to "demobilize voluntarily" on Wednesday night at the risk of being disarmed "by force", but left open the Kampala process, where Kinshasa and M23 have been discussing since December with no result for the time being.
On the ground, M23 political leaders hope to reach an agreement.
"We have concluded the talks, it remains only for the Ugandan mediation to organize the signing," said Roger Lumbala, vice-president of the M23 delegation, without this information being immediately confirmed by the government.
The M23 was born from a mutiny, in April 2012, of former rebels, mainly Tutsi, who joined the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The UN and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the M23, which Kigali and Kampala refute.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions in the DRC, and its subsoil is full of coveted mining resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where about 5,000 people had taken refuge between Monday and Wednesday, according to the UN, the movement back to the DRC that started in the morning reversed by half a day.
"This morning we crossed over to go to our fields, but the military told us to back down," Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by her nine children, including a baby on her back, told AFP.
We have the impression that the shootings are getting closer to the population.
In the early evening, dozens of residents crossed the border, some with a mattress on their heads, to spend the night in Uganda.
The Musical Comedy, This Stage Beast
Classical, sophisticated, popular, in English or French, the sung and danced productions take their flight.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally finds its voice.
It is a revolution: the French musical asserts itself as a successful genre.
For a long time, from Notre-Dame de Paris to Mozart’s opera rock, most of the attempts were ridiculed.
And successes like Cabaret or Les Misérables bore the aura of mystery.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin at Ch<0xC3><0xA2>telet and Stage Entertainment at Mogador changed the game.
Today, these two scenes handle the titles as hits.
The first, this Christmas, resumes his excellent My Fair Lady and announces for the next the world creation of "An American in Paris".
In Mogador, "Beauty and the Beast" could well be one of the successes of the season.
On the other stages, musical performances such as "1789", "the lovers of the Bastille" and small musicals such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" put themselves at the forefront of success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "Histories of musical comedies" and lecturer at the Thé<0xC3><0xA2>tre du Ch<0xC3><0xA2>telet, analyzes the reasons for the success so hard conquered.
How do French musicals evolve?
The offer has multiplied.
First there are the "musical shows" that evolve at the will of the producers...
Some use beautiful projections of images and a true story as in 1789, the Lovers of the Bastille.
Others make a leap of fifteen years back under the pretext that you can serve pretty much anything when you have Matt Pokora at the head of the poster.
Afterwards, we have the musicals with the sumptuous productions of Ch<0xC3><0xA2>telet that make us relive the golden age of Broadway and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest living composer.
Stage Entertainment popularizes Anglo-Saxon musicals of variety by adapting them in French.
Independent French producers are trying to make a breakthrough.
But ongoing projects such as "Rent", "The Kiss of the Spider Woman" or "The Awakening of Spring" have a hard time being funded.
Do we have enough artists capable like on Broadway of singing, playing and dancing?
In Paris, when there are eight musical performances in a season, it’s a great year.
We have 200 talented artists who turn from projects to projects.
In the United States, the cradle of musical comedy, it is very different.
Young people are trained in these professions in many schools.
Jobs are numerous among the regional theaters, tours, Broadway, the off-Broadway...
The talent pool is as substantial as the number of positions to fill.
Why are tours in the province so successful?
With the exception of opera, the province remains the poor ancestor of culture in France.
Few plays go on tour and it is often boulevard theatre for adults and not young adults.
Musical performances fill that gap.
It is these same young people who love reality TV and what it produces as ephemeral stars...
Proposing beautiful young men (often talented) at the head of a musical show is the assurance of the enthusiasm of these young girls and often of their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these shows are wisely held by professionals who answer the questions.
These shows are highly anticipated when they arrive in a provincial Zenith.
The mayonnaise is grown in Paris and tasted by the provincials.
The show is designed to enter all major venues in France in the same form as in Paris.
A serious injured in an accident with a ghost driver on the Brussels ring
A road accident caused a serious injury on Friday morning at 5:30 a.m. on the inner ring of Brussels at the height of Hoeilaart, in the direction of Waterloo.
A driver's car was hit by a ghost driver, who is unharmed.
The ring was closed to traffic until 9:00 a.m. at the scene of the accident, as long as the road was cleared and an expert determined the circumstances of the accident.
However, this situation did not cause any traffic jams as the accident occurred at the Hoeilaart exit.
The circulation could therefore be diverted by this exit/entry of the ring.
A child seriously injured in an attraction in Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old boy was seriously injured in an accident at an attraction in Disneyland Paris.
His vital prognosis is no longer engaged but he is still hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat of the attraction "Pirates of the Caribbean".
It has been closed until further notice.
DRC: the army is preparing a new assault
Children play on a charcoal armored vehicle belonging to the M23 rebels in Kibumba, eastern DRC, on October 31, 2013.
The Congolese army was preparing on Friday for a new assault on the last strongholds of the M23 rebels near Bunagana, in the eastern DRC.
The goal is to dislodge the M23 from the hills that overlook Bunagana.
Yesterday we took the hill of Bugina, which overlooks that of Mbuzi.
Today, Mbuzi should fall on its own.
Only the hill of Runyonyi will remain.
"Chanzu's is not very strategic," North Kivu Governor Julien Paluku told AFP.
Mr. Paluku plans to travel to Bunagana on Saturday.
A political fief and last stronghold of the rebellion, this locality is located on the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was taken over by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred M23 irreducibles have been cut off at almost 2,000 meters above sea level on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonii and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and the nearby town of Jomba.
In Jomba, a resident who had reported close fighting Thursday throughout the day said the situation was "quiet since this morning".
According to him, a woman and her child were killed by the fighting the previous day and were buried.
One girl was shot and three others were injured, including one seriously evacuated by the FARDC, the witness said.
Since the resumption of fighting between the FARDC and the rebels on October 25, the two belligerents have given no record of the loss of life.
NSA Reveals Increased Business Paranoia About State Surveillance
On a beautiful day in late August, a German police helicopter flew over the British Consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany, at low altitude.
On the orders of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German national intelligence agency, its mission was to photograph the roof of the American outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media explain that the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and that the operation sparked an exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, the director of U.S. intelligence services, again insisted in September that the U.S. is not using its foreign intelligence capabilities to “steal the industrial secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, the consultant who became a whistleblower, began unveiling his inexhaustible treasure trove of information about U.S. surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders no longer know whether to believe the director on word.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and had access to data held by U.S. cloud storage service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have sparked more paranoia than ever before over state surveillance.
The revelation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone had been hacked, perhaps even for a decade, was the drop of water that overflowed the vase.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are probably also potential targets.
Snowden has made clear the intensive collaboration between U.S. intelligence services and businesses.
I believe that it is conceivable that this data should be used in their mutual interest.
“Germany needs to wake up,” says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents German IT SMEs.
German companies believe the U.S. poses as high a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by the consulting firm EY.
However, in all the documents released by Mr. Snowden, nothing to date indicates that the United States has passed on industrial secrets from foreign companies to American companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU does not have sufficient IT and Internet capabilities and believe that it should strive to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
A member of the German parliament says we should create a German Google.
All I can do is close my eyes and slowly open them again.
“This is not the right way to do it,” says Hasso Plattner, president of German enterprise software company SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we should not have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars, to farmers.
Anything but the IT industry.
Yet the scale and sophistication of U.S. spy agencies exposed by Snowden’s revelations have been a shock to some companies that hitherto thought China posed the biggest risk in terms of surveillance.
A major change is taking place in cloud computing as European officials have become aware that data held in the United States is governed by the laws of that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional organization, about 10% of non-U.S. members gave up their plans to use a U.S. cloud storage service provider after revelations about the U.S. Prism data exploration program.
Jim Snabe, co-director of SAP, said: “Our customers are asking us a question they didn’t ask us a year ago: where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they will stay physically in this jurisdiction?”
Many German leaders point out that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and that this data must therefore be kept at all costs.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
There's always been.
“This has been a recurring topic for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed in the context of the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, CEO of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us commercially and industrially just as we are spying on them, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders are generally unwilling to disclose the prevention measures they have put in place, in case that would leave the advantage to an adversary.
Big companies have long hammered the message that it is at least reckless to retrieve a free USB stick at a trade show or leave a laptop unattended in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, member of the board of directors of the automaker Audi, says that collecting mobile phones before board meetings, so that they can not be used as remote listening devices, has been a common practice for years.
The BfV of Germany advises its executives to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones when traveling abroad due to the risk of damaging the integrity of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are then discarded.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
“SMEs often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets from unauthorized access,” warns the BfV in a report.
The United States is alerting its own companies to the economic espionage activities of other countries.
The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) carried out in February by the United States cited France, as well as Russia and Israel, as second-degree culprits for carrying out acts of economic intelligence hacking, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a well-known German company believed that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, former director of French domestic intelligence, the DCRI, said in an interview this month: “The services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
The parents of a teenager from Georgia, who died in unusual circumstances, think that their son was murdered
The parents of a Georgian teenager whose body was found in a wrestling mat rolled into his high school gymnasium believe their son was murdered, the family's lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 stuck in a pressed rug standing behind the steps of his high school gymnasium.
The Lowndes County Sheriff’s investigators concluded that Johnson had died in unusual circumstances, but the family of the 17-year-old boy disputes these findings.
“They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered,” Benjamin Crump, the lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as stated in the sheriff's findings.
“They think it challenges all logic, the laws of physics, and common sense,” Crump added.
They are convinced that these findings were delivered for the sole purpose of covering the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
“They sent their son to school with a cartel and they gave it back to them in a mortuary bag,” he added.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several important questions remained unanswered.
What is the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll follow up on the facts, wherever they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
“I believe there is a sufficient basis” to open an official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson had died from “positional asphyxiation.”
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
“A number of questions still deserve an answer or confirmation,” he said.
Moore added that if he finds evidence to justify a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson’s death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday.
A judge in South Georgia on Wednesday ordered authorities to hand over all video surveillance footage that investigators had examined.
The teen's parents said they hoped the video footage contained clues to the circumstances of his death.
CDC publishes advice on child allergies for schools
On Wednesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a series of guidelines on how to manage children's food allergies at school.
This is the first series of guidelines that the U.S. government publishes, as the number of school-aged children suffering from food allergies has risen sharply.
One in 20 children in the United States today suffers from a food allergy.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in children had increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to sensitize teachers and staff to food allergies in children, and how to treat them in the event of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools have a stock of epinephrine – the most commonly used EpiPen branded auto-injector – to be able to react quickly in the event of potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
State legislatures have recently updated the regulations to make it easier for schools to have epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children can say, “I feel like something is stinging my tongue,” “I feel like I have hair on my tongue,” or “I have tingling on my tongue.”
The NSA case highlights the total lack of debate on intelligence
How to explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which on the one hand offends in public by summoning the U.S. ambassador on October 21, and on the other prohibits the overflight of the territory by the Bolivian presidential plane, based on the rumor of the presence on board of Edward Snowden?
In my opinion, there are two levels of response from the French government.
When Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande calls Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius summons the U.S. ambassador, they react to a real discovery, which is the extent of American surveillance on all communications in France.
Is it not surprising to read in the columns of the World a few weeks apart, on the one hand, the reproduction of the American diplomatic correspondence and on the other, a condemnation of the listening of the Quai d'Orsay by the NSA?
Wouldn't there be a vague hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral positioning, but the search for the interest and relevance of information that allows each citizen to forge an opinion.
When WikiLeaks lifts the veil on U.S. diplomacy’s analysis of political or other issues around the world, we consider that, in the view of U.S. power, it constitutes an important illumination.
When we describe American interception systems against French diplomacy in the United States, it is by no means to indignate us with this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Has France benefited from information provided by the NSA regarding terrorist operations aimed at our interests?
Can we deprive ourselves of American cooperation?
The introduction of powerful technological interception tools by the United States, but also by France, has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism for more than a decade.
Moreover, in this area, France and the United States, in particular, have put in place procedures for cooperation and exchange of information almost daily and which are described on both sides as essential.
As an example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas of Miranshah was reported to the French thanks to the means of the NSA.
France can be led, for example, to transmit entire blocks of data about the Sahel region to American services, and, in return - it has already been said quickly - the Americans can give information to the French about other regions of the world.
So the fundamental question behind this NSA case is not so much the ability or right of countries to provide themselves with interception tools, but rather the question of the total absence of prior debate, particularly within Parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the perimeter that should be theirs, and, ultimately, the question of violations of freedoms.
What is the real risk of the United States? a deterioration of its image?
We have to denounce them, I don't see how they can be punished.
The risk posed by Americans can be twofold.
The first is when their allies - and this has been the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes at the top of their state, have been monitored.
This is the case with Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have been strained.
Another effect may be more economical: more and more European or South American companies are reluctant, in light of the revelations, to entrust their confidential data to U.S. service providers subject to U.S. law, and therefore to the grip of the NSA.
Lastly, the vast movement of revelations by media outlets around the world, which helps spark a debate about intelligence surveillance practices that had hitherto been virtually non-existent, could prompt lawmakers, including Americans, to reconsider the powers they have given to their intelligence services.
Parents of intersex children can choose “indeterminate sex”
Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sex organs.
The male or female sex of newborns will no longer be rigidly attributed to them at birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to declare the sex of their child, authorizing them to enter an “indeterminate” or “unspecified” sex on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure on the shoulders of parents who could make hasty decisions regarding sexual reassignment surgery for their infant, and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
According to the BBC, an intersex person would have said years later, “I am neither a man nor a woman.”
I will remain the patchwork created by the doctors, bruised and flabbergasted.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, intersexuality being part of the group of sixty diseases diagnosed as disorders of sexual development, a generic term referring to people who have atypical chromosomes or gonads (ovaries or testicles) or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersex.
Sexual identification is still not well understood, but most specialists in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information to attribute it, then wait and follow the psychological and physical development of the child before considering a surgical act, if necessary.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist in New York who specializes in sexual identification issues, said the new German law “seems to be a good idea.”
Intersex children pose an ethical dilemma.
“Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require surgery, but this is not the case for most children,” he added.
It is possible to do a sexual assignment without surgery, and see how the identity develops.
The science of how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question of why this happens.
It’s like the mystery that surrounds gay people.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transgender or transgender people, since their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively that of a man nor exclusively that of a woman, but is generally both at the same time and not clearly defined as one or the other.
These characteristics can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characters (such as muscle mass, hairiness, chest and stature), primary sexual characters (such as reproductive organs and sexual organs), or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the extent of acts of harassment and violence and crimes motivated by prejudice.
Young boys of the non-compliant gender now have camps that are specially designed for them.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to register male, female or “third sex” on their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian woman, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to be recognized as "neutral" after winning her appeal that allows her to keep an "unspecified" sex for life.
German passports will feature a third designation next to M or F – X for intersex, according to the Interior Ministry.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still the subject of controversy, according to a report broadcast on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators from the deeply Catholic country signed a petition for “gender theory” to be removed from schoolbooks.
The U.S. website Catholic Online also opposed German law, writing that "since the world is dragged into a new reign where gender is a choice but where sexual activity is not one, two other pillars of civilization are overthrown."
In Maryland, the mother of an infant also stated on Baby Zone that she would prefer sex to be attributed to babies at birth.
“Parenting is stressful enough without additional restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s gender,” she said on the website for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, after the name of the magnificent Greek god who had a double sex.
And barely a decade ago, the medical community viewed the genre as a slate, which one can erase and on which one can redesign.
But now, many are questioning the ethical foundation of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors can be wrong, not knowing how a child will feel his sexual reassignment when he grows up.
“In the middle of the 20th century, this was called a psychiatric emergency,” Drescher said.
When these children were born, we didn't call the psychiatrist, we called the surgeon.
The dominant theory on how to treat children with ambiguous sexual organs was launched by Dr. John Money of Johns-Hopkins University, who considered gender malleable.
He dedicated the term “sexual identity” and argued that social and environmental signals – the way parents raise a child – interact with a child’s genes and hormones to shape it so that it is identified as being male or female.
But in a 1966 case, known as “John/Joan,” his theories gave rise to controversy.
He had advised the parents of a little boy whose penis had been cut during a sloppy circumcision to castrate it completely, also removing his testicles, and raising it like a girl.
“Money presented this as a successful transition case, but it wasn’t,” Drescher said.
At the age of about 15, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But at 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said some doctors “always repeat this pattern.”
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, those who survived these sex-change operations say “that they are not satisfied with the result.”
This is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male XY chromosomes but ambiguous sex organs.
Doctors couldn’t really tell if he had a wide clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a “satisfactory life” as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce underwent surgical removal of the external organ and testicles and was raised as a girl.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he underwent a vaginoplasty.
But depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he asked for his medical record.
What he discovered horrified him.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder (SDD) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for his sexual organs to develop.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, following a testosterone treatment and had his breasts removed.
The surgery made him sterile.
Today, he defends the cause of others in an organization called the Interface Project, which tries to normalize the perception of intersex people.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, general director of the California-based nonprofit Advocates for Informed Choice, fears that German law “invites labelling and stigma.”
"Many activists are concerned that German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and gives their child an 'indeterminate' sex," she said.
We are afraid that it will encourage interventions.
We think it would be better to assign a male or female sex, and wait.
But we didn't see what the law was going to give, so we can only make assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because “it allows adults to choose to be recognized under the appellation of third sex.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legal gender,” she added.
The German law concerns the attribution of sex at birth.
This is not a battle that young children should be fighting at that age.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist specializing in mammograms in Pittsburgh, whose daughter suffers from a sexual development disorder and who helps thousands of people in a support group, said the German law will "responsibly" parents and children.
Dr. Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Due to the failure of its androgen receptors, Katie has developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Katie, now 29, is married and an intern in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is sterile, she hopes to have children through adoption services or surrogate mothers.
“The law leaves some latitude to parents so they don’t have to make hasty decisions,” Baratz said.
This leaves them time to take some tests and understand them, and a time period before entering “male” or “female”.
So, everything is fine – you can raise your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being a parent.
You don’t have to rush for surgery that is irreversible.
“This puts children at the heart of the decision and alleviates the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid of not doing the right thing,” she said.
Finally, the child will decide which sex he/she feels most comfortable with – and that’s something great.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself.
Letta confident in the longevity of his government
Italian Council President Enrico Letta believes his government will hold until 2015 despite strong left-right tensions within the ruling coalition as the Senate vote to oust Silvio Berlusconi from his mandate approaches.
In an interview with the daily La Stampa, the centre-left leader said he had “strongly intended” to continue governing with his coalition until the upcoming 2015 parliamentary elections.
The upper house of the Italian parliament will meet later this month to decide the fate of the former president of the Council convicted of tax fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support for the government if the Senate, where he has more opponents than supporters, pronounces his impeachment.
But part of his camp, grouped around the National Secretary of the People of Freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated on October 2 last his refusal to yield to the injunctions of Berlusconi who already wanted to bring down the cabinet.
The L.A. Times reports that a U.S. Transportation Security Agency agent, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the exchange of gunshots.
Firefighters called at the scene said they responded to a call that said "multiple people were injured".
"Law enforcement is on the scene," the airport said on Twitter, as TV footage showed people evacuated in ambulances.
“There was a shooting,” a spokesman for the U.S. Transportation Security Agency (TSA) told AFP.
ABC's local antenna showed one person being evacuated on a stretcher, and a second being transported in a wheelchair.
The incident took place around 9:30 a.m. local time (12:30 p.m. in Montreal) at Terminal 3 of the airport, the airport also said.
The Los Angeles Times reports that Terminals 2 and 3 are being evacuated.
The TSA spokeswoman was unable to immediately confirm if one of his employees was injured.
All flights on arrival and departure from the airport have been suspended.
Israeli army kills Hamas member in Gaza-scenes
Israeli tank fire killed an Islamist Palestinian Hamas militant on Thursday and seriously injured another in the southern Gaza Strip, health officials said on Thursday.
A Hamas source explained that fighting broke out in the area as Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by your Palestinian mortar fire.
The Israeli military has only referred to "targeted action" in the area near a tunnel dubbed "terrorist" by the Jewish state, dug at the border and the discovery of which was announced in mid-October.
Report: Obama's campaign seen as dropping Biden for Hillary Clinton
The closest advisers to President Barack Obama have considered, in the utmost secrecy, replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most notable event featured in Mark Halperin and John Heilemann’s highly anticipated 2012 campaign book, “Double Down: Game Change 2012.”
The Times obtained a copy of the book to be released and reported Thursday night that close collaborators of the president had been conducting “deep group work and polls at the end of 2011” to see if Biden’s eviction could help Obama with his re-election as his hopes dwindled.
According to Times political correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book offers a detailed analysis of the work of senior campaign and White House officials, former White House Secretary Bill Daley, to measure what effect the replacement of the vice president by former Secretary of State Clinton could have on the election.
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been fiercely kept within the Chicago campaign headquarters and within the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president’s close advisers – including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina and former White House advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew the change was under consideration.
“Double Down” indicates that Daley led the charge to replace Biden, despite their “close personal ties,” before finally deciding against the change when the numbers showed that having Clinton on the presidential list “didn’t significantly improve Obama’s chances of success.”
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually been considering replacing Biden with Clinton.
“I said I had looked at a whole series of questions, and that was one of them,” Daley told the paper.
Remember that at that time the president was not in shape, and so we were saying, “Lord, what can we do?”
While Daley called the review “coordinated,” Martin told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had invested heavily to find out if the change would be beneficial during the election.
“Campaigns don’t spend a lot of money on polls and discussion groups unless they seriously consider taking action,” Martin said on AC360.
However, it is not known whether Obama was aware that his team was considering the replacement.
Martin said on CNN that he had asked Daley if his boss at the time was aware of the eventual reshuffle.
Although Daley said he did not think the president "was aware" of the eventual change, the former secretary-general admitted it was "possible" that Obama had known.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not definitively answer the question of whether the political polls had arrived on Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama didn’t know Biden’s eviction from the presidential list was under consideration.
“Maybe,” Martin said.
Do you want a fluo ice cream?
A British entrepreneur created the world’s first fluorescent jellyfish-based ice.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminescent snack.
He came up with the idea after reading a study on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically recreate the brilliant protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing the pH of the protein to make it glow.
Chris explains that since the ice cream starts to shine when it reacts to the warmth of the mouth, the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company Lick Me I'm Delicious, said: "It's something incredible but we're still only at the beginning in terms of production, and 2 grams of this stuff costs about <0xC2><0xA3>200."
The protein we use in ice reacts with the tongue at neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms up the protein, the pH level rises and the ice begins to shine.
We tested it over the past few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at the time of Halloween because it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect.
It’s probably the most expensive ice I’ve ever created because jellyfish luminescence is four times more expensive than gold.
Each ball costs me about <0xC2><0xA3>140.
But it tastes pretty good!
The Bristol-based Charlie Experimental Society is known for its unusual ice cream fragrances such as beer, cheese, beef, and gold leaf.
But his next creation is even more ambitious.
He added: “I would really like to develop an invisible ice.”
This is intrinsically impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up the ice cream, but I think I'll find a way to do it.
Ice uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed Died During Tai Chi Session
Singer Lou Reed died while doing tai chi exercises, his wife Laurie Anderson revealed Thursday in a letter published by the regional newspaper "East Hampton Star" and addressed to residents of the city of Springs, where the couple had a home.
The artist died last Sunday at the age of 71.
“He died Sunday morning as he was looking at the trees and performing the famous 21st tai chi movement, with his hands of musicians tearing the air,” writes Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was a master of tai chi, a Chinese martial art.
The singer's wife also explains that she had promised her husband, the week before his death, to get him out of the hospital and take him to their home in Springs, Long Island.
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in the last few years.
And even though we are city dwellers, this is our spiritual home.
“Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs about the pain and beauty of the world will convey to many people the tremendous joy of living that he had,” she added.
Lou Reed had a liver transplant last May.
Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, go to bed late and dress up to go to the neighborhood.
Today, I have become more timid.
For the past two years, I haven’t distributed a single candy and I certainly won’t do it any more this year.
But the stats show that I'm the crazy sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans — 158 million of them in fact — will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I’m looking forward to every Halloween party is the trends.
Costumes are expected to account for $1.2 billion out of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, inanimate sexy objects are furious.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy foods like pizzas, hamburgers, and carrots.
As for men, I expect to see many zombies, thanks to the TV series The Walking Dead, and I bet that the men of space from Daft Punk will be among our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most sought after costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's no harm in staying traditional.
We dressed our dogs last year and, to my surprise, they weren’t the only ones.
In fact, Americans are going to spend $330 million on animal costumes this year, according to the NRF.
That's a lot of curious dogs dressed up as hotdogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't glamour.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on candy this year, according to Nielsen.
This represents approximately 272 million kg of Hershey bars, lollipops, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
This is great news for the 41 million children who go candy hunting in their neighborhood, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, we're going to buy and, let's not tell ourselves stories, consume 41 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
Corn candies are the only thing you don’t want to eat; and yet nearly 16 million pounds are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
That’s about 9 billion grains of corn.
It is a mystery that I have not yet been able to clarify.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than haunted houses.
They have the best names, such as “Terror Behind the Walls” (which is actually a real prison), “Howl-O-Scream” and “The House of Shock”.
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the U.S., which generate about $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes those awesome photos of you pissing on that your friends put on Facebook and you can’t remove and on which a guy you like leaves a “nice head” comment.
Finally, let's talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Big Pumpkin when we were kids, and sculpting a lantern-shaped pumpkin is like decorating a Christmas tree — it’s something we’ve been doing since we were kids.
Fortunately for us, the “baby pumpkin trend” only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us carved these pumpkins and didn’t have to sit in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The lantern pumpkins that weave softly on the porch of your home probably came from Illinois, where 542 million pumpkins were grown this year.
If you’re looking to get more noticed, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try sculpting their 922kg pumpkin.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will set up an internal “bad bank” structure comprising 38 billion pounds (45 billion euros) of the most risky assets, a measure aimed at relaxing its relations with London and accelerating its reprivatisation.
The bank wants to reduce the proportion of dubious assets in its balance sheet from 55% to 70% in the next two years and hopes to have completely cleared it within three years.
RBS also said it would write a provision for depreciation of additional dubious claims of <0xC2><0xA3>4-4.5 billion over the quarter, a write-up related to the constitution of the cantonment structure.
RBS also specified that this internal restructuring would free up <0xC2><0xA3>10 to <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion in capital, thus strengthening its lending capacity.
The bank and London stressed that the "bad bank" would draw a line on the past, with the government in particular being accused of interfering in the management of RBS.
“We can now move forward, worry about the future and the 90% of assets that make up a really good bank and build a big bank for customers and for the UK,” Ross McEwan, the new CEO, told reporters.
Land Rover Announces Sponsorship of a Series of Rallyes
The interior features bucket seats and 6-point harness belts, as well as an Intercom system.
Among the options are improved brakes, a service that gives access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and vehicle storage between two events.
Drew Bowler, the general manager of Bowler Motorsport, said: “Rally enthusiasts who join Bowler have changed.”
They are not all experienced, some seek excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events.
We are really pleased to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and we are convinced that it will be a new way to try different forms of rallying in the UK and internationally, and to prepare for the rigors and realities of rallying raids.
We had a lot of fun developing the Defender Challenge vehicle – the championship is going to be really exciting.”
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February and the opportunity to participate in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighters were called to rescue a lost puppy after being stuck 15m above the ground on an unstable cornice in a quarry
Ruby, a Spanish cocker, had escaped after a serious road accident
She was spotted three days later by a person walking her dog stuck in the quarry
Firefighters descended as a reminder along the cliff to retrieve the dog and save her from certain death
A puppy was lucky enough to escape the worst after the firefighters were called in to retrieve him safely while he was perched 15 m above the ground on the unstable protrusion of a cliff.
Ruby, a 9-month-old Spanish cocker, escaped after a road accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being rescued in a quarry on Wednesday.
Its owners, 25-year-old Scott Alderson, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, went to Flappit's quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to find Ruby and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately sought out their lost dog and launched a call on social media sites after she disappeared in the career following a no-gravity accident.
At around 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a person with sharp eyesight who was walking his dog spotted Ruby on a cornice in the quarry, trapped 15 meters above the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton fire brigade rushed to the scene and came down as a reminder to rescue Ruby using an animal carrier to transport her to the top of the cliff.
Technical rescue specialist Andy Clayton said: “She was in a precarious situation.”
It was in the middle of the cliff, 15 m from the top and 15 m from the ground.
She absolutely did not move during the rescue – she was frozen.
But she's fine now.
She ate biscuits afterwards.
It was a very unusual call.
It's amazing that someone noticed the dog.
Technical assistance specialist Peter Lau said: “Ruby was very lucky to get away with it.”
She could have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for a check-up; her general condition was satisfactory, apart from exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms. Hall, of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, "I was terrified to see the relief."
At first I didn't think she was up there.
It was amazing to have him in my arms again.
The veterinarian said that if she had been too exhausted and fainted, she would probably have fallen.
The firefighters were amazing.
What they did was really brave.
We are so grateful to them, each of them was absolutely awesome.
Mr. Alderson of Keighley added, “We were afraid it would fall but it didn’t move.”
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe she was up there.
Mick Jagger says he never drugged Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview on an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she was a chorister on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" in 2004.
Perry said he had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, “He dragged me when I was 18.”
She added, “It was a long time ago, and he was very kind.”
In a statement on Thursday, a representative of Jagger, 70, said he "categorically denies having made any advances to Katy Perry."
The representative added: “Maybe she’s confusing him with someone else.”
Perry was one of the singers to make an appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
His new album, “Prism,” hit the top spot in the charts this week.
Beijing calls into question Turkmen Islamic movement
"Backstage support for the attack came from the East Turkestan Islamic Movement based in Central and Western Asia," the head of Chinese security agencies told a Hong Kong television channel, according to a video posted on Thursday night on a website.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), spoke in Tashkent during an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time a Chinese official has designated a particular organization after Monday’s attack.
According to Chinese police, three Uyghurs from the same family in the Muslim-dominated Xinjiang region, bordering several Central Asian countries, rushed their car loaded with gas cans against the entrance of the Forbidden City in Beijing, in a suicide attack that left two dead and 40 injured.
The driver of the car, his wife and his mother died in the car fire.
The Etim, which claims to fight for the independence of eastern Turkestan, formerly known as Chinese Xinjiang, was classified by the UN in 2002 as one of al-Qaeda-affiliated organizations.
The movement is often blamed by Chinese authorities for sporadic disturbances in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: Breaking Europe gives Scots a choice
Another day, another worrying story of independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European Free Movement Area in order to join the EU.
And that's what we hear about passport control in Berwick and a border of barbed wire along Hadrian's Wall.
While it is true that the Strathclyde newspaper reported the possible economic repercussions of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, this was not included in the headlines (and was to be expected).
Nor has anyone said that EU Member States spend a large part of their time circumventing their formal rules when it settles them.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment, a continued non-compliance with the rules would be a thin concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything it wants from the Scots.
This is a story that is not one of them.
And a story so old that it is now frozen: I first heard the nonsense that “independence means passport control” more than 40 years ago.
Yet an interesting point has been forgotten in this interpretation of an old dusty tale.
Why should an independent Scotland follow Europe’s instructions, in fact?
Why trade the yoke of London for the yoke of Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real news about Europe: the great post-war plan to unite Europe is definitely at an impasse.
With the euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead.
Across Europe, parties that oppose the EU or advocate the abandonment of the euro as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative Party for Germany, founded only this year and arrived from nowhere, garnered nearly five million votes in the September federal elections and has taken the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent to our Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
There has always been national opposition to the project of creating a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has marked a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, coupled with the strain on national economies through accession to the single currency, has led many people to think that Project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments experiencing excessive budget deficits – this was only true for Greece.
Instead, the European system has weighed on its members favorable exchange rates for German exporters – which German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the national currency, the countries of Southern Europe find themselves with an intrinsic productivity problem vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis Germany.
The only remedy is to make dark cuts in wages and public spending – encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond the current budgetary and monetary problems, there is a deeper unease related to productivity in Europe.
Following the “green” energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason to subsidize French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the US.
This is a cost constraint, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All the wage freezes in the world will not prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalized by a cheap American shale gas.
As a result, the revolt, especially in France, has become one of the great leaders of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport to its political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving the French economy to suffer.
The result: Marine Le Pen’s far-right party, the anti-European National Front, has just won a crucial by-election, sending the socialists back to power in third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the vote – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot start from the principle that a split from the right will automatically favor the left.
What does Marine Le Pen do with her new popularity with the French white working class?
It wants to use next year's European elections to create a single anti-currency and anti-European bloc within the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties do well in these elections, which is very possible, such a bloc could control the European Parliament for the first time.
This is what I think: very soon, the anti-European and anti-currency sentiment in Europe will unite and end up killing the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something that will look more like a free “Europe of Nations (sovereigns)” favored by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will regain their own currency.
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project, and I hope that it will soften its eyes to the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left behind in the Atlantic.
What about Scotland in all of this?
We can decide to be a region of the little England (essentially).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending Berlin and Brussels for a walk.
I believe that Scotland could accede to a freer European agreement provided that we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other countries with similar views would be easier in a non-federal Europe of Nations.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The Scottish SNP government is – and it should be noted – the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, as it won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the dark cuts proposed (and implemented) by the Chancellor of the Labour Chess, Alistair Darling, and the Coalition.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland now to vote for independence if it were to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Aging earlier
Studies show that African American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty age earlier than white girls.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is imminent
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts think the obesity epidemic could be a trigger for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is not as pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in family and child health issues.
Should a mother worry if her daughter’s breasts and pubic hair start growing at 7 or 8 years old?
At the American Academy of Pediatrics’ annual conference this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, a pedo-endocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young Americans and represent a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time reassuring parents — in general, that doesn’t indicate a rapid evolution to full puberty,” Kaplowitz said.
The obvious signs of development, such as budging of the breasts, hair under the arms and in the pubic area and body odors, appear earlier in girls.
But there has only been a slight advance in the age of first menstruation over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12-and-a-half years, while it was 12-years three-quarters in 1970.
“Once the breast has started to develop, it takes at least two or three years before the first periods appear,” said Kaplowitz, also the author of “Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem.”
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty will evolve.
There is a debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but it is considered “early” when breast development is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8.
In most cases, development slows down or stops – this is something a pediatrician can follow closely.
A faster progression may warrant tests by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the onset of the first menstruation and prevent other consequences: premature aging of the bones that can slow growth and a small size in adulthood.
Medication and hormonal treatment recommendations are based on the child's age, developmental rate, growth rate, and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious with drugs but acknowledges that “controlling puberty can alleviate some behavioral problems and the feeling for young girls to be different from others.”
The other big problem is understandable: Parents just don’t want their very young girls to have their periods.
“They fear the risk of pregnancy or even the way they’re going to handle hygiene issues,” said Kaplowitz.
“It was a shock,” recalls a woman whose daughter had her first period at the age of 10.
Even though there were signs and we had talked about the rules, she wasn’t emotionally prepared.
She came home from school scared and upset to be the first of her friends.
There are many theories brought to the public’s attention about the causes of early puberty.
Yet there is no consistent theory that the hormones contained in milk or other foods, the chemicals present in the environment, or the sexual messages conveyed by the media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz argues that the most credible hypothesis is that of the obesity epidemic.
He participated in a study on girls aged 6 to 9 years that linked the percentage of fat mass to the onset of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, African American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than white girls.
There are various explanations.
Globally, the mechanisms of early puberty seem to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate, through genes.
Another problem: Although boys have hair on the face and in the pubic area younger, the trend towards true early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors participating in the AAP conference emphasized the complexity of the issue.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common, even in infants and toddlers.
“We need to be careful about how we identify the true onset of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pedo-endocrinologist working at Goryeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician for advice on how to talk to their child.
“This may mean having a conversation earlier than expected,” Kaplowitz said.
If you stay calm, your child will generally react well.
Girls whose puberty is early should be reassured that even when it happens earlier than expected, the process is part of life.
Tribute to the Coen Brothers
"Inside Llewyn Davis" by the Coen brothers, Grand Prix of the last Cannes Film Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film about the 1961 Greenwich village and the folk music that was just beginning to resonate there, before the arrival of Bob Dylan.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography has just been the subject of a retrospective at the Cinémath<0xC3><0xA8>que fran<0xC3><0xA7>aise, had won the Palme d'Or in Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
In the absence of being able to hire Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen threw their dedicate to the rising star of American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33, but also to the pop planetary star Justin Timberlake.
In this humorous film where music is a central character and songs performed live, Oscar Isaac turns out to be an accomplished folk musician and singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves pop for folk music with a contagious jubilation.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left Daisy Mulligan's rich auras in "Gatsby the Magnificent" for less shiny clothes, a soft voice when she sings, but the swearing-in to the machine gun when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" tells about a week of tribulation of a folk singer who fails to break through and gets angry with the whole earth.
He accepts back-to-back foot replacements in the studios.
Without housing, he tours the sofas of his friends who still want to receive him.
An air of documentary
“His relationship with success is tortured, this is what we were interested in: a mixture of bad luck, a guy who is not there at the right time, who is not a careerist but integral, with self-destructive behavior,” said Ethan Coen, who was crowned with his brother Joel at several Oscars and awards in Cannes.
While Llewyn Davis did not exist, the two folk-musician filmmakers built their story on real-life personalities of the time such as folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the moment leading up to the advent of Greenwich village, this New York neighborhood called to become "the epicentre of the rise of folk music that would spawn international stars" as written by journalist Elijah Wald, a friend of Van Ronk.
The film then takes on the look of a documentary, from the dusty music label invading 33T unsold inhabited by an old unpaid secretary, to the musical choices of the studios of the time and the cafes where the singers performed.
The magic of the Coen brothers still works by integrating a funny character who constantly crosses the film: a gorgeous red-eyed cat, a fortune companion of Llewyn Davis.
Asked how he composed his character, actor and singer Justin Timberlake recalled having “grown up in Tennessee, swamped by blues and country.”
“My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me how to play the guitar,” he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if the work is needed to “be considered good,” “random can also kick-start someone’s career,” and “more and more today.”
Like Llewyn Davis who rejects any compromise on her music, the pop star explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to get stuck by anything that can keep us from expressing ourselves."
Gérard de Villiers, the author of "SAS", has died.
He never knew the word retirement.
The phenomenon of the French edition, Gérard de Villiers, who died on Thursday at the age of 83, had just published his 200th SAS, "The Vengeance of the Kremlin".
In February, The New York Times described him as “the author of spy novels who knew too much.”
He had just spent ten days in Afghanistan, the theater of the 198th and 199th opus of the famous series of espionage novels.
Decreased physically by a very serious heart attack in December 2010, he was travelling with a walker during this trip.
And before Afghanistan, he had also returned to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published per year, Gérard de Villiers, born on December 8, 1929 in Paris, ensured to ignore the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first of the series, almost half a century ago.
"There is no doubt that between 120 and 150 million countries are all confused," he said in March.
His Burmese cat on his knees, in the living room of his immense apartment of a building on Foch Avenue just steps from the Arc de Triomphe, the malicious eye under his white hair, he cited some of the languages in which the adventures of SAS were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, or Japanese.
“Not counting the pirate editions,” he added, designating a pile of books on the coffee table among the bronzes or ivory brought from 130 countries surveyed to locate his novels.
For the price of a pack of cigarettes, the reader is entitled to the traditional cover with the photo of a young woman with an advantageous chest, wearing a pistol or assault rifle.
Inside, his serene Highness Prince Malko Linge, a disenfranchised Austrian aristocrat and contract agent of the CIA to pay for the repairs of the family castle, throws himself into the clutches of all the villains of the earth, communists of the 70s and 80s, then jihadists from the 90s.
To each book, the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitics and exoticism, a few scenes of hard sex, a zest of violence and torture.
"I never had the pretense of being a literary author," explained Gérard de Villiers.
I consider myself a storyteller who writes to distract people to whom I do not send a message.
He worked “like the great pre-war reporters, like Albert London, who went on the spot and came back with real and long investigations.”
The father of SAS said "make a kind of geopolitical pamphlet".
“I’m constantly looking at my files (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before I leave,” added Gérard de Villiers.
On the spot, I meet journalists, including those of AFP, diplomats, people of the services that I have known for some for twenty or thirty years.
As a result, many of his SAS are often premonitory: so, a month before the attack on a Syrian regime command center that killed several senior officials, he had told the story in "The Damascus Road".
In "The Fools of Benghazi", he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command center in this city, the cradle of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980, he staged the assassination of Egyptian President Anouar El-Sadate in "The Cairo Plot", a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in Panic in Bamako, he recounted the 4X4 columns of jihadists based on the Malian capital.
I am not a guesser, defended Gérard de Villiers, I simply make assumptions from countries that I know well and, from time to time, some of my assumptions come true.
After these trips to often troubled areas, he settled for a month behind his 1976 IBM daisy typewriter "all of whose parts have been changed".
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page in the pen.
On the walls of his office are hanging AK-47 assault rifles, erotic photos and photos of the author with African warlords.
Regularly pinned for machismo by feminist leagues and for racism by human rights organizations, Gérard de Villiers dismissed these accusations in two sentences.
Some women are sexual objects in my books but others are beautiful, smart and brave women.
I am always welcome in Africa where I have a lot of readers.
Gérard de Villiers once said, “Malko Linge, like all heroes, has no age.”
He will not die or retire.
No more than me.
Airmen argue about the width of the seats while large controls are at stake
The dispute rages among major aircraft manufacturers over the width of tourist class seats on long-haul flights, paving the way for bitter confrontation at Dubai’s aviation show this month.
The conflict concerns the width of seats offered on long-haul flights to economy-class passengers – who are not always the most courted by airlines, but to whom the allocated space is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the aviation industry to put in place a standard that imposes a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in economy classes, but its major U.S. rival Boeing says it should be up to airlines to decide.
The dispute broke out as the airliners sought to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-haul aircraft, eventually hoping for a record order at the November 17-21 event.
The way the seats will be arranged in the rear of the aircraft – in particular, there will be 9 or 10 front seats – is essential for the economic performance of the “mini-jumbo” segment.
Boeing says its redesigned 777X will accommodate 406 people in seats more than 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus says the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economy-class seats 18 inches wide configured in rows of 9.
Aeronautical giants often exchange shots on technical issues by advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus is appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to take the lead on its competitors with more than 100 orders.
We were recently able to realize what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to the financiers of a photo showing three people against each other at the restaurant, entitled "Would you accept that?"
“Boeing offers long-haul flights in narrower seats than in regional turboprop aircraft,” said John Leahy, Airbus’ commercial director.
As eating habits change, people grow larger, but the seats in airplanes have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing's jumbo 747 defined modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the average American's weight increased by 10 percent from 40 to 49, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The average 21st century American’s waist circumference is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says its rival clings to a seat concept that dates back to the 1950s, when the circumference of the newly named “jet set” was narrower.
Airbus says it has ordered a study that indicates that an extra inch in seat width would improve sleep quality by 53%.
Boeing disputes Airbus' figures on seat width and says it is not up to manufacturers to decide how airlines balance ticket prices and equipment.
He also says that the study shows that the cabin experience does not depend only on the width of the seats.
“It’s really about bringing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do what they think they need to do to get their business done,” said Kent Craver, head of passenger satisfaction at Boeing.
They don’t want to be told what will make them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it is more about having some freedom of movement, but for suppliers, it is more and more a question that could affect their results.
Behind the dispute is a race to order aircraft for an estimated amount of at least $700 billion at the market price in the coming decades, enough to tilt the balance of US and European exports.
As Reuters first reported in July, the configuration of the seats is exactly what fuels the battle between the latest devices.
Airbus and Boeing are both claiming a 20 percent higher yield per seat in their latest two-engine long-haul models than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
The performance announced by Boeing depends in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and an original 777 model configured in 9 rows.
The gain in terms of unit costs is low compared to the device configured with 10 seats per row currently in service.
“Boeing is doing this to be able to accommodate more seats and make its aircraft more competitive compared to our products,” said Kevin Keniston, Director of Passenger Comfort at Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins configured with 10 seats per row in the existing 777s suggest that many passengers are in favor of a denser configuration, which can go hand in hand with cheaper fares.
“An 18-inch seat width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view, Airbus’ proposal is motivated by the threat of the 777,” said Mary Kirby, founder and editor-in-chief of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalog of suppliers from which airlines have to choose.
Plane sellers who tour the world even take a meter with them to check the competing configurations.
While offering comfortable aircraft, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with high-density configurations to low-cost airlines and for regional travel.
Airbus offers an A350 configured with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus underlined the need for greater cabin customization by offering wider sidewalk seats on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of modern large aircraft, experts say it is unlikely that its call to the aerospace industry in order to put in place a size standard for seats will end, but that it could make forget the 777X sales wave.
Oracle Shareholders Annoyed by Ellison's Salary
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted on Thursday against the compensation proposal for founder and CEO Larry Ellison, given the financial performance of its group.
The vote is not binding but tarnishes the image of Larry Ellison, the third world fortune just auréolated by the victory of his boat at the America's Cup.
The billionaire still holds 25% of the capital of the software group he co-founded 40 years ago.
Last year, Ellison received a negative vote on his salary.
The Oracle boss waived a $1.2 million bonus for the 2013 fiscal year ended in May due to the group’s poor performance, which missed its growth goals, but it received about $77 million related to stock options.
His fixed salary is only a symbolic dollar.
Over the 2013 fiscal year as a whole, Oracle’s net profit increased by 3.5% while the stock market price jumped by 27.5%, outperforming the S&P-500 index which rose by 24% at the same time.
New Nicotine Vaccine Could Suppress the Pleasure of Smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could suppress the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine addiction for life.
Further tests are needed before starting trials on humans, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first signs were encouraging.
“We really hope that this kind of vaccine strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop, depleting all the methods available on the market today, but find that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to carry the genetic information needed to design anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the cells of the liver, which then begins to produce a regular flow of antibodies.
The antibodies track all the nicotine molecules present in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which prevents the smoker from having his nicotine dose.
In the tests, vaccinated mice who were then given nicotine continued their normal activity.
But the mice that had not been vaccinated “were calmed,” the researchers said, a sign that nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines proved ineffective because they contained antibodies.
Injections had to be repeated so frequently that antibody levels remained high that they were too expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower as it transforms liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if the future vaccine for human use was completely safe, it could be given to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent any addiction to nicotine.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to quit smoking.
“They’ll know that if they start smoking again, they won’t enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine, and it can help them lose their bad habit,” he added.
British scientists said the results were interesting but pointed out that much more in-depth research was needed.
Pakistani Taliban leader killed by drone
The head of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a U.S. drone strike Friday in Pakistan, security services have learned.
The death of Hakimullah Mehsud has been announced several times in the past.
But officials of the intelligence, the army and the activist movement claimed this time that he had lost his life in the strike, carried out in the region of North Waziristan.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone strike," a senior security official said.
The day before, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, travelling to London, had informed the British government that discussions had been initiated with the Tehrik e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former New South Wales Labour Minister Joe Tripodi will be the subject of an investigation by the state’s anti-corruption regulator.
Former New South Wales minister Joe Tripodi denied having changed the commercial lease policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties located in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obeid had pressured several ministers of state to renew his leases in Circular Quay, where the Obeids own two restaurants and a coffee shop, after their expiration in August 2005, without a call for tenders.
It is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following testimony from Mr. Tripodi's former Deputy Secretary General, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.
During the years of discussions that began in 2005, the government pressed for the leases to be the subject of a call for tenders.
The tenants were against and also wanted longer durations.
In 2009, leases for Circular Quay businesses, which brought in about $2.5 million a year to Obeid, were renewed without a call for tenders.
Mr. Tripodi, who served as Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of tenders.
But he denied having changed his policy at the request of Mr Obeid, who, admitted Mr Tripodi, called for a change in the government's lease policy.
The transcript of telephone conversations presented to ICAC showed calls made in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived at the Ministry of Ports after working under Mr. Obeid at the Ministry of Fisheries.
“Was the topic discussed during these phone conversations the development of the commercial lease policy?” asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy to Tripodi.
“No,” replied Mr. Tripodi.
I don't remember what we were talking about, but at least it wasn't.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes are targeting Syria, officials say
Israeli warplanes hit a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, a military official confirmed to Fox News.
The official did not specify what the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has carried out airstrikes against missile cargoes in Syria.
Foreign workers holding a 457 visa may have to pass a “authenticity” test
The government is currently considering the possibility of introducing a “authenticity test” for foreign workers on a 457 visa while considering extending repressive measures.
The test, if adopted, would be applied according to a criterion intended to prevent 457 visas from being used to occupy unqualified positions or as a diverted means of bringing his family and friends to Australia.
A government working paper was unveiled today as Labour MP Maxine McKew denounced the government’s speech on foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia’s neighbors.
“Failing statements about ‘foreigners returning to the end of the line’ and ‘jobs for Australians first’ are an unpleasant return to a time when trade unions were demanding a protected labour market,” she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the work of the Whites had to be protected – and I wouldn’t be surprised that some countries in the region see it as an echo of this historical artifact.
The working paper outlines the 12 measures previously envisaged by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet with senior officials to discuss human trafficking, implemented five of the recommended changes, the others being under review.
If the “authenticity” criterion was adopted, a visa applicant could be checked for “whether the job offer is genuine in the event that the applicant is a personal relationship or partner of the owner or the person concerned within the sponsoring company.”
Companies could also be required to report the number of 457 visa holders after some of them, intending to sponsor a small number of workers, actually employed hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker reportedly died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat carrying asylum seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The man’s son, 9 years old, was traveling to Australia with him and has found some comfort since his father passed away Wednesday with an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was urgently transferred by the Australian authorities to the hospital on Christmas Island, where he died.
A study to multiply the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland was launched by the UK Government.
The work done by HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and northern England will start as soon as Phase 1 opens in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project “would bring the UK together.”
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "excited" to work with the British government on the project.
Phase 1 will cover a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and northern England up from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The UK government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to study rail capacity building and improving journey times for northern England and Scotland.
This must include the possibility of travel times between Glasgow and Edinburgh of up to three hours.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together.”
We are pushing the HS2 project because the benefits it presents are enormous.
Without it, we are faced with a capacity problem of our rail network.
But it is also about developing connectivity between the 18 major UK cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that the connections between them are better thanks to HS2.
British Secretary of State for Scotland, Alistair Carmichael, added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Carmichael to support “unequivocally” Scotland’s inclusion in the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: “The high-speed train has the potential to offer considerable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings the economic weight of Scotland in the overall high-speed rail network project across the UK.
“We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the UK government to explore options to bring the high-speed rail network to Scotland, creating a benefit for all and complementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line that the Scottish government is already planning.
“I look forward to reading the review report with the British ministers next year and we will then decide together on the next steps.”
Rules for the use of electronic devices on board remain in force in Australia
Australian air passengers will have to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing despite the U.S. move to ease electronic device regulations.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open for U.S. carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical flight phases provided they are in “airplane” mode.
Passengers can already do this during most of the flight, but many people find it difficult not to be able to access their e-books during takeoff and landing.
Australian carriers are reviewing the decision that requires U.S. carriers to do significant work to comply with the requirements, but have indicated that they do not intend to immediately change their procedures.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was reviewing the announcement but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in place in Australia.
“The CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices by air,” she said.
The issue is subject to regulation that obliges aircraft operators to ensure the maintenance of safety at all times and passengers to comply with safety instructions given by crew members.
Virgin, who has already told CASA about her intention to extend the use of her on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to a change, but said she would follow the regulator.
“We would welcome a review of the CASA that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really think it would improve the customer experience now that we have (the on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology) on our planes,” a spokesperson said.
Qantas said it is currently complying with the current rules.
“According to our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during takeoff and landing, and we do not intend to change that immediately,” she said.
The FAA decision applies to U.S. airlines.
However, we are still interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will look closely at the FAA decision and the reasons for it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will need to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as review manuals, training equipment, carry-on baggage schedules and instructions provided to passengers.
“As soon as an airline has verified the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use lightweight portable electronic devices, such as tablets, e-book readers, and smartphones at all altitudes,” the FAA said.
In the rare cases of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to turn off their aircraft during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier aircraft be safely stored under the seats or in the upper compartments during take-off and landing.
Pia: at least four injured in violent fight
The small town of Pia experienced an unusual fever on Thursday night.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a crowd of about 30 people, according to the testimonies collected...
On this Halloween day, the evening was agitated on the side of Pia where a row involving several people broke out on the side of the Post Office.
At least four minor injuries would be to be lamented.
Alert, the gendarmes went to the scene to separate the belligerents and ensure that the wounded were taken care of.
Singapore’s mortgage lenders take advantage of middle classes forced to tighten their belts
Janani Amirthalinga deposits a bracelet, a ring and a pair of gold earrings at a lien lender at the Bendemeer shopping mall in Singapore to pay for her daughters’ tuition fees.
“My husband and I just bought a house so all my money went into it,” says Ms. Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 from Singapore ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, demand is such in some parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is rising – that ValueMax, where it carried out its transaction, became the third mortgage company to be introduced to the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Providing jewelry is not only a quick way to get cash – $1,300 from Singapore in Mrs. Amirthalinga’s case – but it’s almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In general, Singaporean mortgage lenders charge an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% offered by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping mall.
However, mortgage lenders have the advantage of not asking for a credit check or proof of salary, and can unlock loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region turn to mortgage lenders as families feel the pressure of rising cost of living and over-indebtedness of households and consumers.
After five years of solid growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit fuelled by overly lax monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families turn to mortgage lenders to bridge the gap as their economies slow down.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's cited rising household debt, mainly stemming from rising mortgages, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
She said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest household debt/gross domestic product ratio in Asia.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80% of GDP, compared to 60% in 2008.
Economists also fear the high level of consumer indebtedness in Thailand, which recently emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed a continued weakening of exports and a slowing of consumer demand.
“The bottom line is that with rising costs, people in the middle or bottom [of the wage scale] are looking to supplement their incomes as well as they can,” said Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
The historically high prices of gold over the past two years have prompted people to pledge their personal belongings to reach the cash value of their jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70% of the items pledged in the city-state’s 200 bond shops are in gold.
People say, “The price of gold is high, let’s pledge Grandma’s gold chain and we’ll be back next month to look for her.”
In Thailand, EasyMoney, the largest lending store operator, has seen a 20% increase in the number of customers using its stores in recent months.
The increase is such in the mortgage lending sector that ValueMax, operator of the Bendemeer store and 15 other stores like this one in Singapore, plans to grow not only in neighbouring Malaysia – where it already has four stores – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, its CEO.
The company will fund them using 60% of the $66 million it raised this week when it was listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some low-interest lenders have shrugged off criticism for the exorbitant interest rates they practice, Ms. Yeah notes that collateral not only offers lower rates than other lenders, but also does not directly increase debt.
“Customers mortgage assets they already own, and monetizing their personal assets doesn’t increase household debt,” she says.
Assurance is increasingly socially accepted as a means to secure financing in the short term.
The people who go to the lenders on bail are also not only those who have financial problems.
Wealthy people from Singapore also go to ValueMax mortgage stores to pledge gold bars or Rolex watches, which can account for up to 60% of their cash purchase price.
We see customers from all walks of life.
“These may be wealthy individuals who need to borrow short-term for business or investment activities, or small businesses who have cash needs to go through a difficult path,” Ms. Yeah adds.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Pastor Accused of Child Pornography in Nova Scotia
A pastor who cared for young people in the Halifax area of Nova Scotia is accused of child pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, 30, was arrested Friday morning following searches at his home and the National Research Council office where he works.
The Baptist church at Timberlay, where the pastor was serving, said it was deeply saddened by the news.
In a statement, church officials said Mr. Hudgins had resigned.
The pastor was released under conditions.
In particular, it must not communicate with persons under the age of 18 and must not access the Internet.
He will appear in provincial court in Halifax in December.
He goes to the supermarket in Nazi uniform, before being chased out.
A man dressed in a Nazi uniform barred by a cuff with the gammed cross was asked to leave an English supermarket, with customers complaining to the management of the establishment that called the police, the store said on Friday.
“We received several complaints from customers, so we asked him to leave the store,” a spokeswoman for supermarket chain Asda said.
The store called the police to the rescue, but "by the time it arrives, he had already left without flinching," she added.
I was queuing when I saw a woman who seemed upset.
People were dumb-mouthed.
“You don’t go out on the street like this unless you want to get attention,” 60-year-old Rosina Rusin told Cambridge News.
This incident occurred on Thursday, Halloween Day, where it is customary to dress up as a monster, but it was difficult to know if it was a hoax.
A man from Cambridge claimed responsibility for the act on his Twitter account, where he posted images of Adolf Hitler.
“I’ve been wearing a black SS bracelet twice a week for three years at Asda,” Dutton said, explaining that he was suffering from “mental problems.”
$325 million rescue plan for Tasmania's health care system
The federal government maintains that the $325 million rescue plan for the shaky health system is accompanied by strict conditions to ensure that the state government will not waste the funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is currently taking “urgent measures” to end a crisis caused by the island’s aging population, the high rate of chronic disease and systemic constraints.
The funding, planned for 4 years, was decided after consultations with the government with Tasmanian Independent MP Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan that we believe will address the unique challenges the state is facing,” Plibersek said today.
The $325 million plan includes a $31 million campaign for non-urgent surgical operations.
2,600 additional operations, particularly in the field of orthopedic surgery and cataracts, will help catch up with the delay.
Funds are also earmarked for appointment-free clinics in Hobart and Launceston, improved external care, training of medical staff, mental health services and the deployment of electronic medical record systems in local hospitals.
“These investments respond to the idea that, according to frontline clinicians, this is the best way to treat the Tasmanian health system,” said Plibersek.
The Minister stated that the Government of Tasmania would be faced with a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The state will need to maintain current funding levels in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and prepare monthly reports on the sectors in which it spends the additional funds.
A three-person commission will be set up to ensure that the State provides services in the most efficient and efficient manner possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that $325 million will not count as much "unless it is followed by real reform to consolidate Tasmania's public health system."
However, he congratulated the government for responding to the urgent request for assistance that it submitted to the Prime Minister in early May.
“I hope the federal aid plan will make a significant contribution to removing Tasmania’s public health system from the blacklist,” Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional non-urgent procedures will largely reverse recent cuts.
But opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today’s announcement is a “solution of fortune.”
“The reason we’re here is because the state’s labor government has withdrawn $430 million from its health care system,” he told ABC TV.
You can't have a state government that rips out almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth that puts in $300 million, and pretend it's a bright day.
Mr. Dutton visited Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar of the rescue plan would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The adaptation by Guillaume Nicloux of Denis Diderot's novel boasts a remarkable artistic direction and a meticulous reconstruction of the period, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
Set in France in the 1760s, she tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebels, she confronts the limitless cruelty of a deliberately sadistic Higher Mother and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film is never about lubricity or sensationalism, and that’s the problem.
The conscientious solemnity of narration could also become a penance for the public.
Syria Has Destroyed Its Chemical Weapons Production Capacity, Says Oversight Agency
Syria destroyed equipment essential to the production of chemical weapons and ammunition filled with toxic gas, the international chemical weapons watchdog said on Thursday, as violent clashes raged in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are believed to be stored.
A group of Syrian activists also said on Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the civil war in the country nearly three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came one day in advance of the deadline for
1 November established by the organization based in The Hague ordering Damascus to destroy or "unusable" all chemical weapons production units and machines for mixing toxic gases and filling ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious timetable for the destruction of Damascus' chemical weapons by mid-2014.
Thanks to the destruction of equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to begin the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
It is estimated that the country has around 1,000 tons of chemical products and weapons, including mustard gas and the neurotoxic agent sarin.
The announcement was made as fighting raged Thursday in the city of Safira, which experts say is home to a chemical weapons production unit as well as storage sites, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
The group, which tracks the evolution of the human balance through a network of activists based in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Among them, it is estimated that there were 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, it is estimated that 29,954 members of President Bashar al-Assad’s armed forces were killed, of which 18,678 were pro-government forces and 187 were Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Among the dead, an estimated 2,202 were deserters and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
It has not updated this figure since.
About 2 million people had to flee the country due to the conflict.
Assad’s troops have been fighting the rebels, many of whom have been linked to groups from the Al-Qaeda network, in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory said on Thursday that there were losses on both sides, but did not provide any clarification.
The fighting has highlighted the importance of the dangers that chemical weapons inspectors face as they complete their mission, which is to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of a civil war that lasts, within tight deadlines.
A statement from the OPCW, which works closely with the UN, said its team was “now satisfied to have controlled – and seen destroyed – all of the declared critical production and machinery for mixing and filling.”
She added that "no further inspection activities were planned at the time".
Earlier this week, the inspectors said they had completed the first stage of the verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the last two sites due to safety concerns, inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW said the two sites were, according to Syria, “abandoned and ... that elements of the chemical weapons program they contained had been moved to other declared sites, which were inspected.”
It was difficult to know at first sight whether the Safira unit was one of two sites that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons, which was approved by the OPCW Executive Committee the following month.
“I commend the moral strength and courage you all have shown in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization,” said Director-General Ahmet Uzumcu, in a commentary published by the OPCW.
Now in its third year, the civil war mainly pits Sunni Muslim rebels against the Assad government and its security forces, which are supported by members of the Alawite sect, a branch of Shiite Islam.
On the other hand, the director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that there had been a strong explosion Wednesday at an air defense base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Anger over sentencing of one of Bali's bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali attacks reacted with anger to the sentencing of the last of the conspirators to be brought to justice, saying Umar Patek should be shot by an execution platoon.
Patek, who has spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of Southeast Asia’s most wanted men, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for his role in making explosive devices used in the attacks.
He could be released after 15 years on parole.
The 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder for the attacks targeting two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured many.
He has also been found guilty of many other charges related to terrorism, including a wave of attacks targeting churches throughout Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors have asked for life imprisonment, but they could have asked for the man, who has been dubbed “Demolition Man” for his reputation as a bomb-making expert, to be sentenced to death.
The decision has revived painful memories for June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her two 39-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, in the destructions perpetrated by Patek and the other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
On the brink of tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as the other men.
“He should be dragged in front of the execution platoon,” Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day without having any other grandchildren, or seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded in a van parked outside, exploded just after 23:00 on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar when a suicide bomber blew up a backpack loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He fell into a coma the day after the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and he “died” three times while under respiratory assistance.
Hugues said Patek should have known the same fate as the three other members of the Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist cell responsible for the carnage – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed 4 years ago.
In reality, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.
Keep him alive, why, there's no reason to keep him alive.
Spending 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds of others is not much.
Patek is the last of Bali’s bombers to be brought to justice.
He had managed to avoid being captured for nearly 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces will kill former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent said intelligence reports had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in order to restore links between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
“He didn’t surrender,” added Mrs. Corteen.
Until recently, he ridiculed the grief he might have caused to other people.
The verdict was delivered on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks that will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of crying this year,” Corteen said.
Patek, however, can appeal his conviction.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on board aircraft (but not make a call with their mobile phone)
Airline passengers will be able to use their door-to-door electronic devices to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music — but not talk on their mobile phones — under the much-anticipated new directives released by the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday.
But passengers shouldn’t expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be implemented will vary from airline to airline, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta told a news conference.
Airlines will have to prove to the FAA that their aircraft are compliant with the new guidelines and that they have updated crew training manuals and aircraft storage rules to be compliant.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted plans.
“Depending on the plan, we could approve an expanded use of electronic devices very soon,” the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors are closed.
They are not supposed to light them again until the aircraft reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the commander gives his green light.
Passengers are supposed to turn off their aircraft when they descend from the aircraft before landing and not turn it back on until the aircraft has landed.
Under the new directives, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their aircraft during take-offs, landings and ground running, the FAA said.
Most new airliners and other aircraft that have been modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, said she was happy with these changes.
“Once the new policy is implemented safely – and we will work closely with carriers to do so – it will benefit everyone,” Glading said in a statement.
We are frankly tired of feeling like “room supervisors” when it comes to this issue.
But it will still be banned from connecting to the Internet to surf, exchange emails and SMS or upload data below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So still no Words With Friends, the Scrabble-style online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he was loudly ejected from an American Airlines plane after refusing to turn off his device while the device was parked at the door.
And heavier devices like laptops will always have to be stored because they could hurt someone if they flew through the cabin.
Mobile phones on board will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory authority for mobile phones belongs to the Federal Communications Commission and not to the FAA.
FAA may lift ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transportation safety expert on CBS News, said mobile phones were still considered to pose a risk.
“Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could potentially create interference with navigation instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could disrupt mobile relay antennas if used on board,” Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to examine the issue recommended last month that the government authorize a wider use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on the FAA has intensified in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Detractors such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., argue that there is no valid security reason for these prohibitions.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce as the use of devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies indicate that at least one-third of passengers forget to turn off their aircraft, or do so deliberately.
The FAA began limiting the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports of interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers carried FM radios, the high-tech gadget of the time.
New airliners rely much more on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to withstand electronic interference and approved by the FAA.
Airlines have been allowing their passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruise altitudes for several years.
Aircraft modified to accommodate Wi-Fi systems also better withstand interference.
The vast majority of airliners are expected to allow wider use of electronic devices under the new directives, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally emit much lower power radio transmissions than previous generations of devices.
E-book readers, for example, only emit minimal transmissions when a page is turned.
But transmissions are stronger when devices download or send data.
Amazon.com is among those pushing for a loosening of restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, company executives loaded a Kindle e-book reader lineup and flew it to see if there were any problems, but there were none.
This inspired members of the FAA Advisory Committee to have mixed feelings about whether or not the use of the devices poses a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he thought the interference from the aircraft was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the committee said that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots that indicate that the aircraft can interfere with an aircraft's systems, and that most of them are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to ask passengers to turn off their aircraft during instrument landings in low visibility conditions.
A travel industry group welcomed the changes, calling them common sense arrangements for travelers equipped with technology.
“We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with safety,” said Roger Dow, president and director of the U.S. Travel Association.
A helicopter bird from a platform in the North Sea has been released into the wild
A bird, hoisted after being found exhausted on an oil rig in the North Sea, has been released into the wild.
The water jet was brought aboard a helicopter to Aberdeen last month before it was re-established by the Scottish SPCA at its Alloa rescue centre.
The center’s director, Colin Seddon, said: “This trough of water was probably a wintering migrant who came from northern Europe and found himself caught in the midst of violent winds in the North Sea.”
It seems that the exhausted bird has managed to find refuge on the oil platform.
He added: “He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted to help.”
The water trough was in good health when it was released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise of bringing businesses together and defining what wealth and job creators want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
To do this, we commissioned the broadest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders and asked them what they thought of Britain, businesses and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders, globally representing all sizes of businesses, sectors and regions in the UK.
The findings of the survey will come as a surprise to many.
We found that the vast majority of companies are now looking to export outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while EU states are stagnating.
They want the government to prioritize new trade ties with countries like China, India and Brazil rather than slipping into the long and arduous process of reforming European institutional arcanas.
When asked for their views on specific policy issues – from monopolistic regulation to product laws – most business leaders believe that control of these key competencies should be returned to Westminster.
The single market has caused general dissatisfaction, with companies saying that the cost of the Brussels regulation is disproportionate to the benefits of being part of the European trade area – 40% of large companies, traditionally the most pro-European, even agree.
Finally, and more importantly, our survey of business leaders revealed that a large majority wanted Britain to pursue initiatives in favour of a change in the treaty and the development of a relationship with the EU based on trade and not politics.
This finding, which is found in all large groups and companies of all sizes, shows that the business world insists on a “significant change” that restores power to the UK.
The stakes are high – succeeding in changing the treaty and better representing Britain’s interests would see a 16% turnout in favour of keeping the country in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate for a moment: this survey shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain's EU accession.
It also shows that companies hope that the renegotiation will represent a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the hands of the United Kingdom.
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of British businesses, since the euro area is committed to a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be employment and growth in Britain and, as the findings of our survey show, for businesses this means refocusing on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels' regulatory approach.
The United States in the colors of Halloween
In the United States, President Obama has not deviated from the tradition of Halloween.
With his wife last night, he distributed sweets to hundreds of children invited to the White House gardens in Washington.
Last year, Halloween festivities on the east coast of the United States had been canceled due to the passing of Hurricane Sandy.
This year, the party has caught up.
In New York, thousands of costumed people participated in the parade organized in the neighborhood of "Greenwich village".
Everyone is over-excited, says one of the participants, Andrea.

Alexei Miller of Gazprom says Bulgaria’s gas pipeline opens a new era of gas
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, Gazprom's director said.
“A historic event took place today: Construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, Europe’s largest large-scale project,” Alexei Miller, Gazprom’s general manager, said in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of energy security across the European continent.
South Stream is expected to diversify Russia’s export routes to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its counterpart in Ukraine, which transits most of the Russian gas destined for Europe, increases the level of risk compared to conventional routes, the director added.
Miller added that the direct junction to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated "forever".
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced rate as soon as the entire project is put into operation in 2015.
Gazprom said construction is expected to start in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world
The island of Pitcairn wants to create the world's largest marine reserve, Tahiti News reported on Thursday.
This island, east of the Gambier archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory in the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
This territory measures 47 km2, if you count three other small islands nearby.
It has been British since its occupation in 1790 by the Bounty mutinies, an episode in the history of the English Navy that gave rise to three Hollywood adaptations.
A few dozen inhabitants, mostly descendants of Bounty mutinies, still inhabit Pitcairn, and their incomes depend on 95% of London's generosity.
The Council of the Island voted unanimously in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, which corresponds to 836,000 km2 of its exclusive economic zone.
An assistant to the mayor of the island went to London to ask Britain to validate this application.
Mike Warren, the mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the English Governor of Pitcairn, residing in New Zealand, and by the British government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to sanctify these 836,000 km2, provided, however, that it has the means to monitor it, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to surveillance of the area, and there is no port where to place military surveillance ships.
As for France, it already has to carry out the very expensive aerial and maritime surveillance of the five million km2 of the EEZ of French Polynesia, neighboring Pitcairn.
The FAA is loosening restrictions on the use of electronic gadgets on board aircraft – but it will still be banned from making calls on mobile phones.

Life imprisonment for former Chinese vice-governor
A former deputy governor of Jilin province in northeastern China was sentenced to life in prison on Friday for corruption.
Excluded from the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of hitting more than 19 million yuan with bribes, official Chinese media reported.
Between 1995 and 2001, the vice-governor, who was also the president of Jilin Bank, a public institution, helped companies and managers obtain contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, Beijing's first interim court said on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office last March, made the fight against corruption a national priority, believing that the phenomenon posed a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party.
If the head of state promised that justice would be as intractable with the powerful "tigers" as with the "flies" - the junior officials - only a handful of high-ranking officials were convicted, among them former executives of the oil giant Petrochina.
The most spectacular recent case was that of former CCP leader in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after targeting the highest positions within the state.
But the government has not expressed any intention to reform the anti-corruption system by creating, for example, an independent party body.
Two YMCA employees charged with sexual assault following allegations made against Jonathan Lord at a Royal Commission hearing.
Two employees of the New South Wales YMCA were charged with sexual assault against children following allegations made against Caringbah educator Jonathan Lord in 2011 at a hearing of the Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse.
But in its opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA said it “never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within its organization.”
Director-General Phillip Hare was questioned about two cases: an employee of the YMCA was charged with child pornography offences and a physical education monitor at the YMCA Caringbah Hall was found guilty of sexual assault on children at the center where he worked in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, counsel to the Commission, that he was aware of the first case but that he was not aware of the second.
He also admitted that the YMCA’s opening statement was inaccurate, stressing that “external controls by the YMCA have been carried out and have indicated that child safety is an absolute priority for the organization.”
It was demonstrated before the Commission that the YMCA had been informed that it had received the second-worst ratings from four institutions during a Department of Education and Communities quality audit conducted in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who started working at the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that staff management was a failure with Lord's recruitment and that he had failed to verify that employees knew they were required to report any violations of children's safety policy.
Earlier in the year, Lord was convicted of sexual assault on twelve boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of six years in prison.
But Mr. Hare rejected the idea that the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's failings in child safety.
Staff members testified that they had observed certain shortcomings, including the fact that Lord was alone with the children, that he kept them private, made them sit on his knees, told them that he loved them, and let them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was mentored by Lord and had asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior, said she found the YMCA Caringbah Child Services Manager, Jacqui Barnat, to be Lord's mentor "very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time."
The Director-General said that he rejected the staff's testimony that they were reluctant to report these breaches to their hierarchical superior.
Instead, he stated that the friendly relations they had with Lord had blurted their judgment, which meant that they did not report his actions.
Mr. Hare stated that he had expressed his point of view before the New South Wales YMCA board saying that, for the organization, the lesson learned from the "Jonathan Lord incident" should not be about "reporting" by staff, and the board agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to have staff sign confidentiality agreements, shortly after the allegations were raised, was made by the YMCA's Director General for Child Services, Liam Whitley.
He stated that the decision was intended to avoid any contamination of the evidence but that it was an “excess of zeal” and that it had been poorly implemented.
The New South Wales YMCA was not a safe organization for children at the time when Jonathan Lord was employed there, namely between 2009 and 2011, said the expert on sexual violence against children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University before the Commission.
He said there were "serious problems" in recruiting, controlling, initiating, training and supervising staff.
The hearing was adjourned until December 20.
Tony Blair said he would seize the opportunity to become prime minister again, but acknowledged that his return is unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term, the 59-year-old made his views known on various national policies.
Since his departure in June 2007 after a decade at the head of the country, Mr. Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as the Quartet's special envoy for the Middle East peace process.
When asked if he would like to return to the post of Prime Minister, Mr Blair would have replied, according to the London Evening Standard: “Yes, of course, but it may probably happen, so...”
When many equestrian event experts gathered in Cardiff to compete and win the Horse of the Year trophy, they knew the competition would be tough.
But no one expected to see Fenton Kirkland win, a three-year-old.
Not yet at school and only a few months after making his first weapons, the toddler and his Shetland Toffee pony trotted during the three laps with great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind the other 30 adult competitors.
The two inseparables – who are of the same size – were hailed for the presentation, attitude and style at the annual competition that took place at the Sunnybank equestrian centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
Presenting himself against men and women in elegant melon hats, he wore his flat cap a little on the side casually to parade his 2-year-old Toffee pony around the track.
Fenton was praised by the judges for his unusual natural training qualities for a child his age.
And Toffee received very good grades for his presentation and his personality.
Fenton had Toffee as a gift for his 3rd birthday last March and has since trained with his Shetland pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother Donna said, “Fenton and Toffee are a great duo.”
They presented themselves to and against all, but both won the gold cup and the rosette.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffee and we were crazy about the joy that he won.
On the track, people who didn’t know him thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
This young boy from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, in the south of Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been participating in equestrian competitions for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said: “There was electricity in the air and everyone encouraged and applauded it.”
He walked the entire length of the track running and even though he seemed to be quite small, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens he takes care of.
From the way he started, he will surely be participating in the Horse of the Year event soon – and I’m sure he will be doing a great performance.
A spokesman for the annual equestrian event said: “Fenton is only 3 years old but he knows how to drive his pony.”
They make a good team.
The judges noted that Fenton and Toffee presented well and how they paraded on the track.
They are looking for effective teamwork between the pony and the trainer – Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he really looked proud.
A Chinese newspaper that launched a call “will be revamped”
A Chinese newspaper that has launched a front-page call for the release of a journalist accused of defamation will be revamped, a news regulator said.
The Guangzhou-based New Express issued a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to fabricate stories about a semi-public society.
Now, the New Express will undergo a “complete overhaul,” the regulator said.
The order for "recast" comes from the Guangdon administration for Press and Publishing, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, owned by the Yangcheng Evening News group, had published several erroneous articles on the Zoomlion listed company between September 2012 and August 2013.
“New Express’s writing was disorganized,” the regulator said in a statement.
He said he had decided “to impose an administrative sanction on Chen Yongzhou by withdrawing his press card.”
He also “instructed the Yangcheng Evening News Group to undertake a complete overhaul of New Express, and recommended that it conduct an investigation into those responsible at New Express and immediately reassign the newspaper’s management team.”
Chen wrote several articles for the New Express about alleged financial irregularities of a construction equipment manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper twice issued a front-page call for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on a public television channel where he admitted to publishing fake stories for money.
“In this case, I harmed Zoomlion as well as the media industry and its ability to gain public trust,” he told CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was running after money and fame.
I realized my mistake.
Following Chen's apology, New Express posted his apology on the front page, writing that he had not properly checked his articles.
Several prominent suspects have recently made televised confessions.
Experts say people are systematically forced to make their confessions, despite a change to the law that was passed earlier this year prohibiting authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.
The Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier in "unavailability"
In Toulon, the aircraft carrier is in radius.
The radioactive vapour leak detected at one of the two Charles-de-Gaulle nuclear boilers in mid-October and while the ship was at sea, was "safe for sailors", but is not without consequence for the Navy.
The Royale has just confirmed to us the "unavailability" of the ship until "mid-November", "the time to take the necessary corrective measures" on the reactor.
For its part, the company DCNS, a specialist in the naval defense, ensures that its teams and those of Areva, dispatched to the Var for the occasion, "are currently intervening on the aircraft carrier".
It is for them, among other things, to change a pump on the faulty boiler.
"Everything is being done so that Charles-de-Gaulle can make its planned deployment at the end of 2013," DCNS said.
And the National Navy to certify that "it in no way calls into question the program of activity of the ship" nuclear-powered.
Recall that the aircraft carrier Charles-de-Gaulle comes out of an intermediate maintenance period of six months.
He had set off from Toulon in mid-October for training.
This, in particular, in order to qualify young fighter pilots.
A "little breakdown", confined to the confinement space of the reactor, had then occurred on the flagship of the French fleet.
According to the National Navy, the crew had not been exposed to any possible radioactive contamination.
For more than a year, everywhere, I have been able to see a strong dissatisfaction on the part of the people I meet: monstrous revaluation of their properties, a flood of taxes, the cost of permits of all kinds, administrative costs not to be overdone.
In short, unlimited siphoning of our pockets.
Millions of dollars wasted could be saved to allow for a very respectful taxation of those who pay.
Any money forcibly taken from taxpayers diminishes their freedom of consumption and contributes to their impoverishment.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major companies, we do not mind the sumptuous expenses and the maintenance of lazy ducks: deficit cultural center, strong subsidy to the City of Energy, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, sell them to the private company or demolish them.
It is also unfortunate to see the expropriation of several properties in order to accommodate a major industry that has never come.
I do, however, give an honorable mention of the transformation of the old Wabasso into a kind of industrial incubator, but at what cost to taxpayers?
It is not at the public level to invest in such companies, but in the private sector based on consumer demand.
Citizens were pleased to learn that the Fishing and Pile Lakes will continue to supply the city with drinking water.
As a result of the departure of all industries (large water consumers) and the great decline of the population, the use of water has decreased significantly throughout the territory.
Without wasting it, the city will never run out of water and strict regulations on its use could be greatly softened.
In short, it is very easy to do great things with the money of others.
I'd be ashamed to defend such a balance.
With a gross debt of more than $200 million, this city is no longer even able to buy a pen without going through a loan settlement.
We’ve been run for over 40 years by tie-breakers with nice degrees for the most part and I don’t think a sheep farmer is doing worse.
Discovery of a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railroad
One of the most sophisticated tunnels used for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electrical rail systems, has been discovered.
U.S. authorities have described the 4-foot-by-three tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they have ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzag on a length equivalent to nearly six football fields long, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, to San Diego, United States.
The area is full of indefinable warehouses, which makes it easy to hide drug-laden trucks.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs recovered and went unnoticed, authorities said.
Authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the tunnel was discovered, according to court records.
Three men who, according to authorities, worked as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to sell.
They are sentenced to 10 years in prison if they are sentenced to life in prison.
In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers operate vast underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered following the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, posing a challenge to drug cartels who need to quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a 700-yard pass equipped with railroads that started from the kitchen of a Tijuana home and went up to two San Diego warehouses.
British Police Issue Extradition Warrant Against Assange <0xC2><0xB7> Global Voices
British police today issued an extradition warrant against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who took refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and sought political asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had issued a “resignation notice” against the 40-year-old Australian, asking him to report to a police station, adding that if he did not, he would be likely to be arrested.
Assange could be extradited to Sweden following allegations of sex crimes, having exhausted all possible avenues under British law after the Supreme Court invalidated his appeal against his extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would authorize his transfer to the United States, he found refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on June 19, requesting that South American country political asylum.
Scotland Yard has “issued a notice of surrender against a 40-year-old man asking him to appear at a police station, on the date and time of his choice,” a spokesman said.
He continues to violate the conditions of his bail.
The Embassy declined to comment on the release of the notice by the police.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States where he could be charged with espionage, after revealing more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks website fighting secret information.
How Biometrics Will Invade Our Lives
Finished the passwords to type to access your smartphone or pay for your purchases?
American, French or Japanese researchers predict a future where we will be recognized by the biometric sensors of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, deputy general manager of Morpho, even believes that "the century will be biometric".
Only biometrics will ensure the identity of a person carrying out transactions in a world as transversal and transnational as the Internet.
Organizations dedicated to the protection of privacy confirm this enthusiasm for biometrics, but are concerned about it.
Only in 2011 and in France, the National Commission for Information Technology and Freedoms authorized 774 systems for the recognition of fingerprints, the shape of the hand or the venous network of the hand in companies, administrations, canteens...
“Everyone will soon be able to be identified, anywhere and anytime,” said Justin Brookman, head of consumer privacy at the Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, in some, and pessimism, in others?
Biometrics will be based on new techniques, which will provide new services to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most widely used biometric data are fingerprints, the contour of the hand and the venous network of the palm or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its limitations.
“For example, some people who work with concrete have very damaged fingers and their fingerprints are unreadable,” says Philippe Robin, Technical Director of Identity at Thales Communications & Security.
And collecting as well as checking the venous network and the contour of the hand presupposes a voluntary and precise gesture of the people.
It is both a security - we cannot capture this data without their knowledge - and a drawback: sometimes the procedure has to be repeated and therefore takes time.
As a result, research has been conducted for about twenty years on other approaches, such as facial recognition or iris (the colored part of the eye).
By increasing the accuracy of the sensors and the computational capacity of the computers required for data analysis, these techniques become operational.
Face recognition accuracy has increased tenfold over the past five years, says Cyrille Bataller, director of Accenture’s R&D labs in Europe.
With our help, the UK and the Netherlands have deployed automatic border crossings using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a moving face or iris.
“Today, we are conducting research on voice recognition or how to walk using sound sensors, but we need a quiet environment,” said Sridhar Iyengar, director of security research at Intel Labs.
A unique and infallible marker, DNA also arouses hopes and concerns.
“In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered the ultimate biometric data,” confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, CNIL Director of Studies, Innovation and Prospective.
But DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive.
NEC is offering law enforcement a case worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>90,000 to analyze DNA samples at the scene of a crime within an hour.
The uses of biometrics are divided into two groups: identification (recognize a person among others) and authentication (ensure that the person is who they claim to be).
The identification so far concerned the issuance of identity papers: biometric elements (prints, photo, iris) must be compared with the information that the state has on all citizens already registered.
This ensures that a person does not attempt to usurp someone else’s identity.
This principle of comparison may have other applications.
NEC offers VIP recognition at the entrance of a hotel or store.
“We’re retrieving images from surveillance cameras and comparing them to photos of celebrities freely circulating on the Internet,” said Dany Nassif, NEC France’s head of commercial development for biometric identification solutions.
Other use: take a picture of a guy queuing in a store, track his progress thanks to facial recognition and calculate the waiting time.
Authentication initially concerned physical access (borders, protected premises, canteens...) or logical access (opening a computer).
More recently, presence checks have been added.
"A biometric pointer avoids the phenomenon of the friend pointing for another," explains Cyrille Bataller, Accenture.
But, more and more, authentication will also affect transactions, especially those made from devices connected to the Internet.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from some distributors by introducing his card and putting his hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces the key of the secret code.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and Angoul<0xC3><0xAA>me by Natural Security in partnership with banks and retailers: when paying in-store with his bank card, the customer does not enter his code, but inserts his finger into a reader that scans the veins.
The experiment is expected to last six months.
If it is conclusive, biometric readers could soon arrive at French merchants.
Tracks to reassure users
There are three ways to make biometrics appealing to the general public.
The first is to explain that it can save time.
"If, thanks to biometrics, a customer stays in the box for thirty seconds less, it is appreciable," explains the director of a large area.
The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you custom options.
And finally, reassure by highlighting the precautions taken to protect databases.
“Fingerprints are stored on a first server; people’s identities are on a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure case, which crashes if you try to move it,” says Philippe Robin, of Thales.
But, in the absence of in-depth studies, it is impossible to know whether these speeches really convince users.
The specialists in the protection of privacy, they continue to worry.
“The advances in facial recognition, the multiplication of surveillance cameras and the huge amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, make me fear the worst: widespread surveillance,” said Andrew Patrick, Office of the Privacy Commissioner in Canada.
A driver driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink between his legs was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000
A motorist was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink placed in balance between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, of Tiptree in Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 up to Braintree on May 27.
When the police arrested him, they discovered the drink to carry between his legs.
At the Colchester Trial Court, Howie admitted the conduct offence without the required caution and attention.
The seven points removed from his license led to a 6-month license withdrawal.
Howie was also ordered to pay a fee of <0xC2><0xA3>90 and a victim surcharge of <0xC2><0xA3>100.
A tax on foreign real estate owners to blow up the London bubble
The Treasury has provisionally quantified the capital gains tax measure but is awaiting a final decision from Mr. Osborne who, in Budget 2012, entered a 7% stamp duty for properties costing more than <0xC2><0xA3>2m and an annual fee for buyers who choose to own properties as part of a corporation.
The stamp duty already applies to the residential properties of the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea boroughs, and represents <0xC2><0xA3>708 million in fiscal year 2012/13, which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the Northeast, the North West and the United Yorkshire region.
Cook said: "Following the increase in the stamp duty on high value properties and the introduction of the anti-avoidance law on high value properties, it is very difficult to argue that high value properties are undertaxed regardless of the effects of the outdated housing tax system."
“But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy properties in London or current owners reluctant to sell,” he added.
Prestigious real estate – the 5-10% of the highest real estate market prices – in the thriving south-west London sector stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, rose by a record 11.8% over the past year.
Prices in central London show steady year-over-year growth of 5.6% but have been overshadowed by a fast-growing "domestic market", with the city's southwest, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) recovering, according to Savills studies.
Scientists have just shed light on how a dog’s tail movements are linked to his mood.
Previous studies had revealed that happy dogs moved their tail more to the right (from the dog’s point of view), while nervous dogs moved it more to the left.
But now scientists say dogs can detect these subtle differences and respond to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: “Everyone knows that in humans, the left and right sides of the brain are involved differently in stimuli that awaken positive or negative emotions.”
Here, we tried to see what it was like in other species.
He added that just as in humans, in dogs, the right side of the brain was responsible for the movement to the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to other dogs’ disordered tail movements, the researchers followed animals watching movies featuring other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the animals and analyzed their behavior.
It probably won’t be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes on one side and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: “We presented dogs with films featuring other dogs – either a naturalistic version or a silhouette to avoid any other factor of confusion – and we were able to traffic the movement of the tail and present it as going more to the left or to the right.”
When the animals saw an expressionless dog wagging the tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog wagging the tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they spotted a tail diverting mainly to the left (again from the point of view of the dog waving the tail), their heart rate accelerated and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think that dogs deliberately communicated with each other through these movements.
Instead, he thinks that dogs know from experience what movements they should or should not worry about.
He added: “If you encounter other dogs several times and if you notice that, most of the time, the movement of their tail to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the right side results in a less friendly attitude, you will react based on that experience.”
The researchers indicate that the results could allow owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals.
Dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, a visiting professor at the University of Bristol's School of Veterinary Sciences, said this was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and right in the canine species.
Last year, a team at Lincoln University discovered that dogs turned their heads to the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and to the right when it was a happy dog.
And in another scientific study conducted by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: “Dogs went more easily to a robot dog when its tail was moving to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming anxious – the opposite of what appears in the Italian study.”
He indicated that the differences could come from the fact that the dogs that participated in the different studies did not fully consider the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study on how dogs react to real dogs could be helpful, he explained.
“Although many elements, found in different mammals, indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified – and dogs are no exception,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviors can be recorded, it probably won’t be long before we understand why their tails sometimes move on one side and sometimes on the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpones concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner’s illness
The rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed a concert in Glasgow after their singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
Sheffield's band was due to perform at The Hydro concert hall in downtown Sheffield on Friday.
However, his laryngitis forced singer Alex Turner to reschedule the show.
The announcement was made after the band was forced to postpone a concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: “Following the decision to postpone the concert to the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and after requesting medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys are also expected to postpone the show to the Glasgow Hydro on Friday, November 1.
Alex Turner suffers from laryngitis and regrets not being able to perform in concert.
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on 20 November and the one at the Hydro in Glasgow will be held on 21 November.
All tickets remain valid for these concerts.
We would like to apologise to all ticket holders for any inconvenience caused.

Pope Francis will appoint his first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals from the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, the Vatican said on Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest placed churchmen in the Catholic Church behind the pope, and those who elect him, so Francis will name his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, as soon as a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope – this is the responsibility of a group of 120 “electoral cardinals”.
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said a meeting gathering all existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony during which bishops would be raised to the dignity of a cardinal, known as a consistory.
“Pope Francis has decided to communicate his decision to convene the February Consistory in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of the Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinals likely to have decreased.
He said a pope generally appointed as many cardinals as needed for the number of cardinals to reach 120 and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wanted.
Next year’s consistory will be important because it will be the first since Pope Francis’ election in March this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a kind of tendency to favour Europe and in particular Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he added.
40% of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
The cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with examining ways to reform the church.
In the past, the pope decided on his own.
“Now, Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He added that it was “quite possible” for Francis to seek advice from the cardinals.
But we have never experienced such a situation – it is completely new.
Valero said the popes generally raised bishops representing large communities to the rank of cardinal, but that Francis was “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he will name.”
GM recalls some of its new pickups in the U.S. to repair the seat back
General Motors Co recalls nearly 19,000 of its all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups to fix a problem with manually tilting files, according to a statement Friday from the U.S. body in charge of vehicle safety regulation.
On some pickups, the front seats could have a defect in the tilt mechanism.
As a result, the files do not meet federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
“If the vehicle is hit from the rear, the head restraint may not properly protect passengers, thus increasing the risk of injury,” according to the statement posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The recalled models were built between August 1 and September 10.
The deployment of GM pickups began in June and represents the largest vehicle launch for the first U.S. automaker since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed pickup owners of the defect during the first half of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the landlords' newsletter due to the 16-day cessation of government activities, which slowed growth in vehicle sales in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra pickups, which have been redesigned for the 2014 model, increased by about 20 percent in the first 10 months of the year, GM said Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM’s stock price rose 1.4% to $37.47 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon.
A worker dies buried under concrete blocks.
A construction worker died buried under dozens of concrete blocks on Thursday morning in Montreal.
The tragedy occurred around 11 a.m., on Marquette Street, near the intersection of Beaubien Street, in the Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie district.
It is probable that work on the foundations has been taking place here for some time.
A Mitoyan foundation wall had just been erected in the last few days.
The accident occurred when the victim had just arrived at the site to retrieve his tools.
I was passing by by car and I saw the wall collapse with a big cloud of smoke, said Sylvain Jean, who is staying close to the construction site.
I landed and went to remove the big bricks that covered it.
We only saw part of his back, it's so unfortunate.
According to authorities, the victim is a man in his fifties who worked for a formwork company.
Resuscitation manoeuvres were attempted by the emergency services, but were unsuccessful.
The man did not survive his serious injuries.
An inspector of the Commission on Health and Safety at Work was dispatched on the spot to investigate the circumstances surrounding this tragedy.
The Cry of Despair of an Obama Voter
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of change.
He says Obama has made laudable efforts thwarted by Republican obstructionism
Obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of the Obamacare site, nor the drone attacks
The memory of Obama’s 2008 campaign is a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a 2nd year medical student at Harvard Medical School.
I am reading a very sad book these days.
It is a book that, I thought, would encourage me during the morbidity of the 2nd year of medicine and give me hope again.
It's called "The Audacity to Win" and it's the memoirs of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finished my patients’ medical records in the evening and went to bed, this book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and speeches could take your breath away.
The election ended in a crushing victory and newscasters took the time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment.
My comrades wept with joy and my parents kept all the newspapers they found.
A young team of visionaries was advancing toward the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During Obama's transition period before taking office in 2008, he had 82 per cent of favorable opinions.
And then I close the book.
Returning to the present is a difficult awakening, it is like coming out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these days full of optimism, they are like distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change really happened in the years that followed the first time I voted.
It had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
I am crediting Obama with great achievements, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to the departure of Iraq from our army, to the end of the “neither seen nor known” and the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
In addition, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in the area of immigration reforms, public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after repeatedly defending the Obama administration against my peers and colleagues, I can no longer provide explanations.
I am on the verge of political despair.
The Republican obstruction cannot explain the wiretapping of foreign leaders or the drone attacks on innocent foreign children.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on Americans’ privacy, or the indictment of whistleblowers who reveal the government’s misdeeds.
It cannot justify the murder of Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, without trial, or the evasion of public funding and the overrun of the spending allowed during the presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the findings of a report that says the White House’s efforts to silence the media are “the most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration.”
And, more recently, it cannot excuse the impossibility of designing a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act was ratified.
I don't know if that's what I was expecting.
If, at the age of 18, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it.
Obviously, the electoral function is not predictable, because the opposition political party and the events that happen by chance, such as the Newton massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all the examples I have listed above seem to be largely the choice of administration.
That's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and unrefined alternative that did not seem to allow his policies or positions to be determined.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second term by being freed from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises that had been heard for so long.
Yet while the favorable opinion index plunged below 45% this week, it is even more difficult to return to the year 2008 through this book.
It makes me wish for the many promises that have flown.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered huge losses in favor of Clinton at the Pennsylvania Primary.
At a post-campaign meeting, he told his team that they needed to get back on track and stay true to their cause.
“I want us to focus on our talent,” he said.
We need to remember who we are.
We are five years later, Mr. President, and I no longer agree with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.
On Friday, around 3 p.m., a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car occurred on rue de Retinne in Fléron.
The biker, Jonathan, 26, from Fléron, was not wearing a helmet.
Despite the rapid intervention of the rescue, he died in this frontal collision.
Clive Palmer claims that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer argues that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and enjoy the system.
The mining tycoon, who disputes the payment of a carbon tax of $6 million, has made this argument to try to rule out issues regarding a possible conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be abolished.
But Mr. Palmer argued that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr. Abbott's daughters were willing to personally benefit from these policies.
“There will be a major conflict of interest when it comes to paying parental leave because if one of her daughters is pregnant, she will have a direct interest in whether or not she gets leave,” Palmer said.
Two months after his election, the Electoral Commission officially declared that Mr. Palmer won the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax by 53 votes, after recounting.
Mr. Palmer advanced the idea of a redesign of the voting system to speed up the process.
The daughters of Tony Abbott, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is over?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why couldn’t we have a system where you can enter, enter your contact details in a computer, vote immediately and have the result at 6:30 the next morning?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of paper pencils to mark ballots.
Is it to be able to erase the result if someone disagrees?
Nowadays, having a paper pencil seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission has examined possible options for electronic voting and recently published a joint reflection paper with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new functions “very seriously.”
The exercise of public functions is a matter of public service.
“We’re not looking for a reward, except for the reward of history because we have to serve the community at a critical time,” he added.
A team of biologists led by the New York Wildlife Conservation Society has identified a new species of humpback dolphin off the northern coast of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, scientific mission manager at the Observatory for the Conservation and Study of Marine Animals and Environments (OCEAMM), returns to L'Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Does the discovery of this new species of humpback dolphin surprise you?
That's good news, but I'm not particularly surprised.
While species have in the past been described and identified on a morphological, anatomical and geographical basis, today the development of new tools such as genetics allows us to improve our knowledge in the sciences of species classification.
Moreover, it is not impossible that these advances in genetics and molecular biology call into question the classification or membership of a species in a genus, a family, or even an order.
In the early 19th century, morphologists classified animals based on morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these rankings are challenged due to advances in genetics.
In the same way, two species very close morphologically have been distinguished thanks to genetics.
This is the case with the new species that has just been identified.
About a decade ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: the Pacific humpback dolphins and the Atlantic humpback whales.
Recent analyses have made it possible to distinguish four species.
Why is this an important discovery as claimed by the Wildlife Conservation Society?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences, in order to protect the species and therefore its genetic variability.
If this population was already known to researchers for a long time, they did not know that it was part of a new species, present only in this place.
Therefore, if a massive mortality problem caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture occurs in the region, we could be dealing with the extinction of a species, rather than a local extinction of a population of a species more widespread on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered endangered or endangered based on the number of individuals on Earth, that is, the stock, and the possibility that it has to recover from neighboring stocks.
As for the species Sousa chinensis, whose population of the newly discovered species has emerged, its stock has automatically become weaker, thus making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats, in which there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This blending of genes limits the creation of new species.
Conversely, more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can eventually lead to the creation of new species.
The marine environment is the least well known environment.
We prefer to send robots to Mars, than to know what lives in the pit of the Marianas, only 11 kilometers from the surface of the sea.
We spend more money on the search for life on other planets than we do on marine research, and it’s high time that that changed.
RBS suspends two traders in the foreign exchange market
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange market division, according to two sources close to the file, which shows once again that the regulators’ global investigation into suspicions of currency market manipulation is beginning to bear fruit.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators as part of investigations into the world’s largest financial market, where $5.3 trillion change hands every day.
The two traders are the first RBS employees to be suspended as part of the widening investigation that echoes the Libor interbank rate manipulation scandal.
The bank, which declined to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it has received requests for information from regulators.
“The ongoing investigation into this case continues and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators,” a bank representative said two weeks ago.
Last month, sources close to the file said RBS had sent files of emails and instant messages, sent to and from a former trader, to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and was reportedly suspended from his position as European head of currency trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European head of foreign exchange trading at Citi, was on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior foreign exchange trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been the subject of any charges.
Usher’s file included instant messages sent to and by bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, sources close to the file added.
UBS said this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating suspicions of currency market manipulation in a number of Swiss banks.
In the world, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are examining allegations made about bankers who have agreed to manipulate rates on the foreign exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, sources close to the file said.
Banks peel instant messages and emails sent for years to find cases of reprehensible acts.
The news regarding these surveys has shaken traders in a sector that has been one of the biggest drivers of growth in investment banks’ trading units in recent years, but which has been challenged this year due to the low currency volatility that limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the matter by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast highly liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader said that despite the high volume of daily foreign exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between exchange management platforms and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms “explains that it is possible to start having an impact on the market at a low cost.”
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced it had sent a trader working in its London Stock Exchange office this week after it caused a $6 million loss at the end of last year.
The bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with the regulators.
“We are convinced that the trader acted alone and that the case was mastered,” said a representative of Credit Suisse.
The investigation of Mayor Rob Ford has been flouted, says a lawyer
After police confirmed that they had seized a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking crack, Mr. Clayton Ruby claimed he had never seen an investigation "as sloppy".
Mr Ruby said he believed in The Canadian Press that the police had "ignored or minimized" the evidence against the mayor.
On Thursday, police arrested Rob Ford's friend and occasional driver, Alexander Lisi, 35, and charged him with extortion in connection with the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
Police said they also observed the man delivering packages to Rob Ford, according to new court documents.
Mr. Ruby called it "inexplicable" that the police never searched Rob Ford's vehicle or his home, or tapped his phone, arguing that Chief of Police Bill Blair knowingly chose not to act against the mayor.
Under the law, the police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands, could very well have intercepted Rob Ford's vehicle, arrested the mayor, and carried out a search - even without a warrant.
It could also have requested an instant search warrant, if deemed necessary.
The chief of police did not comment, but his spokesman Mark Pugash called Ruby's remarks an "obvious and desperate attempt" to make a claim to the media in a case that does not concern him at all.
At a press conference on Thursday, Blair said there was nothing in the video that could constitute "reasonable grounds" that could lead to the filing of criminal charges against the mayor.
European Stock Exchanges Down at Mid-Session, Except London
With the exception of London, major European stock exchanges are moving down Friday at mid-session, led by some news of disappointing companies, while Wall-Street is expected to go up.
At the same time, investors remain cautious as they believe the U.S. Federal Reserve could unwind its quantitative easing policy sooner than expected.
Conversely, after the announcement of an inflation rate of 0.7% for the euro area as a whole, the idea is spreading among market players that the European Central Bank (ECB) could ease its monetary policy.
Wall Street’s futures suggest an upward opening of U.S. stocks, after two consecutive downsizing sessions.
At values, Renault (-4.63%) recorded the strongest decline of the CAC 40, led by the result warning of its partner Nissan Motor on Friday.
The Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) marked the worst performance of the EuroFirst300, after also publishing declining results this morning and announcing the in-house creation of a defamation structure ("bad bank") comprising 38 billion pounds of the most risky assets.
For its part, Vodafone (+2.45%) remains at the forefront of EuroFirst300 increases in response to press reports that AT&T is considering a possible OPA.
In the foreign exchange market, speculation about the evolution of the ECB’s monetary policy is going well, as shown by John Hardy, strategist at Saxo Bank.
The ECB’s single mandate has always focused on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reason to take action at next week’s meeting.
We anticipate a strong potential for a downward trend in the euro.
In this context, the euro continues its decline against the US currency and hit a two-week low at $1.3517 in the session.
These same conjectures, on the contrary, support the euro area bond market.
Supreme Court approves Obama's health care reform bill
Big victory for the Obama administration: The U.S. Supreme Court today declared that the health care reform law ratified by Obama was constitutional.
By 5 votes to 4, the judges validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which requires citizens to take out health insurance by 2014, or pay a fine – and declared it to be constitutional under the government’s tax power.
The president of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined the four most liberal members of the Court, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy disagreed.
The Court also validated the other sections of the 2,700-page law and found that the provision of the Health System Reform Act, which stipulates that the Medicaid eligibility threshold must be lowered at the risk of losing all federal funding for the program, was coercive in accordance with the Constitution.
The process to block the law was initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All major Republican candidates in the presidential election in the 2012 primaries, including nominee Mitt Romney, were fiercely opposed to the law.
Vivid tribute to veterans in Menton
In the heart of the Trabuquet cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic associations, paid tribute to the soldiers and the dead of all wars this Friday afternoon.
Gerbs were deposited in two of the three military squares of the cemetery by Deputy Mayor Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Israeli-Palestinian border crossing in Gaza
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers wounded on Thursday, October 31, 2013, in the evening of a violent hanging on the Gaza-Israeli border, the most serious incident in Palestinian territory in a year.
The Gaza Strip’s only power plant ceased operation on Friday, November 1, after its fuel stocks were exhausted, the Palestinian Enclave’s Energy Authority said.
A local commander of the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another member of the Hamas armed branch, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed in a tank shelling raid by the Israeli army east of Khan Younes in the southern Gaza Strip.
Two other local Al-Qassam brigade officials, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, were killed when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same area.
Their bodies were later discovered.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four fighters were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
An attack on a tunnel dug by Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli tank and an armored bulldozer made an incursion of about one hundred meters into the territory before retreating later.
The confrontation lasted for half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a statement, Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zouhri paid tribute to the four "heroes" and said Israeli soldiers had been killed in the confrontation.
Hamas congratulates the heroes of Al-Qassam who fell while defending the territory during an incursion of the Zionist occupier in Khan Younes.
Several enemies were killed and wounded during the operation.
"Hamas assures that Gaza will be a hell for the occupier," the spokesman said.
For its part, the Israeli army indicated that the target of its operation was initially a section of a large tunnel dug into Israeli territory from the Palestinian enclave, discovered on October 7 and intended, according to the army, for "terrorist activities".
Hamas claimed the use of tunnels to fight Israel, saying the goal was to remove Israeli soldiers to exchange them for Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, an Israeli military statement said.
During the operation, Hamas fired an explosive device targeting IDF (Israeli army) forces and wounded 5 soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
"This mission was imperative because of the risk of using the terrorist tunnel for attacks on Israeli civilians," Army spokesman Peter Lerner said.
In addition, Israel struck an air base in northwestern Syria, targeting a cargo of missiles destined for the Lebanese Shiite movement Hezbollah, the Al-Arabiya satellite channel reported on Thursday.
A U.S. official confirmed an "Israeli strike" but gave no details about the target.
“In the past, the targets were missiles transferred to Hezbollah,” he added.
Israeli government officials have refused to confirm any information regarding such an attack.
Citing “exclusive sources” that it did not name, the Saudi-owned chain said that “the bombing targeted a cargo of surface-to-air missiles that was destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon,” referring to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement fighting the rebels alongside Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, had reported several explosions heard Wednesday at dawn at an air defense base in Sonar Jablé, near Latakia, on the Syrian coast.
This organization, based on a network of activists and medical sources, had not been able to identify the origin of the explosions.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents at Danse Danse her two new group choreographies: the first inspired by the inks and poems of Henri Michaux, the second inspired by the famous piano solos Gymnopédies de Satie.
An evening that allows you to see all the prism of Chouinard, from art to tics and from black ink to white.
A white screen serves as a background wall.
On the carpet, also white, in the immense space that is the Maisonneuve Theatre, advances, profile, fine as a line and dressed in black, a body.
On the screen, an ink of Henri Michaux is projected.
The body, simple trait, takes its form.
And this shape will be that of the whole room: a string of physical imitations of the drawings.
The dancers, fully dressed in black, only hands and face uncovered, wait on either side of the playing area, rush when the next graphic appears, embody it, emerge running.
This black and white game by Henri Michaux is done in solo relays, in a unison group (a mass that makes solo), in a large group of twelve solos where each performs its own sign.
One thinks of "Glory of the Morning", where, solo, Chouinard performed a series of choreographic tasks written on posters, posed online at the front stage.
It's the same principle, giant PowerPoint version.
Here, the music is loud, percussion and electric guitars.
The energy is high, the pace is always fast.
There will be a break when Carol Prieur will take refuge under the dance mat, to deliver, microphone in hand, without sobriety or restraint, a part of Michaux's poem, monochord and monotone in the shout, and will continue dancing.
And the music to go back, and the sequence to resume.
This sonic and energetic discharge, long, if possible, ends up deafening and numbing.
As does the regularity of the visual rhythm.
There are a few beautiful flashes - image creation has always been a strength at Chouinard - like those hairs that are flaking or those black fabrics that elongate the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
One has the impression that the choreographer, instead of going to meet the work of Michaux, has imposed herself, with her tics.
As a result, the bodies appear flat in front of the drawings.
Michaux’s inks, like Gestalt forms, open up a broader, more porous imagination than dance.
Only the end, in the negative, with its dancers chopped by a strobe light and the white signs in a suddenly black theater, touches magic.
The public loved it, the welcome was warm.
Gymnopedia, after intercourse, is richer.
The stage is partly draped in grey, the dancers and a piano are covered in fabrics, like furniture in a neglected house.
At the piano, dancers relay to play the scores.
Their unaddressed music, touching, give a real fragility.
On stage, couples, in duos in love, very sensual, even erotic.
Group work, small solos of transitions, moving ensembles, choirs, writing is less binary.
Buffons appear, also familiar to Chouinard, with a red nose, in very polarized male-female love parades.
Loves are carnal, fugitive, or player.
Gestures, laughter and small cries beautifully transpose the archaic, grace and ridicule of coitus bodies, of beings that merge.
But the play takes its real flight after salvation.
A clown returns to the stage when the audience leaves.
There, everything is allowed: the fourth wall falls, the explored universes overlap, the dancers cabotage, descend among the spectators, gloss, smoke, short-circuit, play codes of applause, stretch the sauce in a wisely calculated disorder that remains sensual.
Joy and madness pervade, and it is Chouinard’s art here to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei sue for Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, has launched an avalanche of patent lawsuits Thursday against mobile phone makers, including Google, the company it slapped at the stake during the patent auction that took place after Nortel’s bankruptcy.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, filed a lawsuit against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in the U.S. Court of Appeals in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
Patents contain technologies that allow advertising related to Internet search terms to be displayed, the findings of the trial said, which is at the heart of Google’s business.
It was not possible to reach representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture phones that run under Google’s Android operating system, which delivers fierce competition to Apple and Microsoft’s mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial offer of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google has increased its offering several times, eventually offering $4.4 billion.
After losing Nortel patents to Rockstar, Google subsequently acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a market in part based on Motorola’s patent library.
“While Google has failed in its attempt to acquire the patents in question during the auction, it has violated and continues to violate those patents,” the court said in a statement.
Rockstar claims greater damages against Google because it claims that Google’s patent infringement is stubborn, according to the complainant.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: a faulty water heater that caused the explosion
Grandma allegedly lit a cigarette during a gas leak.
The explosion of a home in Gesves, which left two seriously injured on Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson, is due to a gas leak from a faulty water heater, the King's deputy prosecutor said on Friday night.
The expert dispatched on the spot by the prosecutor's office ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother lit a cigarette while there was a leak and a gas buildup.
The vital prognosis of the two victims is still engaged.
The grandmother was projected by the explosion and is severely burned.
The little boy, who was staying with his grandfather and his companion, was by his side and was burned more lightly.
"The two victims were intubated and long conditioned on the spot before being taken to the CHU of Li<0xC3><0xA8>ge, she in a helicopter, he in an ambulance," said the mayor José Paulet, who went down on the spot.
Traumatized, Grandpa was upstairs at the time of the explosion.
Safe and secure, he was able to reach the ground floor by the staircase remained intact while the back wall of the house was totally destroyed.
The grandfather and tenant of the neighboring house, which was weakened by the explosion, were relocated by the OHCHR President.
The firefighters of Andenne and Namur and the police of the Arches intervened.
The civil protection of Crisnée has stabilized both buildings.
Egypt calls on first freely elected president to take oath
Mohamed Morsi has taken the oath of inauguration, but it is unlikely that his day of triumph will mark the end of political conflicts in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a “new Egypt” when he took the oath of office, becoming the first freely elected president and succeeding Hosni Mubarak who was ousted 16 months earlier.
During his inauguration before the High Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and the fifth head of state of Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He was sworn in before the 18 black-robed judges of the Court whose building on the banks of the Nile was built to resemble an Egyptian temple.
“We aspire to better tomorrows, a new Egypt and a second republic,” President Morsi said during the solemn ceremony broadcast live on public television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Mr. Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer trained in the United States, from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years since its formation as an illegal and hard-line organization.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11:00 local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered before the Court to cheer for the new president, and as they stood out from the Mubarak-era presidential guise, traffic was only briefly interrupted to allow his convoy to pass through the busy streets connecting the city center to the southern suburbs.
Considered the uncharismatic “relief wheel” of the Muslim Brotherhood, his personal prestige has been greatly strengthened since his victory and Friday speech during which he tried to present himself as the candidate not only of the Islamists but of all those who want to finish the work begun during the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mobaruk president.
“Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” said Mohamed Morsi, wearing a blue suit and a red tie, addressing the judges in the woodwork room where he was sworn in.
Later, Mr. Morsi went to the University of Cairo where he delivered his inaugural address.
He was officially greeted by a military fanfare that played the national anthem while he was on guard.
Marshal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by the song “The people and the army, hand in hand...” sung by thousands of people gathered in the university’s grand amphitheatre.
Founded in 1908 and a former bastion of secular education, the University of Cairo later became a fief of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday on Tahrir Square, from where the uprising that ended Mubarak's authoritarian regime last year began, and vowed to regain the presidential powers that the military council, which replaced the ex-president, ousted him.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before the Court, rather than before Parliament as is customary, he bows to the will of the army by showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Mr. Morsi’s speech on Tahrir Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
The shutdown in the US slowed the rise of the automotive market
The 16-day shutdown by most federal governments weighed on U.S. car sales growth in October, according to figures released Friday by manufacturers, five of the top six having achieved performances below expectations.
The three major Detroit manufacturers are seeing double-digit growth compared to October 2012, but only General Motors did better than expected.
Analysts expected an average of 15.4 million annualized and seasonally adjusted sales, but the market stood at 15.3 million, according to estimates from Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas.
In a note to the bank’s customers, he believes that this slight slowdown is primarily explained by “the government’s ‘shutdown’ and its impact on consumer sentiment during the first fortnight of the month.”
GM, however, reported a nearly 16% increase in sales last month to 226,402 vehicles, compared to 211,563 expected by consensus.
The group’s four brands saw their business performance improve compared to October 2012.
Ford, which continues to benefit from the success of its pick-ups, saw sales grow by 14% year-on-year to 191,985 vehicles, while the consensus was expected to be 194,301.
For its part, Fiat-controlled Chrysler announced an 11% increase in its sales to 140,083 vehicles, up from 143,536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also posted lower-than-consensus sales, despite year-on-year increases of 8.8% and 14.2% respectively.
On the New York Stock Exchange, GM stock gained 1.4% at 16:35 GMT while Ford sold 1.1%.
Renault Plumbed on the Stock Exchange by Nissan's Warning
Renault on Friday blamed the sharpest decline in the SBF 120 index in Paris after its partner Nissan Motor announced it had lowered its annual net profit forecast by nearly 20 percent, traders report.
Nissan, which had to carry out such a review, also announced a reshuffle of its management.
Several traders reported that Renault's stock was affected this morning by the "warning".
"This is clearly Nissan's profit warning," said a Parisian broker trading official.
As part of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault holds 43.4% of Nissan's capital and the Japanese manufacturer 15% of the French, according to data from Nissan's website.
Greece: Two killed in a shooting near a neo-Nazi party building
Two people were killed and another was seriously injured on Friday night by gunshots fired by two people who were on a motorcycle passing in front of a neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party venue in the western suburb of Athens, a police source said.
The police were not yet able to provide information on the identity of the victims and their possible political affiliation.
Some Greek media reported that members of Golden Dawn had argued that the victims were guards of their premises.
The injured person was immediately hospitalized, according to the same source.
Anti-terrorism police rushed to the central avenue in the Neo Iraklio suburb, where the incident took place, and closed the neighborhood.
The incident comes a few weeks after six Golden Dawn MPs, including the leader and founder of the party, were charged with participating in a "criminal organization" as part of an offensive against the party launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.
Scott Brown's appeal rejected
Scott Brown, the captain of Celtic Glasgow, has seen his appeal rejected and will be well suspended for the next two Champions League matches of his club, against Ajax and AC Milan.
Expulsed against Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a for hitting Neymar, the Scottish club saw its suspension extended to three matches by UEFA.
In a statement, his club said it was "very disappointed", believing his call was fully justified.
Nearly 50,000 homes are deprived of electricity across the province shortly after noon on Friday, due to strong winds hitting many areas along the St. Lawrence River.
The sectors most affected are the Laurentians with 15,042 subscribers immersed in the dark, the Montérégie with 13,464 and the Outaouais with 8642.
The greater Montreal region is also experiencing a lot of breakdowns with nearly 7,000 homes deprived of electricity in the metropolis and in Laval.
Did you think travel agencies belonged to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to reverse the trend.
The company has revised its net profit forecasts upwards and expects record results from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel agency is now expected to make an underlying profit over the entire year between $325 million and $340 million before tax, compared to a previous forecast of $305 million to $315 million.
If current forecasts are met, this will represent 12% to 17% growth from the record profit of $290.4 million achieved in 2011/12.
Director-General Graham Turner said Flight Centre had made 8% profit in the first half and that the second half had started strongly, particularly with regard to non-business travel to Australia and the UK.
“Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present are profitable, and many of them are on track to achieve record results for the entire fiscal year before deducting interest and taxes,” he said.
This concerns Australia and the United Kingdom, which are generally the countries that generate the largest profits.
In Australia, the leisure travel sector bounced back in the second half, compensating for a slightly declining domestic business travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre’s leisure travel sector performed well, while business customers spent less.
Its U.S. subsidiary recovered its losses in the first half of the year when seasonal demand was lower and was expected to make a profit on the entire fiscal year for the third time in a row.
The shares of Flight Centre increased by 3 cents to reach $38.20 yesterday.
Unknown gunman shoots hotel near Cairo's pyramids
Unidentified gunmen opened fire on Friday on a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo in Egypt without causing any casualties as a result of an apparent feud with laid-off employees.
The assailants fled, Interior Ministry spokesman General Abdel Latif said.
The attack comes as Egypt receives almost no tourists since the army ousted Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in early July and represses in blood the demonstrations of his supporters.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on math, spelling, and grammar
As part of English literature courses, students will be required to study at least one play of Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, a romantic poem, and a work of contemporary British fiction from 1914 to the present day.
The review will also introduce “new texts” to encourage more diverse reading.
A course combining English literature and language will be deleted.
Starting in 2015, students will be required to pass an independent language GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education is due to publish its new English and Maths programs tomorrow – the first subjects to undergo a radical revision.
It will make changes in other key areas next year.
In addition, Ofqual, the Examination Regulatory Office, will unveil a redesign of the structure of the GCSEs, with a new rating system and fewer courses.
Speaking during the summer, Michael Gove, Minister of Education, said there was “a broad consensus on the need to reform our review system to restore public confidence,” emphasizing that GCSEs would be “more stimulating, more ambitious and more rigorous.”
Studies show that English schools devote less time to math (116 hours per year, or 3 hours per week during the school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours per year, and Singaporean students offer about 138 hours per year.
While there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of time to math, sources close to the coalition government have indicated that the GCSE of in-depth maths – as well as the greater importance given to subjects in the international rankings – would likely encourage schools to provide more hours.
The program will focus more on "real-world problems," including financial mathematics.
This ruling means that a bill passed in July in that state that largely calls into question the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
An octogenarian welcomes children with a rifle in the Muy for Halloween
The 9- and 13-year-olds would go door-to-door to claim candy on Halloween night.
One of the residents of the Muy neighborhood visited by the children opened the door holding his hunting rifle.
The 86-year-old told the gendarmes that he was afraid.
His weapon was seized.
Former Gestapo Chief Buried in Jewish Cemetery
Müller, who disappeared at the end of World War II without being traced, was actually buried in a mass grave in a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the head of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
Müller did not survive the end of the war.
"His body was buried in 1945 in a mass grave in the Jewish cemetery of Berlin-Mitte," he said in a daily press release based on archival documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of Adolf Hitler’s Nazi regime, would answer one of the great puzzles of the post-war period.
The German secret services, the BND, thus ensured that during the summer of 1949, Müller was in Karlovy Vary, then Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
The Secret Service was completely wrong.
"As early as August 1945, Müller's body was found in a provisional tomb near the former Reich Aviation Ministry by a commando," according to Mr. Tuchel.
He was wearing a “general’s uniform.”
“In the inner left pocket were, among other things, his service statuses with a photo,” he continues.
Bild also publishes a document from the district council of the Mitte district in Berlin indicating that he was buried in the Jewish cemetery of the district.
The president of the Central Council of German Jews, Dieter Graumann, said he was shocked by the revelation.
The fact that one of the most brutal Nazi sadists is buried in a Jewish cemetery is a huge amount of bad taste.
"The memory of the victims is grossly crowded," he said in the newspaper.
Heinrich Müller is one of the important figures of the Third Reich who were never captured.
He participated in the Wannsee conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final solution" and under his orders Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistics" of the extermination of Jews, was sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

It walks in the mud, jungle and crosses rivers to offer free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in villages in Cameroon
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this West African country, barely 1 per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or on your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN Heroes of the Year 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the other 10 heroes, to elect him “CNN Hero of the Year”.
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father alternate periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and go to hospitals that were not equipped to come to his aid.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he only had one broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that he would carry with him for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him abroad if we had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in crowded clinics and hospitals to get him any treatment he could benefit from.
“It’s not easy,” adds Mr. Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5:00, rush to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation has not changed much since the death of Dr. Bwelle's father in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only 1 doctor per 5,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.
In comparison, the ratio in the United States is 1 doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians could not afford the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three quarters of the country’s health spending is done in the private sector.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” Dr. Bwelle explained.
And because of poverty, they can’t enjoy life.
After seeing his father and so many of his compatriots suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers practiced more than 700 surgical procedures for free over the past year.
He became a physician himself, working as a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
And he created a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, with about thirty people, they pile up in vans after fixing medical equipment on the roof and traverse difficult terrain to get to the villages that need help the most.
Luck doesn’t always follow them.
They often had to push vehicles to cross rivers or muddy tracks.
But when they arrive, they are welcomed as heroes: the community organizes a party, sings and dances and offers them the best accommodations available.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr. Bwelle – with his big smile and overflowing energy – is more than happy to join the festivities.
The next morning, the team begins to receive hundreds of patients.
“We receive 500 people on each visit,” said Mr. Bwelle.
They sometimes live 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
In this itinerant hospital, various health care is provided.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive crutches, a collected pair of glasses, or a free birth certificate – a document required to go to school, but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgical acts under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually performed in a school, town hall or home; after the intervention, the patient gets up and goes to the wake room to leave his place for the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the generator set, the operating room and the sterilization of the equipment, Dr. Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday morning.
It’s a grueling rhythm, but village musicians generally help the team stay motivated.
“They’re beating drums all night to keep us awake so we can continue to work,” Bwelle said.
On Sunday, the team returns to the city, tired but proud of the work it has done.
The group, made up of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, practiced 700 surgical acts for free over the past year, and it knows that their presence can make all the difference for those they come to help.
One man explained that the free operation he had undergone to treat a hernia would allow him to work again.
“It will change my future and that of my family,” the man said.
In addition to living in this itinerant hospital and working as a surgeon in the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works at night in private medical practices around Yaoundé.
It is this second job, he explains, that finances his association at 60%; the rest is covered by private donations.
“I don’t know when he sleeps,” said Katie O’Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer in Dr. Bwelle’s group.
He is still in the hospital or trying to find money for his association in order to run these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students like Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in his missions, this is a field learning opportunity they don't have at home.
“We were able to participate in operations to help blot the blood or transfer the instruments to Dr. Bwelle,” said Ms. O’Malley.
This is not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you are a medical student in your second year.
Volunteer students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon, and often arrive with collected medical equipment.
But once in Yaoundé, their pension, transportation and education are taken care of by Dr. Bwelle.
“He’s a hero, there’s no doubt about it,” said Katie O’Malley.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the Cameroonian people is not nearing extinction.
For Dr. Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a difficulty.
Helping others to live happily by keeping the promise he made to his father is something that brings him immense joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this work,” added Mr. Bwelle.
And I think about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Making people laugh and relieving pain are the reasons that drive me to do this.

The Two Frances by Pierre Nora
Perplexed, academics have long struggled to define and locate Pierre Nora.
Teacher in amphitheaters and classrooms?
Undoubtedly, but highlighting its weakness for cross-roads, Sciences-Po, the Hautes Etudes.
Arbitrator of other people's works in his office on Gaston-Gallimard Street?
Indeed, but ignoring the hidden work and underground writing of the publisher.
Inheritor of the chair Fontenelle occupies at the French Academy?
Certainly still, but knowing that such a sacred cannot replace the true holy oil, that of the thesis, of which it happened.
They gladly recognized in him a great awakener, animator and federator of their work, but by noting that he was unwilling to produce it himself.
To this uncertain image the monument of the "Places of Memory", to which he attached his name, also contributed.
The wicked tongues were able to see a giant flea market, presented by an intelligent commentator, endowed with a keen eye and loaded with scholarship, but incurably amateurish.
The two books published by Nora almost two years ago have already established that the one who passed for not writing had a lot and well written.
The book here should definitely do him justice.
Yet, once again, we find the temptation of ubiquity, intellectual wandering, jubilation set to jump as if on foot together from one subject to another.
But it is quickly understood that the disparate objects gathered in this book in such a beautiful title bring the brocanteur back to one and the same passion: that of discovering the constitutive node of the French identity.
Why these dramatic calls to national unity?
Identity: This is a concern of the time.
A short time ago, we were collectively invited to give a definition.
But in the peremptory spirit of our leaders at that time, the French identity was a timeless essence.
All that was needed was to deploy the accidents, and the case, Jacobinism obliges, was entrusted to the prefects and sub-prefects, authorized interpreters.
The one that Pierre Nora is chasing is completely different.
He is not the heir of an eternal frankness, he refuses the definition.
Worried analyst of a familiar strangeness, he wanders through a forest of symbols, stopped at every step by an object in the shape of a rebus, tormented by irritating questions.
This one, which is born of the enterprise itself: why, in a country so permanently settled within its borders, so formerly carved and solidly masoned, do we hear these dramatic calls to unity?
They are so pressing, suggests Pierre Nora, only to conjure up the disorder born of the discords of French history.
Franks and Gauls, Armagnacs and Burgundians, Catholics and Protestants: the forces of division here are very old.
And the most emblematic, of course, is the one that divides national history in two.
From the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two histories and they have two nations, one monarchical, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but did not succeed in denying it; on the contrary, she was anxious to regain its sacredness and all the more eager for unity and indivisibility because she had cut off the head of the one who was its obvious and powerful incarnation.
And from there, an invincibly binary nation, divided between left and right, secularism and Catholicism, worship and hatred of the revolution.
To make this uniqueness of French identity feel, nothing is worth the four steps outside of Hexagon, so that the American escapade of Pierre Nora could well be the heart of his book.
For America and France have both made a revolution, drafted a declaration of rights, wanted to found a new society.
But American cousinhood only makes it better to emphasize what is our own.
There, men who had left their former regime in England and no longer had to worry about it.
Here, men cluttered with an ancient indigenous regime, and all the more radical.
There was a consensual revolution when here she sowed the drama and confessed it.
There are always honored founding fathers, and here revolutionary ancestors of whom it is difficult to make models, and who have killed each other.
There is an institutional constancy, and here a cascade of constitutions, like so many mistakes to catch up and attempts to resume.
France that's gone, France that's coming
There was a time, however, when the French thought they could sew the torn dress of their history, and overcome the curse of the number two.
At this III Republic, a central and creative moment, Pierre Nora showed a lot of interest and even tenderness: saluting those who then worked to repair the revolutionary fracture, teaching the schoolchildren everything that in ancient France obscurely prepared modern France and offering them a unified version of their history.
But this pacified identity has only had a time.
It is being debated again, overturned by a new type of immigration, threatened by the rise of demanding minorities, absorbed into the European space.
The book thus offers both the fascinating portrait of France leaving and the circumspect sketch of France coming.
With, as a bonus, the portrait of the historian, who should book some surprises.
We find out that the chimney was a casserole.
The man of multiple curiosities revolved, slightly obsessive, around the same idea.
The border walker stood in the center of the center.
And the one who had filed, here more than half a century, a subject on the idea of nation, but had withdrawn from the initiatory exercise of the thesis, entrusts us, cum grano salis, that he will have ended up doing it.
True in a less steep, more bursting and more subtle form.
But don’t get me wrong, it’s just as compelling.
For much more than the imposed figure of the university course, this thesis says the inner necessity of a life.
Former hostage in Lebanon: "Return is quite complex to manage"
Kidnapped in Beirut on March 8, 1986 with three members of his "Antenna 2" team coming to film a Hezbollah demonstration, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released nearly 21 months later, on November 27, 1987.
Retired since 2008, he participated in 2004 in the creation of the hostage defense association "Hostages of the World", which he has been chairing for several years.
Its main objective is to give hostages the opportunity to file a complaint and bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court.
Detained for more than 1,000 days, the four hostages of Aqmi (Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Féret were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the Val-de-Gr<0xC3><0xA2>ce military hospital on Wednesday afternoon, they have since been able to find their families.
And try, little by little, to resume the course of their lives.
"Le Nouvel Observateur" questioned Jean-Louis Normandin, 62, former reporter, retired since 2008, president of the association "Hostages of the world".
On the evening of your release, you were on the 8:00 p.m. set of "Antenna 2."
What are your memories of your release today?
Particularly in Beirut.
When I am released, I find myself in the trunk of a car where I meet - without seeing it because it is black - Roger Auque.
He says, "We're freed," but I'm not sure, and he says we can still be killed.
We are very excited, but also very tense.
It is war, and those who lead us are also very tense.
They put us on the edge of a sidewalk.
There are Syrian soldiers.
We then arrive at the website of the Hotel Summerland where the press is present.
The French brought us to the French Embassy.
It's time for the first phone calls to parents, family, friends, the press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
And having dinner in a T-shirt at the French Embassy.
I also remember a short night chatting with Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we have no way to evacuate to Larnaca airport in Cyprus.
Arriving there by helicopter, we take a private plane that takes us back to France via Corfu and Solenzara, where Pasqua boards.
How was your arrival on French soil?
We're landing in Orly.
Prime Minister Chirac is here.
It's a little brutal.
There's an incredible upheaval.
And a lot of media.
When I left, there were three TV channels.
I'll be back and there's plenty of it.
The descent of the flight staircase, the reunions with my son and my parents, my friends, all this is extremely strong in emotion.
Between the airport and my home, many bikes follow our car that Roussin drives.
The bikers pull up the buckle to take pictures and follow me to my home where I have to do a little police work to stop some of them from going up.
The media pressure is enormous.
It doesn't stop, we're well positioned to know...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to see it clearly.
We come out of a hole and suddenly we are under the media fire.
It's a little complicated, a little violent, quite complex to handle.
But we've done the hardest.
In the evening, I'm at 8pm, the next day I'm also on TV.
Then begins a kind of rehabilitation to life, very slowly, for one or two months which are a bit like a holiday.
How were the medical examinations and the DGSE debriefing?
I had the right to a first medical check-up in Corsica.
The rest was done in Val-de-Gr<0xC3><0xA2>ce the following days after my return: radios, examinations of all kinds and meeting with a psychiatrist.
It is not a session that does everything, but we know that we can count on it, remember it if necessary, that we are not delivered to ourselves.
It's part of the procedure.
I also met with the intelligence services.
They asked me questions about the hostages.
It made sense.
It didn't bother me.
How do you react today to the release of the four Niger hostages?
I'm listening to what's being said.
The issue of ransoms in particular.
Some things annoy me, others less.
I'm trying to share things between the questions about my past as a hostage and my hostage hat that allows me to distance myself, and I find it much more interesting to address.
I wonder, for example, about the definition of resilience.
Above all, I am fighting, with others, for the recognition of the legal status of the hostage.
I think there is a problem with semantics.
Hostage-taking should be described as "political" - which is the case most often - and should allow hostages to have access to justice, bring a complaint and bring their hostage-takers to the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and rejoices at the release of these hostages.
But who says these hostages might also have access to justice?
A court in The Hague is set up for this.
Why don’t we tell the hostage-takers “you have violated the rules of war, like those of all the Geneva conventions, we will bring you to justice”?
It seems to me, however, justified, legitimate, struck with common sense.
This message is heard, but not heard, and it shocks me.
This is my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists on the street to denounce the trial of Morsi
Anger roars in the ranks of the Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the trial of the fallen president Mohamed Morsi, they took to the streets.
A mobilization across Egypt to demand the restoration of the country’s first democratically elected president.
This is not a trial, says the Muslim Brotherhood activist.
So far, no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteer has been able to take a copy of the case documents.
It's not a trial, it's a farce.
The trial of President Morsi is a false trial, a pro-Morsi insures, it is he who is supposed to make Sisi judge, not the opposite.
Morsi must judge Sisi for the massacres of Rabaa, the massacres of Nahda, and the massacre of the Republican Guard.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Clashes broke out in Alexandria, police used tear gas, 60 protesters were arrested.
On Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed to the Cairo Police Academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be tried.
Hagel accuses 9 US states of violating gay rights
Since the federal state recognized gay marriage, "all military spouses are entitled to a Department of Defense ID card and the benefits that come with it," the minister recalled in New York in an address to the Anti-Defamation League to fight anti-Semitism.
"But some states refuse to issue these cards to same-sex spouses in the National Guard facilities" located on their territory, he denounced, accusing these states of violating federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these people cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided in these bases, or access their stores.
The Secretary of Defense said he had ordered the head of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure the implementation of the federal law.
The nine-state fringe began with Texas refusing to implement these benefits on Texan National Guard settlements, due to a conflict between Texan law and federal law on same-sex marriage.
He was joined in his refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a senior defense official.
The Pentagon estimates the population affected by the recognition of same-sex marriage to about 5,600 active people, 17,000 including the National Guard, the reserve and pensioners.
Sixth edition of the Play Skateboard this Saturday in Hy<0xC3><0xA8>res
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard takes place this Saturday, November 2 at the skate park in Hy<0xC3><0xA8>res.
Organized by the SK8 Unity section of the Bump Association, the competition is expected to bring together the best skaters in the region.
Registrations are made on the spot on Saturday morning from 9 a.m. and the qualifying phases will start in the aftermath, at 10 a.m., before the scheduled final at 3 p.m. and the award ceremony at 4 p.m.
The public will be able to admire the technical prowess of young people who, for some, are already attending competitions at the highest level, like the young hyeroid prodigy Lorenzo Palumbo.
At only 10 years old, he has already won his place for the European Championships in Copenhagen this year and he likes nothing more than showing it to competitors who exceed him by three heads.
Toronto Mayor Hunts Journalists Who Came to Interrogate Him About a Drug Case
In Canada, the mayor of Toronto is suspected of drugging himself, according to several media reports.
A video brought to justice seems to support these suspicions.
The respondent, Rob Ford, has always denied consuming crack, while acknowledging that he has a penchant for cannabis.
On Thursday, he expelled several journalists from his property who came to question him.
We also believe that sometimes images do not need an explanation or comment.
A case of rabies detected in a cat in the Val-d'Oise
Authorities announced on Thursday that a case of rabies had been detected in a kitten in the Val-d'Oise, apparently of foreign origin, while France has been free of indigenous cases since 2001.
The kitten was found on October 25 in Argenteuil and he died on October 28.
The diagnosis of rabies has been confirmed by the Pasteur Institute.
"An epidemiological investigation has been initiated to identify and take care of people who could have come into contact with this kitten between October 8 and October 28 inclusive," the health and agriculture ministries said in a statement.
"Five people who have been in contact with the kitten have already been identified" and received preventive treatment.
"In humans, the preventive treatment of human rabies, administered after contact with the carrier animal, but before the onset of symptoms, is very effective," the statement said.
The ministries are now urging people who have been bitten, scratched, scratched, or licked on a mucous membrane or skin damaged by this kitten or whose animal has been in contact with this kitten between October 8 and 28 to contact 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. starting November 1.
“As France has been rabies-free since 2001, this kitten or mother has been imported from another country, not rabies-free,” the statement said.
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last recorded "indigenous" case of rabies dates back to December 1998 on a fox and that "France is officially declared free of this disease in November 2001 by the International Office of Epizootics (OIE)".
A case of rabies on a dog illegally imported from the Gambia had been recorded in 2008.
"Rage is a deadly disease if it is not treated in time," the ministry said in a statement, adding that it was transmissible for nearly 15 days before the first symptoms of the disease began.
Obama backtracks on health care reform
In an avalanche of criticism, President Obama returned yesterday to his unequivocal and often repeated promise that “if you’re satisfied with your health plan, you can keep it.”
After hundreds of thousands of people received notices of termination from their service providers, Republicans have criticized the president in recent days, accusing him of cheating the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
“The vast majority of people with the right health insurance can keep it,” he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking about what he calls “a buzz in the news” about the terminations, President Obama urged Americans who received these notices to seek new insurance in the market.
Most people will be able to get complete and better suited health diets for the same price, or even for even cheaper than expected.
“You’re going to win,” he said.
The Administration announced that it should not be surprising if the 5% of the population who contract their own insurance were forced to change their diet because their coverage does not meet the new standards required by the Affordable Care Act.
“Let me address these Americans directly: you deserve better,” Kathleen Sebelius told the U.S. Energy and Trade Commission in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online market in October had failed “unfortunately”.
“I’m just as frustrated and irritated as anyone,” she added.
I look forward to regaining your trust.
It was an infuriated Kathleen Sebelius who uttered this sentence, while she believed her microphone cut, by addressing an assistant sitting behind her at yesterday's Assembly session following a contentious exchange of views with Billy Long, a Republican representative from Missouri, to see if she should join him.
For more than three hours, Billy Long kept insisting on asking Ms. Sebelius why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily waived government-sponsored insurance to sign up for a plan via HealthCare.gov, which she now boasts to millions of Americans.
Vettel launches a special helmet in Abu Dhabi
The lucky pick, Jake Vite Prekop, combined the colors of the car brand and the German flag, while integrating the notions of speed and warmth at the track level.
The German Sebastian Vettel, four-time Formula One World Champion, on Friday unveiled a special helmet designed by a 21-year-old Mexican fan for free trials at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
Vettel chose from 1,500 designs sent from around the world, as part of a competition launched by one of the sponsors, an automobile brand, of its team.
He was invited to follow the GP of Abu Dhabi, with a friend, and can therefore see the German champion up close, on the track and in his booth.
Vettel was due to wear the helmet on Friday and Saturday for testing.
It is likely that he will have another special helmet on Sunday, for the race, intended to mark his 4th consecutive world title.
A resident of Aubervilliers launches his Party of the suburbs
Let us not be mistaken.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, its founder, the "Party of the suburbs" is not only addressed to suburban residents.
I chose a map of France as a logo, it justifies.
When I talk about suburbs, I address all those who are excluded from the big national family.
Nevertheless, his project, presented Thursday at a press conference in his hometown of Aubervilliers, was born from the desire to better defend multiculturalism, this great cultural melting pot that characterizes above all the neighborhoods.
My number one proposal is to create a ministry of multiculturalism, he says.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50, a territorial attaché, now claims to be "100% apolitical" even though he has not always been neutral.
Militant in 2002 alongside Jean-Pierre Chevénement, he then supported locally Dominique de Villepin between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the values of equality that I advocate in my program are attached to the left, but if the right-wing people are willing to support me, I will listen to them too.
It is only the extremist parties that I am not talking about.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built his program -consultable on the Internet- from many themes supposed to speak to the inhabitants of the suburbs and especially to young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, the civilian majority at 16 years, the rehabilitation of the function of guardian of the building...
It remains to find candidates to form lists and defend his ideas on the political scene. "For the 2014 municipal elections, this is likely to be fair, he admits."
It's a matter of time and money.
The suburban party should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidacy and I hope also in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune says he already has seven top spots in metropolitan France and Martinique.
“And the support emails I’ve received since yesterday don’t all emanate from suburbs,” he said.
John Kerry has admitted, without precedent, that American espionage “had gone too far in an inappropriate way.”
John Kerry pointed to a softening of the U.S.’s defensive attitude toward its surveillance programs by admitting, unprecedentedly, that on several occasions, espionage “had gone too far inappropriately.”
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, like Barack Obama, had ruled on “autopilot” when a series of incendiary revelations by whistleblower Edward Snowden about NSA espionage activities emerged.
The leaks put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London via video link, Mr. Kerry said: "It is undeniable that the President, myself and other members of the government became aware of certain things in automatic pilot mode because we had the opportunity, from the Second World War until the difficult years of the Cold War, and then of course the 11th of September."
He then became the first senior member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage had crossed the line, but insisted that everyone’s rights had not been violated.
He said: “In some cases, it went too far inappropriately.”
And the President is determined to try to clarify and make clear to the people that he is now undertaking a thorough review of these practices so that no one feels wrong.
I assure you that innocent people will not be abused in this process.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force acting for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We live in a new world where people are ready to be blown up.”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, blow them up and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
We did prevent planes from crashing, buildings from exploding, and people from being murdered because we were able to get to know the facts in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to address concerns about the alleged U.S. espionage case and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint counter-terrorism efforts with the United States, the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had spoken before members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was concerned about the threats they had uttered about a possible withdrawal of anti-terrorist organizations due to the feeling of frustration with the National Security Agency's surveillance.
“It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain on our side in our mutual commitment to the fight against terrorism,” Murphy, a Democrat serving his first term, and chairman of the U.S. Senate’s European Affairs Subcommittee, said in an interview from Washington.
And I’m going to go to Europe to make them understand that we have to continue working together to fight terrorism, despite the anger caused by the NSA programs.
The press reports that the NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe, which has damaged relations with some U.S. allies, but the director of the agency said this week that it was inaccurate and that it was a misunderstanding as it concerned metadata that the NATO allies had collected.
Other revelations reported documents released by Snowden that the NSA had intercepted data and communications from the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and those of 34 other heads of state.
The Director of Intelligence, James Clapper, justified the espionage of the Allies by stating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides.
In this tumultuous atmosphere, Murphy indicated that his office was organizing a trip from Congress, which is due to take place this year, and that he hoped the delegation would include members of both parties and both chambers.
The names of the other participating legislators are expected to be revealed in the coming days.
He indicated that the itinerary remained to be defined.
Murphy said the purpose of this trip was to improve relationships, but also to show “affectionate firmness.”
He explained that European heads of state should be honest with their citizens about the type of spying programs they have been implementing themselves for years.
“We can modify our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they also need to understand that we are not the only ones in the world to spy,” Murphy said.
In the meantime, Kerry has planned to travel to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to deal with the anger generated by US strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US surveillance activities.
The London Stock Exchange closed down on Thursday, plummeted by Shell’s poor performance and the day after an announcement by the Fed of maintaining its state of support for the economy, as expected.
Australian woman appeals for prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney woman, sentenced to 15 days in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been assaulted by a taxi driver, appealed the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a Phuket Provincial Court on June 15 of false statements after telling Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who controlled her, assaulted her early on Sunday, June 10.
However, video surveillance footage later revealed that she had returned to her hotel safely after separating from her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police interrogated Bamford for two days before she confessed to inventing the whole story.
She was detained in a local police station cell prior to the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison in a low-security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket rather than a women's prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian rugby league player Peter Tunks, who appealed to the Canberra Ministry of Foreign Affairs to help her daughter.
Tunks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about her daughter's well-being and wanted her to return to Australia.
“We’ve obviously been through a distressing time, but we hope to bring her home safely as soon as possible,” Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the verdict and was released after a bail of 50,000 baht.
In Australia, the press said that in the meantime, she was on vacation in the Krabi region in southern Thailand.
Thai judicial sources said Bamford was represented by a local Phuket lawyer, but warned that the appeal could lead to a heavier sentence of up to two years in prison and imprisonment in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder in Phuket of Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agent, Thailand could also seek to uplift its deteriorating image among tourists, which could lead to acquittal.
French police will arrest supporters of Anderlecht who came in other than with RSCA buses
French police have decided to impose strict rules regarding the meeting of the Royal Sporting Club of Anderlecht against Paris Saint-Germain set on Tuesday, Marie Verbeke, the spokeswoman for the Brussels-midday police zone, said on Friday.
Belgian fans of the RSCA who want to go to this match of the Champions League will have to use the travel system set up by the RSCA.
"The bus convoy will be escorted by police from a former Rekem border station to the PSG stadium," the statement said.
The process will be the same for the return.
"If other supporters had an intention to travel to Paris by other means, the French police prefecture has indicated that measures have been taken to carry out arrests or even guards," Marie Verbeke said.
Living together in French, the challenge of the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school commission
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board, 62% of students have a mother tongue other than French.
This is what motivated a year ago, a consultation with parents, students, teachers and educational staff, to think about ways to better integrate students who live on horseback between different cultures.
The school board has just unveiled its vision of "Living together in French".
The organization Vision Diversity has been walking for a year in schools to help students of all backgrounds discover common landmarks that are not limited to the French language.
The discovery of neighborhoods, our architecture, our places are landmarks.
Great names of writers, artists, whether they are of the tribe or they came from elsewhere.
Who are our builders?
“So we create projects so that they identify with all of this,” explains Vision Diversity President A<0xC3><0xAF>da Kamar.
Michel Venne, from the Institut du Nouveau Monde, identified several challenges for the school committee.
"On the transmission, for example, of what Quebec culture is, the sense of belonging, the support to staff in the transformations we experience, within the student clientele," he enumerated.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board has created a research center that will give tools to teachers who, too, sometimes, come from elsewhere.
Rachida Azdouz, from the University of Montreal, will be the scientific director.
Preparation to manage a class in a North American, Quebec context.
"Different pedagogical strategies, that's the real need," she sums up.
Research will focus on inclusion from all angles: linguistic, school, social and cultural.
