He talks too much about her.
She put a lot of sugar in the coffee.
Didn't you know I taught French in Boston before?
Tom was very surprised.
They were trying to win time.
I've already discussed this with Tom.
Jesus Christ, living among the people, spoke in the horrible, from the Jewish point of view, Galilean dialect of the Aramaic language instead of Hebrew, thus showing the infallibility of claims about the existence of some sacred language, the use of which in prayer brings especially close to God.
In the end, Tom changed his mind.
My opinion is slightly different from yours.
Tell her I don't want to go.
Tom paid three hundred dollars for it.

Is this my book?
Laundry is a routine job.
Who else is on your list?
Don't give Tom my phone.
I've already decided who I'm going with.
I wish I knew what to say to them.
Tom's kids must miss him.
I thought Tom was wrong.
I think you need to talk to them.
He reads physics at Oxford.
He hid that fact from me.

I know what happened.
When can we start?
I know what Tom had to do.
Say hello to her from me.

I'm not as lucky as you.
I did everything you asked me to do.
Are you planning to buy a house?
On the cat's table.

He came, he saw, he won.
Life is not always fair.

You want us to help you?
Be realistic.
Tom was planning a party.
I'll get someone to help.
Why didn't you tell us about this before?
Is it Chinese or Japanese?
Fire it.
I'm making progress.
You're pale as a ghost.
I'll be home by 6:00.
French is not that complicated.
Let's get out of the cab.
He was seated.
Tom never missed school.
I suggest you do it today.
I'm not going to marry her.
Tom's drinking apple juice.
Will you take the train?
We think so too.
How could something like this have happened?
You're an actress.

I forgot to ask.
My hands and feet are always freezing.
How do I translate words that are not in any other language than my own?
Could you tie this up with tape?
I'll go home.

I hate people like Tom.

Stop singing.
Only six people came to the party.
What did you decide?

I saw you spy on Tom.
I need you to do it right away.
The robber entered the house through that door.
I know how to survive.
Mary worked most of her life.
Mary's boyfriend's name is Tom.
I'm afraid I have something to confess to.
I was expecting Tom to be there yesterday.
Tom was an important person.
I want you to stay with me.
He's in the hospital.
Don't forget to sign up.
You'll be safe there.

"Do you speak Greek?" - "Not yet, this is my first lesson!"
Why did you give him money?
Did Tom buy anything for Mary?
Did you go to Boston last week?
I didn't play tennis yesterday.
Let me do it again.
We must respect their wishes.
How did you convince her?
I've been to Sapporo before.
I told you to get out of here.
We will try our best.
Would you buy that?
Tom is late for the plane.
She always gets up early.
You want her to help you?
Do you eat rice every day?
We sat in the very depths of the audience.
You will survive.
What did she buy in that store?
When will we have a woman as president?
He came here hoping to see you.
I'm glad Tom did it.
I'd buy it.
Have you ever seen this movie?
I know what you did last night.
The bus stop is not far from our school.
That's the cookie I baked for you.
England is similar to Japan in many ways.
Tom would never have done that.
I suggest you try harder.
This dog does not scare the child.
Don't resist.

How would you feel if someone did this to you?
We both want to sleep.
Tom just can't do whatever he wants.
Tom doesn't often tell us jokes.
Onions can be used in many dishes.

Will Tom come with you?
Where is the remote control?
I can't find her either.
You will speak in Swedish.
Have you seen anyone else?
Tell me why you're here.
Don't put the phone down.
Tell Tom not to get his eyes on him.
We looked out the window but didn’t see anything.
You want to work with them?
The movie was interesting.

It's a fake.
Tom is very emotional.
Why are you avoiding me?
What will happen to Tom?
I hope you don't catch a cold.
He was targeting the bird.
Tom will be released on Monday.
Oh, come on!
I need to move on.
She shook her nose at the glass.
There is no difference between the verbs ser and estar in English.
I know exactly what to do.
He's very secretive.
You have excellent English.
Do you have any messages for me?
Tom didn't want to cry.
How much time do you have?
Writing an SMS while driving a car is very dangerous.
Tom said Mary agrees.
Tom said Mary won't win.
Why did you shave your beard?
I want to go back to this house.
How many pens do you have?
The fork was broken.
Why don't you go and kill yourself?
Tom spoke first.
Did you ask Fom to stop?
You swore you loved me.
I don't want Tom to think he's supposed to interpret me.
I was very calm.
Everyone has something to hide.
We will have a few guests tonight.
Her voice is still ringing in my ears.
Tom wanted to ask you a few questions.
Time heals everything.
Why do you always take his side?
We weren't cold.
I saw a cat on the roof.
All men are the same.
Are you hot?
His son is a genius.
Don't miss the case.
Why don't we have dinner at the restaurant tonight?
Some of the birds did not fly.
What else do you want from me?
What did Tom ask you about?
I told Tom you came to Australia.
You were looking for this?
Didn't you tell me you had a brother?
Where can I wait for you?
I was really worried about you.
What did you find?
Can you explain that to me?
We were hit by a snowstorm.
The book is on the table.
I don't want any of them.
What are we to lose?
You better ask him first.
He was fired against his will.
Take them to the hospital.
Did Tom tell you where he bought his pipe?
She never responded to his letter.
I hired someone to work today.
Stop being such a fool!
Tom would like us to stay.
I'm up the stairs.
It is the largest car in the world.
Tom almost never asks why.
I have to get back to work.
Tom told me that Mary doesn't do that.
Tom gave Mary all the money he had with him.
Where do you usually buy clothes?
I already did.
What's the weather like?
I texted her.
You owe me three hundred bucks.
I wanted to stop him.
I loved him so much.
You won't introduce me?
We can't tell her.
I want you to know that I will always love you.
She said she was ready to do it.
She was crying.
I told Tom that Mary had to do it.
You're both idiots.
Do you like living outside the city?
How long did it take you?
We finally have everything we need.
I wasn't busy last week.
I'm Tom's manager.
Who are you planning to go to Australia with?
Someone was yelling.
Which is better?
We're grateful for your help.
Go to your room!
I didn't tell Tom to leave.
What do your parents want for Christmas?
The train leaves at 3:30.
I know you're hiding something.
Release the animals from the cage.
He's afraid of cats.
You look like your father.
George is five years older than me.
Give me a cigarette.
Do as you're told.
Please, watch this movie.
Someone's calling.
I ran.
Why aren't you ready?
I can't look forward to your new car.
You shouldn't have done that.
You're a lot taller than Tom.
You can take advantage of his library.
I congratulated him on the birth of his son.
Mary says she needs more time.
Thomas walked out the door.
My dad is an English teacher.

Possibly.

We have to help.
Tom just got out of jail.
Did you tell Tom?
Me! Me!
Tell me what you saw.
I think I found what you're looking for.
Let your uncle think about it.
I fired her.
We need to know what Tom looks like.
I've come up with a good plan.
I didn't know you had a cat.
I know you would have done the same for me.
I can't believe Tom did this.
I don't want to listen to your theories.
Tom already told me what I wanted to know.
Only in philosophy can you use the vicious circle in the evidence and get a high rating for it.
I can't afford to have kids.
When I spoke to them in French in Paris, they just stared at me and couldn't get these idiots to understand their own language.
Should I leave?

She really did.
I think it's very expensive.
I'll open it.
It's been ten hours, and my mother must be angry.
White Bread, please.
Owls are cute.
Tom is illiterate.
I think Tom's still out of work.
We are perfect for each other.
French is complicated, isn't it?
He doesn't like fish.
The danger has passed.
We need more wood.
Tom said that Mary was irritated.
Let me know if you need any help.
We have to get there before he does.
He must miss her.
He says he's not sick.
Paris is far away?
What time is it in Tokyo right now?
He said he hopes to see you.
Tom and I did what we were told.
Frida Kahlo was a Mexican artist.
No one knew why.
Jim's not coming tonight.
You'll be a father, you'll understand.
Last Monday, I saw you and Tom.
Where did you take off your shoes?
We went to the beach.
Do you think it will snow for Christmas this year?
How was Tom's party?
I need to go to the bathroom.
I borrowed a tent from one of my friends.
I'll work for you as long as you pay me as well.
I'd like a coffee.
No one asked him.
I haven't seen Elizabeth at all lately.
You're the only one here who likes Tom.
I know what Tom would do.
You won't get a second chance like that.
Tom immediately agreed to pay the ransom.
I have to pay all my bills.
She's snoring.
Tom said he's looking for you.
We're not as rich as Tom.
Tom's pulling Mary's hair.
Tom didn't seem happy to me.
When I grow up, I want to be a firefighter.
Tom regularly eats sushi with his mother.
We forgot to sign up!
Tom said he likes it here.
No, I'm not tired at all.
She's the laziest person I know.
Mary's already cleaned up in her room?
This time I will forgive him.
I really like Chinese food.
It's easier than you think.
Tom wasn't a good coach.
He's a sober man.
Alvaro from Venezuela, he's a Venezuelan.
Here's the bill.
He publicly insulted me.
Tom won't win again.
Why don't I stay with you?
Magnets are used in induction plates for direct heating of pots and pans.
I was crying.
Tom wants to learn how to play the trombone.
Get out of here now.
May I have a look at your rights?
I'll take 1,000 pesetas with you to replace the zipper on these jeans.
How well do you know them?
Why did you ask Tom to leave?
You're too young to get married.
He forgot his sweater.
Tom still lives in Australia.
I didn't know exactly where to start.
That's the memory!
Only love can break your heart.
I have two tickets to the concert.
I should have gone to Australia with you.
Tom sniffed the pancakes.
He dictated several letters to his secretary.
Why do you want to come with me?
Why are you in your pajamas?
How much does it cost?
I've never seen him so busy.
He likes to take care of the garden.
A cup of rice weighs about one hundred and eighty grams.
I should have left Tom a note.
Are you Canadian?
You're stronger than Tom.
I'm waiting for Tom from half past three.
He likes it so much.
Tom knew that Mary was unhappy.
Tom and Mary are doing it together.
Has anyone else noticed that?
This offer is not in English.
I think Tom's good.
She played the sonata.
You can write in any language you want. In Tatoeba all languages are equal.
The infection is in the blood.
Tom didn't want to buy Mary a present.
Does he know me?
I hate this place.
Someday you'll thank me.
Tom sometimes looks at the TV.
Am I ready?
I've been waiting for you.
I'm still having a bad time.
Run, you chickens!
I had a terrible dream last night.
The network is huge.
You got me!
In my opinion, we should pay more attention to the current state of affairs.
I know what you told her.
I only fell asleep after two hours of the night.
Mary didn't feel thirsty.
It wasn't as hard for Tom to fall asleep as he thought.
I don't like it.
I was trying to wake Tom.
They say the film is very interesting.
Do something about it, please.
As you know, we are late due to heavy rain.
I think she's healthy.
Tom was in a straw hat.
Take care of your little brother.
Tom said he's not going to wait for permission.
It's time to finish.
Have you eaten yet?
I love the bitter pepper.
What time do you usually get up on Saturday?
I added milk to the coffee.
How can I change that?
Spain hosted the 1992 Summer Olympics.
I've never betrayed you.
We used to do this together.
My house is not far from here.
I don't care about money.
There are no invincibles.
Tom wins.
I don't understand what you're saying.
I know that Tom can draw.
They're messed up.
I didn’t know it would be impossible to do that.
Are you having fun?
The man was sentenced to death.
Was it snowing yesterday?
You scared her.
You can't catch Tom.
Did you move it?
Does Tom speak French?
He learned Russian when he was young.
Put it back.
Tom and Mary are almost the same age.
I was impressed.
I advise you not to walk.
We didn't discuss it.
Tom poured Mary a cup of tea.
Tom couldn't understand why no one else wanted to go to the zoo.
That was convincing.
Tom shot Mary in self-defense.
What is the difference between faith and trust?
Tom put the paper on the table.
What did you find out?
If the weather permits, tomorrow we will go to the top of the mountain.
She and I both know him.
How's your wife?
I'm trying to solve the problem.
I could have gone to Boston with Tom, but I didn't want to.
Tom was reading an ancient manuscript.
The ancient Egyptians believed that the sun was the eye of the god Ra.
Did Tom see that?
The more I thought about the problem, the more difficult it seemed.
His gray eyes shone and gleamed, and his usually pale face came to life and was covered in violet.
What kind of pizza do you like the most?
Tom was standing in front of Mary.
Take some more.
I'm looking for my passport.
His hands were blue from the cold.
Do you want to be famous?
Do it carefully.
I find it difficult to solve this problem.
Typhoon destroyed many homes.
This man was doomed to death.
Call me as soon as you meet him.
Is there anyone here who can speak French?
I think Tom still lives in Boston.
Let me pick up your luggage.
Besides, I can't dance.
I love you so much, I can't wait to see you.
Why are you in my shoes?
The power is in Tom's hands.
I learned to play and play like my Japanese friends.
What are you looking at me for?
No one's going to blame you.
I'm not busy right now.
Kids like to play more than they like to learn.
He was accepted as his younger brother.
What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
Everyone tells me I look like my father.
Guess what language I speak.
Tom thinks Mary's in Australia.
My boyfriend is a journalist.
Why are you calling?
I don't like people who insist on talking about politics.
Is it red or white?
We are not afraid of battle.
A few days later, Tom found another job.
Tom moved to Australia.
I'm going!
Do it until it's dark.
I didn't expect to see you again.
Tom is not used to this kind of work.
Bring your wife in.
What, the moustache suddenly came into fashion?
Tom said he wouldn't want to spend so much time on it.
You're upset.
My granddaughter was born yesterday.
Tom's pirate costume.
It's pure truth!
Let's go get the tree.
What are these people doing?
I did everything I could.
Tom couldn't remember exactly what Mary said.
Work is my passion.
Why wasn't I asked?
Tom must be here for 15 minutes.
Tom hopes that Mary knows she shouldn't do what John told her to do.
I don't drink wine anymore.
I'll get you out of here.
We are proud of our achievement.
I should have invited Mary.
Tom should have been punished.
Are you ambitious?
Tom ate all the bread I bought yesterday.
She's his sister, not his girlfriend.
I'm not sure I understand you.
Schools and universities are closed.
I sweat every day.
She became a postman.
Don't leave me here alone.
I need to know everything.
We need a cab.
Stop beating the cat!
What were you going to say?
I didn't attack them.
What crime did you commit?
How do we know this man is the one he pretends to be?
King Harald Hormsson, better known as Harald Sinesz<0xC3><0xB8>by, introduced Christianity to Denmark.
There's nothing we can do for you.
You were an honest politician.
Why don't you like him?
I'm in Russia.
He was careful.
I wish Tom could have stayed longer.
Almost all of them were dead.
You have to get up early.
Nothing bad has happened.
The last few days have been very hot.
He wore a black coat.
I forgot to water the flowers.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
After that, Tom never saw Mary.
You can't go into this room.
Did you have any other plans?
Who can blame you?
Can we call him now?
Tom is very gifted and talented.
I'd like to talk to her again.
Mary said she liked the idea.
Tom bribed Mary?
Tom likes to read Herman Hesse.
Truth be told, I never spoke Portuguese.
When criminal cases reach the court, it is generally accepted that there are twelve people in the jury.
What exactly did Tom do at the Australian Embassy?
Tom and I started dating.
The boys marched four in a row.
Tom was very puzzled.
I didn't know Tom was waiting for me.
This fruit is very sour.
Tom's left Mary.
Tom realized that something was wrong.
We had no idea that Tom was going to do this.
It's been another day.
You have to do it right now.
I have to get an X-ray tomorrow.
His bag was badly damaged.
He was injured when he fell.
We are impartial.
I have mosquito bites all over my arm.
Tom, come on, we're gonna be late!
I'm sure Tom doesn't think so.
I don't want to know who kissed you.
Are you keeping an eye on your weight?
Tom's playing the trombone.
Are you from Tokyo?
I don't want her in my house.
You probably won't be able to do that.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
McDonald's is known worldwide for its hamburgers.
Tom made Mary an expensive gift.
Do you have an opinion?
Do you like these perfumes?
The castle's broken.
Diamonds are a precious stone.
Have some cookies, Tom.
I don't want to talk to him anymore.
I have three French-English dictionaries.
Put it down, sergeant.
No one can do that.
Tom promised to come with us to Boston.
To my surprise, he married a very beautiful actress.
How did you sleep?
I have a few minutes left.
He wanted to surprise Mary.
They want the best.
Tom works as a waiter.
It's going to be cold tonight.
She says she'll be waiting for us.
Why do so many people suffer from low self-esteem?
Was it too simple?
What Alice was faced with, waiting for an answer, was a sudden warrior. It was a noisy noise, so loud to break her drum cheeks, and so loud to reach the heavens.
I lost him in the crowd.
We were talking about Jim when he walked into the room.
We can't just sit here and do nothing.
I know you don't know who I am.
Tom decided to quit his job.
That's why you can't go there.
Tom helped Mary get things into the car.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
I know what I've done is wrong.
Many books are published every year.
Tom reluctantly gave Mary the money she asked for.
Why do you hate her?
My washing machine broke down.
You're from Boston, right?
We need to hire him.
I tried to solve the problem in vain.
You should have done your homework.
I was on the phone.
I don't think Tom and Mary are married.
They're right behind you.
This stone was so heavy that I couldn't lift it.
Why isn't Tom sleeping?
As it grows, so it will respond.
We rented a canoe.
Have you ever tried banana pie?
The girl who gave me beautiful flowers is your sister.
Isn't Tom great?
Is he your teacher?
The rich sometimes look down on the poor.
I know what Tom's afraid of.
I don't know where Tom bought his umbrella.
How can we explain this to the children?
I didn't even know your name.
The monkey climbed into the tree.
The language I am learning is very difficult.
Your child can walk.
Is that all Tom does?
I'd rather not marry her.
You know we owe him a lot.
You know I'm married.
Are you really living alone?
I told you I'd be back.
Tom is my youngest.
Welcome to the real world!
We would like to ask you a few questions.
I firmly believe in his innocence.
The president reigns for four years.
I'm glad you're happy.
I don't know if I'm ready for that.
What a long flight!
How much money do you have?
Could you solve that question?
Tom and Mary are here.
Why would Tom do that?
The building has 20 floors.
If you don't go, I won't go either.
Don't you happen to know when Tom's coming back?
I don't have any photos of Tom.
Can you wait a little bit?
Are you going to give Tom something for Christmas?
She won't fire him.
I know you're working with Tom.
They don't know I'm Canadian.
I will be very busy next month.
Tom was trying to help Mary.
She likes this singer.
If he had followed my advice then, he would have been a rich man now.
I made that decision myself.
Can you say that again?
I asked Tom to wait for us.
There was a strong wind.
Tom didn't have the courage to try to jump with a parachute.
How do you know all this?
He's running as fast as you.
We're not as young as Tom.
What time do you plan to be home tonight?
The bag is empty.
Are you feeling okay?
He's stubborn as a donkey.
I think you can be trusted.
She knew she was wrong.
That's so cool!
Tom had a feeling that Mary would bring her new boyfriend to the party.
When I got home, he was watching TV.
Tom was talking in his sleep last night.
Tom is ready to defend himself.
You're never right.
Don't say that again!
I called him, but some girl picked up the phone.
Where did you meet them?
Mary told me she'd win.
We have to stick to the plan.
I'll tell Tom you called.
Tom is very strict with the kids.
How are the negotiations going?
He's prepared for the worst.
The beginning of the story was interesting.
I thought Tom would be interested in that.
I mix mayonnaise with ketchup.
They're always complaining.
Tom's got little snouts.
Do you understand what she said?
You're kind of distracted.
Don't hurt her.
I'd better stay.
Tom came up with a brilliant idea.
She's resting now.
I refuse to leave Boston.
Tom said he wouldn't help me.
How do you know so much about Boston?
Is this a safe place?
I didn't know why Tom was late.
He lost his job last month.
Who were you talking to?
I want to believe it's okay.
She always keeps her room clean and tidy.
I suspect Tom should be going to Boston next week.
Don't walk on someone else's land.
Tom watched in horror.
Tom's face turned red.
Tom didn't know what I knew.
Where did you and Tom stop?
You don't know Tom?
I believe in friendship.
We're done.
How do you like your new class?
Afraid of your own shadow.
Tom was very pleased.
Hunger was an abstract concept for him; he always had enough food.
We need a new curtain in the room.
Can you stay with them?
Tom came early.
I didn't know it existed.
He's left-handed.
Someone poisoned me.
Unfortunately, it was raining yesterday.
Looks like he's asleep.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Are you afraid of rats?
What time do you want to leave?
Her legs were sore.
It's a risk we can't afford.
I want to talk to you about something that's important to both of us.
We need to get you to the hospital.
What is the square root of two?
Tom leaned forward and kissed Mary.
Tom was swimming?
I'd say you're jealous.
I never called him an idiot.
Tom didn't do that often.
I hope we don't do this again.
How many times have you helped Tom do this?
If you were my friend, I would be happy.
I almost believe you.
These jewels are expensive.
I don't know how you do that.
I saw Tom dance with Mary.
By the time I get there, there'll be an opening.
I'm not sure what her size is.
He was also kind to animals.
Tom and I ate together.
You really don't want anything?
Tom turned on the flashlight and went into the cave.
Who's your lawyer?
We'll go as soon as the rain stops.
Thomas walked away from the door.
We have to do this.
She couldn't help thinking about Tom.
Tom told everyone that Mary had been adopted.
Who doesn’t admire them?
We were crying with him.
Don't you want to try again?
Wait a little bit longer.
Why'd you break up so much?
You can make butter, cheese and more from milk.
You don't have the authority to do that.
I have a project for you.
Tom saved me.
Are you a relative of hers?
When you drink water, don't forget those who dug the well.
Did you know that Tom has a son?
I didn't know her name.
Tom asked Mary when she was going to buy a new pair of shoes for her younger daughter.
Behave yourself decently.
You like jazz, don't you?
You're drunk.
I've smoked before.
Didn't you know Tom and Mary were John's parents?
I wanted you to win.
I felt like an uninvited guest.
Are you popular?
The Russians won, as everyone expected.
He blinked in response.
Tom said Mary's happy.
I know you want to see them.
We're on the right floor.
You can do it if you try.

Looking back, I think you were right.
I shot the bear.
I've never spoken to Tom.
I'm just saying we can't trust Tom.
She also has flaws.

Where are your umbrellas?
I can't let you risk your life.
You're photogenic.
Read this book!
It won't happen again.
Let’s talk about basketball.
Tom came to see Mary, not me.
I don't think I can do this for you.
"Hello," Tom said timidly.
Where are you going?
I almost died yesterday.
I'm in pain.
She had no food.
I don't think Tom knows how long.
They're running.
The road does not correspond to the number of cars passing through it.
I think you're afraid of my dog.
Attacking!
Look at the pricelist.
You don't have to come to the meeting.
I was somewhere else.
Do you have any more questions?
A new proposal as a message in a bottle: one day it will be translated.
You won't find a job here.
Can you listen to me for a minute?
Everybody loved you.
He and I are soul mates.
I have a granddaughter your age.
I'm sorry I ruined your party.
I don't need a doctor.
Is that a bear?
How did you meet him?
I've never worked with her.
She started working in her new office.
Let us take care of it.
I assume you're sitting in my place.
I planned to do it yesterday.
It's a little early to drink, isn't it?
My parents don’t like the way I dress.
Anyone who wants to stay can stay.
It'll be interesting.
I hit him cleverly and hard.
Because it's worse?
It's cheap.
Can I hold your hand?
It's green.
Tom heard the noise.
Tom gave Mary his phone number.
Who wants to cut the cake?
Tom didn't go to bed all night.
Open the door!
You called the police.
You're too young to worry about cellulite.
You need to start watching the show when all the seasons are over!
Road accidents happen on a daily basis.
Where did you go to ski?
You went to the hairdresser's?
The prospect is deplorable.
I thought you'd never ask.
Give me the ballpoint pen.
The only way to find out what happened is to ask Tom.
I haven't slept for two days.
She was afraid to travel alone.
You need to find another way out of this situation.
Disappear.
Are you sure you want to do this?
Let's all take a picture together.
I failed the exam.
Everyone already knew about it.
You'd better go help her.
The footballer made a huge mistake.

Let go of the cat.
I know you're all underwear.

Don't look at me like that.
The road in this place bends to the right.

I will never listen to you again.
I have no doubts.
I'm glad you helped me.
I think your English has improved a lot.
Let's go to church.
Tom picked up the whiskey.
Was it hard?
He's reacting.
I've never met him before.
How much did it cost?
I need to see you immediately.
I'm not hungry at all.
Show me your passport, please.

How do we do that?
I can't believe Tom doesn't really want to come with us to Boston next week.
Don't let them in.
It's all happening.
What day is it today?
Let's give Tom another chance.
I just want you to accept me as I am.
I'm a regular guy.
Wake me up before you wake up.
Did Paul kiss Lily on the lips?
Why don't you go over there?

Which one do you prefer?
Here's my ticket.
You can't compare to us.
I saw the car exploded.
The window is here.
Tom's mad at me.
Tell me more about Tom.
He's right behind you.
I'll never throw away my Placement.
I don't want Tom to see me like that.
Don't move!
What's your favorite TV show?
You want to go to the movies tomorrow?
Thank you for your concern.
Tom's suitcase is empty.
Oh, my God, it's burning!
I'm afraid you'll get lost.
I like to go to school.
I offered to help.
I'll be back in Canada tomorrow.
Thank your son for me.
I think her father's a lawyer.
I want to see the volcano.
I know the owner.
It's your dog.
What do you mean?
There's nothing you can do about it.
Tell Tom I'm going to go to his house tonight.
They need you.
It's an orange.
What else can I do to help you?
I'm trying to impress her.
Don't you see what happened?
I didn't want to bother him.
The officer instilled courage in his men.
Tom will never find her.
Anyway, I'm thinking about trying similar things right now.
I don't know much about hunting.
This is the first time I have cooked grilled meat at home.
You're avoiding me.
Why did they do that?
Tom would apologise to Mary if he thought it was important.
How many umbrellas do you have?
You're a gentleman.
Tom quickly became very famous.
Everyone already knew this.
If you want to be free, destroy your TV.
You don't have to lie.
I know Tom's about to cry.
Mom, look what I found.
I wonder what Tom meant.
I already knew that.
I've never met Tom.
Maybe she said that.
Who told you the story?
I don't want to argue with you.
I saw him look at you.
Tom was skeptical.
Tom must be home.
She was the one I was thinking about.
Tom showed the policeman his driving license.
I cut my hair every month.
I told you I don't know Tom.
I didn't tell you to fire them.
It's an acidic apple.
The number of tickets was limited.

It must have been expensive.
Let’s not talk about school.
I don't know where she is.
If you go fishing tomorrow, I'll go fishing too.
Are you taking a job at home?

I want to help you deal with this.
You speak French better than I do.
There are a lot of talented people in our city, but Tom doesn't treat them.
You have six unread messages.
Bring me your best game ever.
We accept checks.
My bike's gone.
The stars were shining in the night sky.
