To the members of the Welsh Assembly who "take them for monikers"
Consternation among some of the members of the Assembly, currently referred to as AM, over the suggestion that they should change their name to MWP (Member of the Parliament of Wales).
The debate arose out of plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly from all walks of life fear to be ridiculed.
A member of the Labour Party said his group was concerned that the new name "rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For those who don't know Welsh, "twp" means "stupid" and "pwp" means "crack".
A member of the Plaid Cymru party said the group's ensemble was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said his group kept an "open mind" about the name change, but noted that from MWP to Muppet there is only a small verbal leap.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly to Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter "u".
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce name changes, stated: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptor of the members of the Assembly will depend on the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on these proposals which showed strong support for the Welsh Parliament designation.
Regarding the issue of the AM title, the committee preferred members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received the majority of support in a public consultation.
It seems that the AMs are suggesting alternatives, but the struggle to reach consensus could result in a headache for the president, Elin Jones, who is expected to deliver the bill on the changes in a few weeks.
The law on reforms will include other changes in the functioning of the assembly, such as the rules for disabling AMs and the design of the committee system.
The AMs will get the final vote on what they should be called when debating legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday if their country's name changes to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote will decide to settle a dispute that has been going on for decades with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its applications for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the name change in the plebiscite, said he would not vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is no longer at the cost of joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin keep silent as the churches of Harlem keep fighting
“The elders I spoke to said that before there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
“Not one thing, not the other.”
He said he could understand that the bars had disappeared.
“Now people socialize in other ways,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods that people usually go to.”
As for the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect, and “sooner or later they will return to where they started.”
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with communities of landlords full of the kind of people who would not help the neighborhoods remain shrines.
“The vast majority of people who will buy the apartments of these buildings will be white, and therefore will speed up the closure of all these churches, because it is unlikely that new owners will become members of these churches.”
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis, a metropolitan community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved in the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation built the building.
St. Martin was occupied by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of 125th Street stores, a commercial street in Harlem that resisted hiring and raising black people.
A fire in 1939 left the building heavily damaged, but as Father Johnson's frigates made plans to rebuild it, they commissioned the carillon.
The Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin, proudly named the carillon "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it another way: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also pointed out that it was the world's first carillon played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who replaced it with the largest carillon of the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said no one had taken his place in St. Martin.
Those who have occupied St. Martin in recent months are a group of architects and contractors, some led by lay church leaders and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish council, the body that governs the parish and which is composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July showing its concern that the latter "intends to affect the costs" to the council, although it did not participate in the hiring of architects and contractors who sent it.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark injures a boy while fishing lobsters in California
Police said a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while fishing for lobsters in California on the first day of that crustacean's season.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach, Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he spent about half an hour diving with friends on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help, when he swam with a group of people to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just excitement to fish a lobster, but that he soon realized that he was screaming "They hit me!
They worked for me!"
He had his collarbone slashed." Hammel said that he sat down when he came to the boy.
“I’d bark to everyone who came out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” added Hammel.
The boy was taken by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said in a press round that they had split a shark in the area a few weeks ago, but that they had determined it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic damage to the upper torso.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach, in Casablad, to Swami's, in Ecinitas, for 48 hours to undertake an investigation and also for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty runners similar to the department stores full of expert assistants.
As part of the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion dive into the beauty market, which continues to grow as fashion sales and home products fall, the biggest beauty product runners will be tested in 11 stores across the country, and soon move on to others next year if they succeed.
The investment in beauty comes at a time when supermarkets are looking to fill the shelves that once occupied televisions, microwaves and home products.
Sainsbury's said it would double its beauty product offering to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current collections of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also gain more space with exclusive areas similar to those seen in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique make-up range so that most of the products are vegan-friendly, something increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the perfume shop, The Fragrance Shop, will test concessions in two Sainsbury's establishments; the first opened in Croydon, South London, last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Online shopping and a change that translates into buying small amounts of food daily in small stores means that supermarkets have to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said the establishments will look more and more like malls, as supermarket chains try to compete with discount stores like Aldi and Lidl, with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has already introduced Argos and Habitat outlets in hundreds of stores, as it bought the two chains two years ago. Apparently, this strengthened grocery sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to modernize its pharmacy and beauty departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's launched a joint initiative with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership came to an end after a dispute over how to distribute the revenues of pharmacies in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
It was commented that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury cosmetics brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in 4 stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have transformed the image of our beauty corridors to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invest in specially trained staff that you can turn to for advice.
Our product range is designed to fit every need and the attractive and practical locations mean that we are now a cosmetic destination that challenges old shopping habits.”
Peter Jones 'Furious' After Holly Willoughby Retires from <0xC2><0xA3>11 Million Business
Dragons Den star Peter Jones left "angry" after TV host Holly Willoughby retired from an 11-million-pound business with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby does not have time for his brand of clothing and accessories Truly.
His company had been compared to Goop, the brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The presenter of This Morning, 37, used Instagram to announce her farewell.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons' Den star Peter Jones throwing sparks as she retired from her last-minute lifestyle brand to focus on her new gold contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources indicate Jones was "angry" when the gold television girl admitted during a tense meeting held Saturday at her business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new businesses, valued at <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, meant she no longer had time to dedicate to the homewear brand Tru, both accessories and accessories.
The business came to be compared to Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, and was projected to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, turned to Instagram to announce that he was leaving Truly, Jones took a plane to Britain and headed to one of his vacation homes.
A source said: "Truly was by far one of Holly's priorities.
It would be his long-term future for the next two decades.
His decision to leave was astounding to all the people involved in the project.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to launch.
There was a warehouse full of merchandise in Marlow's offices ready to sell."
Experts believe that abandoning the presenter of This Morning is among the most profitable stars in Britain could cost the company millions of pounds, due to considerable investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and textiles for the home, and that it could further delay its launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and have a close friendship with Jones and his wife, Tara, for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couples went on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television producer.
Willoughby will become the M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host on ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones stated last night that "We shouldn't comment on your business affairs."
One thought on “And Then We Loved Each Other”
He joked with the criticism he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider "unusual to a president" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said he was putting his voice as a "television presenter."
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim is interested in holding a second meeting after his initial meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump considers a major step toward denuclearization of North Korea.
Negotiations for denuclearization have stalled.
More than three pounds after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at Saturday's UN General Assembly that the North does not see the "corresponding response" by the US to North Korea's first disarmament measures.
On the contrary, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions aimed at continuing to exert pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his rally speech.
“Things with North Korea are going well,” he said.
“We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We have a great relationship now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had had positive results: ending missile tests, helping to free the hostages and bringing home the remaining U.S. soldiers.
And he defended his unusual strategy by talking about relationships with Kim.
“It’s very easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this amphitheatre, we’d have about 200 people out here,” Trump said.
Earthquake and tsunami devastate an island in Indonesia, killing hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that they did not need them.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is an indispensable condition for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they are not going to seek international help, so it is a challenge," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is gathering a team to travel to Palu, it is still unclear whether foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster management agency, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute with their assistance.
Given the earthquakes that constantly endure Indonesia, the country is extremely ill-prepared to face the wrath of nature.
Although shelters for tsunamis were built in Aceh, it is not common to find them on other coasts.
Although a warning had been issued, the absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life.
At best, travelling between many of the islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that had been deployed in Lombok to meet the victims of the earthquake is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of the new calamity.
President Joko Widodo's election campaign revolved around improving Indonesia's deteriorating infrastructure, and wasted money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko’s administration is affected by a large lack of funds in the final line to next year’s re-election.
Mr. Joko is also affected by ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority adopted a more conservative way of living the faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes because of clashes in the streets of Christian and Muslim gangs, which use machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scores the goal of the draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with a 89-minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while still about 27 meters from the Chelsea goal with his team losing 1-0.
He touched the ball with his left leg before throwing a shot at the second stick.
The ball flew over the area as it advanced towards the upper left corner of the net.
The ball ended up falling on a Kepa Arrizabalaga jumping in the air and entering the net.
"I was just trying to get to that position, to organize, and players like Shaq always play the ball forward as much as possible, so I tried to win as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I came up to Kante and gave him a touch without thinking too much and I just shot.”
Chelsea won 1-0 in the break after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward passed the heel ball to Mateo Kovacic in that game, before turning close to mid-change and entering the Liverpool field.
Kovacic built a wall in the middle of the field.
He made a beautiful in-depth pass leading Hazard into the area.
Hazard overtook the defense and ended up in the second pole scoring with a left-handed shot that Alisson Becker was unable to stop.
Liverpool face Naples in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will do the same with Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Death toll from Indonesia tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the national disaster management agency said on Sunday morning.
Many people would be trapped among the debris of the buildings that came down with the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that occurred on Friday and which caused waves of up to 6 meters, according to a press conference the spokesman of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered in debris from the demolished buildings.
Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Man Suspected of Murder After Woman Killed in Massacre
A murder investigation was opened after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with gunshot wounds on John Street, and a 32-year-old man suspected of murder was arrested.
The police asked people in the area to see or hear something from that step forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would like to make a call for anyone who has been near John Street in Birkenhead to contact us who sees or hears anything suspicious.
I would also like to ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, to capture anything with the camera on the dashboard to contact us, as they might have key information for our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the body belonged to a neighbor of Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who thought they knew the woman came to the scene to answer questions about where she was that morning.
The investigation continues as police say they are in the process of informing the victim's closest relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment, but police have informed him that they do not allow anyone to enter or leave the building.
The man was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents have just learned that they will not be able to enter again until a few hours later.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the area is considered a crime scene.
A woman appears on the scene crying.
He said, “It’s horrible.”
At 2 p.m. there were two police vans inside the cordon with another van just outside.
Several officers remain inside the cordon guarding the apartment block.
Anyone with information should be asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 citing registration number 247 dated September 30.
Cromwell's statue of Parliament becomes the last monument affected by the struggle to "rewrite history"
His ban would be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects in England carried out by his fanatical and puritanical followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's suggestion "disparate" and "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate about the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure located outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
They may have sacrificed Cromwell wrongly for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a proof of the opinion existing in the 19th century, and part of the historiography of a figure that many still consider to be deserving of homage.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more late in the nineteenth century than now, as an advocate of parliament under external pressure, in this case, of course, it was the monarchy.
Whether or not that is a complete representation is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is clear is that the mid-17th century conflict defined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing one side of the divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.”
Pig Killer Kills Chinese Farmer
According to local media, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwest China.
On Sunday, the South China Morning Post reported that the man, identified solely by the nickname, "Yuan," was found dead with a sectioned artery and covered in blood near a cortical area in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province.
A pig farmer prepared to put the pigs in a barn on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin on Wednesday from neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door leading to another adjoining courthouse.
He said there was a big male with blood in his mouth.
The forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, almost 250 kilos, attacked the farmer until he was killed.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and smeared,” the cousin, nicknamed “Wu,” told the Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else while the police were gathering evidence on stage.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although they are not very common, cases of pigs that attack humans have already been recorded.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on the farm the couple had in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a nearly 300-pound pig cornered a Welsh farmer against the tractor until he reached his wife and frightened the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "shooter."
“They’re just playing.
They are like children, very curious... they have no intention of doing harm.
You just have to have the respect you need,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy and widespread rains to the southwestern United States.
Forecasts indicate that Hurricane Rosa weakens as it flies over the cold waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains to northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. over the next few days.
At 5:00 a.m. on Sunday morning, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane with winds of more than 135 km/h and was located about 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a valley begins to take shape over the Pacific Ocean and move eastward, toward the U.S. East Coast. As Rosa approaches the Lower California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, she will begin to push tropical moisture northward, which will penetrate the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will bring more than 250 l/m2 of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Subsequently, the interaction of tropical humidity with the valley will create abundant and widespread rains in the southwest in the coming days.
At the local level, precipitation of between 25 and 100 l/m2 will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
The high tropical humidity will cause precipitation that will approach 50 or 75 l/m2 in specific areas, especially in southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
In southwestern parts, 50 to 100 l/m2 of rain is expected, especially over much of Arizona.
Possibility of sudden flooding with deteriorating conditions due to the dispersed nature of tropical rain.
We strongly advise against venturing into the desert under threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains could form cannons that could turn into floating rivers, and thunderstorms will bring locally cracked winds and dust.
The valley will bring locally heavy rains to parts of California’s southern coast.
The total rainfall could reach more than 12 l/m2, which in turn could cause a flow of smaller debris and dirt roads.
These would be the first rains in the wet season.
Scattered tropical rains will begin approaching Arizona in the late hours of Sunday and early Monday, before the rains spread to late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will arrive at Four Corners on Tuesday, which will last until Wednesday.
October will witness large temperature fluctuations in the U.S. due to Arctic cooling, although the tropics will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this involves significant temperature changes over short distances.
On Sunday we will see a great example of drastic temperature differences in the center of the United States.
There will be a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the persistent summer heat will try to reappear and expand again.
For the central and eastern part of the country, a warm start to October is expected, with temperatures exceeding 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
New York could reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 12 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates high odds of above-average temperatures for the east of the country during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have seen the trial of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people followed on six television channels the passionate testimonies of Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stagnation continues and the chains interrupt their usual programming for a late-night news on Friday: a deal designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long indictment investigation.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he is one hundred percent sure that Kavanaugh played to him while he was drunk and that he tried to take his clothes off at a high school party.
In a passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely sure that had not happened.
Nielsen said on Friday that more than 20.4 million people would have seen him.
The company counted the media audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to other networks that retransmitted it, including PBS, C-SPAN, and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has trouble measuring people who watch television from offices.
To get an idea, it is an audience similar to that of a football final or the Oscars ceremony.
Fox News Channel, which largely supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all the chains with an average of 5.69 million viewers during a trial that lasted all day, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94, MSNBC 2.89 and CNN 2.52 million according to Nielsen.
After the trial, the interest persisted.
Flake was the central figure of Friday on television.
After the moderate Republican's office made a statement indicating that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was captured by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning and beaten up by protesters as he tried to get into a walkway elevator to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
He remained with the low gaze for several minutes while being reprimanded, on live television on CNN.
"I am here before you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
They said to him, "You have power while there are many defenseless women."
Flake said his office made a Flake statement, before the elevator was closed, adding that he would have more to say at the committee's hearing.
All television and cable channels broadcast live hours later when the Judiciary Committee had to vote to advance Kavanaugh's appointment to the full Senate to submit to the vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the nominee next week, something a minority of Democrats urged.
Flake was convinced in part by the conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a subsequent conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election had power, because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of 'playing politics' with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticize her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and hurting the national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, September 29, 2018.
In another interview alongside her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, insisted on attacking May's so-called Chequers plan for Brexit by saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU should raise tariffs on the other side was "totally absurd".
Wayde Sims Murdered: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson as Suspect of LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a suspect in the shootings that ended the life of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from LSU (Louisiana State University).
According to the Baton Rouge police department, Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed on a second-degree murder charge.
Officials released the video of the clash between Sims and Simpson and police said Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the stage and claimed they contained Simpson's DNA, according to the CBS affiliate channel, WAFB.
After interrogating Simpson, the police said he admitted to being the author of the shooting that killed Wayde.
The defense said a $350,000 bail was imposed on him.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Forensic Bureau issued a preliminary report on Friday indicating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head that reached the neck.
The department praised the Louisiana state police fugitive unit, the state police forensics lab, the Southern University police are to the neighbors for their help in getting the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement for their "diligence and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2.01 winger was raised in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
Last season's average was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade declared that the team was "shocked" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“This is what worries us all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano pours gray over Mexico City
The ashes from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday advised Mexicans to move away from the volcano after activity was detected in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded in 24 hours.
The center was monitoring several thunderstorms and tremors.
Social media images showed thin layers of gray on the windshields of Mexico City neighborhoods like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in activity of the volcano located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Massive clash between Catalan separatists and police ahead of independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters faced riot police and as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing vote on Catalonia's secession.
A group of masked pro-separatists held by riot police gave them eggs and powder paint that created dark dust clouds in the streets that are often crowded with tourists.
There was also a chill later that same day with the police, who used the dicks to contain the lyorta.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanting “Neither Forget nor Forgiveness” faced unionist protesters shouting “Long Live Spain.”
Fourteen people had to be treated for minor injuries received in the protest, according to local media.
Tension continues to blossom in the independence region a year after the October 1 referendum held by Catalan separatists, although considered illegal by Madrid.
Voters overwhelmingly opted for independence, although participation was low and opponents of secession boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
The pro-independence groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration in support of the national police.
The event was similar but they were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who attended the independence demonstration with his wife, said he no longer had hopes for Catalonia to achieve independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy at being able to vote, but now we're stunned," he said.
Despite winning an adjusted, albeit decisive, victory in the regional elections last December, this year the pro-independence Catalan parties struggled to maintain momentum, with many of their most well-known leaders in self-imposed exile or detained for their participation in the organization of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independency.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstration in support of the police with his mobile, said the conflict had been fueled by politicians from both sides.
“There’s more and more tension,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
"Presenting myself as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression that we suffer from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry arrests man after car crashes into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car crashed into a Londonderry home on several occasions.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. (summer time in Britain).
Police Investigative Inspector Bob Blemmings declared the lattice and the building itself to be the damaged parts.
It is also possible to shoot a gun at the car at some point.
Menga's goal gives Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ended in victory
The rising Livingston surprised the Rangers by leading Steven Gerrard to his second loss in 18 games as coach of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal was crucial for Gary Holt's team to rise to a level after Hibernian, in second place.
Gerrard's team is still out of the house this year in the Premiership and next Sunday they face the leader, the Hearts, from which they are separated by eight points.
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston remains undefeated in the division for the sixth consecutive game; head coach Holt has not yet known defeat since replacing Kenny Miler or me.
Livingston misses opportunities in front of weakened visitors
Holt's team had to be far ahead of the time they scored, as with their control they caused all sorts of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made his way but his crossfire didn't cross the threshold of the goal; then Alan Lithgow's shot came out driven by a Craig Halkett header from the other side of the goal.
The host team was content to let the Rangers play in front of them, aware that they could endanger visitors in the standing ball games.
That’s how the decisive goal came about.
The Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston made a sack in which Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined forces to fix Menga, who touched the ball and scored from the center of the area.
At the time, the Rangers dominated the possession but encountered an impenetrable defense that prevented guard Liam Kelly from much work.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a Kelly stop.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor stopped Scott Pittman's shot with his weight, and Lithgow sent the ball out in another standoff from Livingston.
Many cross-passes were made in the Livingston area that were continuously cleared, while two penalty requests were rejected: one by hand and one by a Halkett entry to substitute Glenn Middleton.
'Phenomenal' by Livingston: analysis
Alasdair Lamont to BBC Scotland from Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
And unanimously, they were excellent and continue to exceed expectations in their upward trajectory.
His style of play and players have barely changed since he returned to the top category, but part of the credit is to Holt for the way he has driven the team since his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the captain, superbly directed a perfectly organized defense while Menga didn't give Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall a break throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
Despite working well on occasions under Gerrard's command, they did not reach that level on this occasion.
They missed the last pass. They only managed to penetrate the host team once. A whole warning call for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives ambiguous reception in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and blue skies during the meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany for lunch in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to settle relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed on many issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's access to the EU.
Then Erdogan headed to Cologne to inaugurate a gigantic new mosque.
The city has the largest population outside of Turkey.
Police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but many Erdogan supporters approached to see his president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters (many of them Kurds) also raised their voices condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to receive him in the country.
The demonstration duel reflects the division before a visitor acclaimed as a hero by some German Turks and criticized as an autocrat by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies after crashing in a car
A cyclist has died in a collision involving a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 a.m. (summer time in Britain).
The driver of the car stopped and the paramedics arrived, but the man died in the act.
The accident comes months after another cyclist was killed in an escape accident on Childers Street just over a mile and a half from Saturday's crash.
Metropolitan police said the officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
There are street closures and buses have been diverted and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Jail: Six officers injured in riots
Six prison officers were injured in an altercation in the high-security prison, according to the prison official.
The disturbance started at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday and is still ongoing.
A “Tornado” unit of specialized officers came to deal with the riots, in which eight inmates are involved, who are held in a pavilion.
The officers received attention for minor injuries to the face.
A spokesman for the prison service said: "Specially trained prison personnel were disenfranchised to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members had to be treated for injuries.
“We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we are clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and they could spend more time in jail.”
HMP Long Lartin is home to more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it became known that the director of the prison center had to be hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot officials had to go to jail to calm a riot in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (places affected by the drought could benefit)
It is rare for a tropical depression to affect Arizona, but it is very likely to occur early next week, when the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa passes through the Southwest Desert leaving the possibility of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday and arrive at the last hour of rainy Monday.
The Phoenix National Meteorological Service said in a Twitter post that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained the state of depression or tropical storm within a 320-kilometre radius of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that stretched a radius of 64 kilometers from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Meteorological Service foresee 50 to 10 l/m2 of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 150 l/m2 on Arizona's Mogoll<0xC3><0xB3>n Board.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the Central Rockies and the Great Basin, could reach 25 or 50 liters, with isolated totals of 100 l/m2 being possible.
For those who are out of danger of sudden flooding, the Rosa rain could be a blessing, as the region is heavily affected by droughts.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of this rain could be beneficial, as the Southwest is experiencing droughts.
“According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second-largest category.”
First, Hurricane Rosa will land on Mexico’s Baja California Peninsula.
Rosa, which will still have hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with a maximum wind of 136 km/h, is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is heading north at 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is finding cold water in the Pacific and thus losing strength.
For this reason, it is expected to land in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or at night on Monday.
It could rain heavily in some areas of Mexico, posing a significant risk of flooding.
"Total precipitations of between 75 and 150 l/m2 are expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, and can be found at up to 250 l/m2," reports weather.com.
Rosa will then head north across Mexico in the form of a tropical storm before arriving at the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, and then will continue to climb through Arizona and enter southern Utah in the last hour of Tuesday night.
"The main danger of Rosa or what is left of her is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the Southwestern Desert of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to cause sudden water rushes and debris flows in deserts, and landslides in mountainous lands.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: Four Detainees Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and found a 16-year-old boy with white gun wounds.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday around 04:00 (summer time in Britain).
He was taken to the hospital, where he remained "stable".
Somerset police said three 17-year-olds, 18-year-olds and 20-year-olds were arrested in the Radstock area during the night.
Officials called for the collaboration of anyone who had a recording on the mobile of the incident.
Trump says Kavanaugh ‘suffered from the meagerness and anger’ of the Democratic Party
"Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the Democratic Party's ruthless and outrageous tactics," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh “suffered from the meagerness and anger” of the Democratic Party throughout its nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where he categorically and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he sexually assaulted her decades ago, as a teenager.
Ford also testified in the trial on his charges.
The president said on Saturday that on that day "Americans" witnessed Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality, and courage.
“A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the best lawyers of our time with a record of impeccable public service,” he said.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment as he spoke of the importance of Republican results in the midterm elections.
“It’s five weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
“I don’t do it, but I really do,” he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere fighting for great candidates."
Trump argued that the mission of the Democrats is to “oppose and obstruct.”
The first procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place before Friday, according to CNN an assistant to the Republican Party.
Indonesia's tsunami and earthquake kills hundreds, numbers continue to rise
Authorities said on Saturday at least 384 people were killed, many of them dragged by giant waves that broke out on beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia's island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday to attend a festival on the beach of the town of Palu when waves of up to six meters broke on the ground to the Luscofusco, taking the lives of many and destroying everything in its path.
The tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"Yesterday, when the threat arose, people were still with their activities on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they were killed," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB in a round of dams in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, logs, houses, destroyed everything it found," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traversed the high seas at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some people climbed the trees to escape the tsunami and managed to survive, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs disseminated by the National Disaster Management Agency showed many destroyed tents and buildings, crooked and demolished bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes took place in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) has stated that the energy released by the huge earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, set at the end of a long, narrow bay, could magnify the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had come down.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of the demolished buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho announced that casualties and damage could be greater along the northern coast of Palu, an area called Donggala that is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
The communications were "completely paralyzed and there is no information" from Donggala, Nugroho added.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is a tragedy, but it could be much worse,” he said.
The agency was harshly criticized on Saturday for not reporting the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although officials said the waves arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur recording shared on social media, one can hear a man on the top floor of a building screaming frantically warning of the arrival of a tsunami to the people who were on the street.
In a matter of minutes, the water collides with the edges carrying forward buildings and cars.
Reuters was not immediately able to certify the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major shutdown that caused communications to be cut across Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue tasks.
Authorities say the army has already begun sending cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees are still in urgent need of food and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport has reopened but only for relief tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the Palu evacuation centers on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia is more than 800.
It's terrible.
During the journey that World Vision staff traveled to get to the city of Palu, where the employees are rescued in canvas shelters raised in the courtyard of their office, they saw scenes of total devastation, said Mr. Doseba.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's terrible.
Even when the groups began the unpleasant task of initiating assistance in the event of a disaster, some complained that they were preventing foreign aid workers with great knowledge and experience from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, funds, supplies and staffing from abroad can only flow if the place of calamity is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn’t happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As long as the government says, ‘Okay, this is a national disaster,’ we can open up to international aid, but that time has not yet come.”
As the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, relatives and friends of the missing people held on to the hope that their loved ones would be one of the miracles that arouses the depressing argument of natural disasters.
On Saturday, they took a child out of a sinkhole.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been under the rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandon, the Indonesian national paragliding team coach, has trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi added that some of the people trapped at the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
“As a person with extensive experience in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel among the paragliding community, he had desperately tried to send WhatsApp messages to Palu's competitors, who were participating in the beach festival.
However, the messages only showed a gray mark instead of two blue marks.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he added.
They stole $26,750 while charging a cashier in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink worker who was charging a cashier in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport police department press release.
In the press release, Investigative Officer Dennis McCarthy wrote that the driver of the car had emptied a cashier in the leisure complex and was preparing to deliver more money.
While he was busy, another man "came running from behind Brink's employee" and stole a purse of money he had to deliver.
According to the note, witnesses saw several suspects abandoned the scene, but police did not specify how many were involved in the incident.
If you have information about your identity, contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye
Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
To announce the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Or be formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has long been known by the nickname of Ye, which he used as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change came before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He will replace singer Ariana Grande on the show, who canceled her attendance for "emotional reasons," according to the show's creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously explained that the word had a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘yes’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said that same year while talking about his album with radio presenter Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, I'm us.
I passed from Kanye, which means the only one, to Ye alone, which is a reflection of the goodness that is in us, of evil, of confusion, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
Kanye is another famous rapper who changed his name.
Sean Combs was previously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, although this year he announced that he would prefer to be called Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, also got along by putting and removing the script and using capitals.
AMLO pledges not to use military against civilians
Mexico’s President-elect, Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador, vowed not to use military force against civilians again when the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students approaches.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that he "would not use the military again to repress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square killing some 300 people at a time when student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has pledged to support Mexican youth by giving monthly grants to boys studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities drag the boys to the criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its investment in I.A.
According to AI investor Kai-Fu Lee, a former employee of Google, Microsoft and Apple, the U.S. should double the amount it invests in AI in view of China’s growing activity in the field.
The comments came after several parts of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even if the U.S. lacks a formal strategy on AI.
In the meantime, China presented its plan the previous year: it intends to be the No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that other countries are far behind the U.S., and we are looking for the next big breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the likelihood that the next AI achievement will be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies: Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the highest-scoring American Othello player and subsequently was an executive at Microsoft Research of Google's subsidiary in China.
Lee recognized former U.S. government technology competitions as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotic Challenge and asked when it would be next to help identify future visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers often have to work hard to get government grants, Lee says.
“China is not leading academic leaders, it’s leading companies,” he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired college geniuses to work in AI.
Lee pointed out that changing immigration policy could also help the U.S. boost its AI efforts.
“I think they should offer residency cards to doctors in AI,” he said.
The State Council of China published its New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Sciences Foundation of China offers funding to people from academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established an Artificial Intelligence Center that is intended to include industry and university partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Information.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2,000 million investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation seeking to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not registered movement for months.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum if the country’s name is changed.
The Macedonian people voted in a referendum on Sunday if they wanted to change their name to "Republic of North Macedonia," a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece and block applications for admission to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbors represents a claim to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonia's Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts about whether the result will reach the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot was: “Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying for admission to entities such as the EU or NATO from Macedonia, one of the emerging countries of the fall of Yugoslavia.
"Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, several members of parliament said they would abide by the result of the vote and would make it final.
The change of nine would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission stated that at 1 p.m. there would be no irregularities.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their vote.
“I came to vote for my children, our site is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko filed their vote for the Macedonian referendum on changing the name of the country that would pave the way for their accession to the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents set up for those who boycotted the referendum.
"We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads high and not through the door of service," Kavadarkov added.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries like China and Russia and join the Eurasian Union.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I think the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of joining the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a positive outcome would be the “confirmation of our future.”
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure that is below the required.
Another poll conducted by the Macedonian television channel Telma indicated that 57 percent of those surveyed planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the result must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would represent the first major blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it came to power in May.
Sergio Agüero, Manchester City player, passes through the entire defence of Brighton and ends up scoring a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling scored a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it ridiculously easy to score the goal of the 65th minute.
The Argentinian forward received a midfield pass at the start of the sequence.
He ran between three defences of Brighton before heading to the open field.
So Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He broke off a defense before overtaking several others on the edge of the Brighton area.
Then he passed the ball to his left and found Sterling.
The English forward used the first touchdown area to return the ball to Aguero, who hit Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right of the net.
"Aguero is going through some problems with his foot," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about playing 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's when it happened.
We were lucky to have scored at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League confrontation.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Agüero received the ball in the depths of the Brighton field that game.
He sent a beautiful pass to the hole through the right band towards Leroy Sane.
Sane gave several touches before driving Sterling towards the opposite pole.
The blues put the ball in the goal before leaving the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to raise the Rockies' party
With the Nationals out of the eliminator struggle, there were not many reasons to force another title.
But an always-competitive Scherzer hopes to pitch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still implications in the playoffs for the Rockies, which will lead to a game of advantage for the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Division of the national league.
The Rockies secured at least one wildcard position with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still trying to close their first division title.
“Although we didn’t play anything, at least we can touch the rubber knowing that the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and the other team would be playing probably at the highest level I played this year.
“Why don’t you want to compete?”
The Nationals have not yet announced who will be opening on Sunday, but they seem inclined to think Scherzer is the one who throws in a situation like that.
Scherzer, for whom it would be his 34th start, did another bullpen session on Thursday and will probably launch Sunday on his usual rest day.
Washington's right is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of the outcome in the midterm elections.
“We did everything we did in November.
There are five weeks left for some of the most important elections of our lives.
This is something big, big ... I don’t compete, but really I do and that’s why I’m going everywhere fighting for great candidates,” he said.
Trump went on to say, “You already see this horrible radical group of Democrats, look what’s going on now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means necessary, evil, and petty.
They don’t care who they do harm, over who they have to pass to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control and we’ll never give it to them.”
“The mission of the Democrats is to oppose and obstruct.”
"And they've seen that for the past four days," he said, calling Democrats "annoyed, bent, nasty and lying."
He listed the Senate Judiciary Committee citing Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, who received strong apologies from the public.
“Do you remember your answer?
You filtered the document?
Mmm..ejem, what?
No, mmm, no, wait... It was the worst body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer open.
They are not tolerant of those who express their opinions.
When my local party’s Momentum activists voted to censor me, the truth is that it didn’t surprise me too much.
After all, they are the last of a series of Labour MPs who are not well received, and all to say our opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she faced anti-Semitism decisively.
In my case, the motion of censorship criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security and on Europe, incidentally issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notification for Friday’s Nottingham East Labour meeting indicated that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of the eight years I have been a Labour MP, Friday night committee meetings have been just like that.
Unfortunately, that is no longer the tone of many meetings, and the promise of a “more kind and gentler” policy was long forgotten, if ever it began.
It is increasingly clear that the Labour Party does not tolerate different opinions and is judged whether all opinions are acceptable to the party leader.
This began shortly after Jeremy became party leader, when comrades with whom I believed to share a similar political vision began to wait for me to be portrayed and take positions with which I would never agree, both on national security and on the EU single market.
When I speak publicly, and it really doesn’t matter what I say, there’s a tremendous uproar and attacks on social media censoring center politics, telling me that I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just me.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the comments that are addressed to me tend to be of a political nature.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist comments every day and who do not give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult have normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party had to foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer so open and that with every movement of “non-confidence” or every change in the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower in scope.
Over the past few years I have been given a lot of advice that urges me to keep my head down, if not so frankly, and that then “everything would go well for me.”
I didn’t go into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago while still in school, driven by the negligence of Thatcher’s government that had literally dropped my class, I have tried to claim better public services for those who need them most, both being a local councillor and a minister of government.
I never hid my politics, not even in the last election.
No member of Nottingham East could confuse my political stances and that I do not agree with the current leadership of the party.
To those who promoted Friday’s motion, the only thing I would say is that as the country moves towards a Brexit that will affect our homes, businesses and public services, I don’t understand that desire to waste time and energy questioning my loyalty to the party leader.
But in reality, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat or political expediency will deter me from acting in what I consider to be the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: an undefeated Ayr gets in the head
The last two attempts may have altered the final result a bit, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this easy-going Premier League match of Tenent.
Now they lead the table and are the only undefeated team of the ten.
Finally it was the superiority of his defense, as well as the fact of risking, that led the team to victory. And coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"So far we've been put to the test in our game and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "We have to admit that Ayr has taken advantage of the opportunities better than we have."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute rehearsal, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, ceded to the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to have the numbers spoken and Jason Baggot made a wrong pitch.
Climo increased the lead for Ayr with a penalty, before, just in time, he turned a shot into a solitaire, leaving the score 17-5 in Ayr's favor at rest.
But Melrose started well in the second half and the Patrick Anderson rehearsal, transformed by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
There was then a prolonged stop due to the serious injury suffered by Ruaridh Knott, who left the pitch on paddles and, since the restart, Ayr advanced further through a rehearsal by Stafford McDowall, transformed by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain, Blair Macpherson, received a yellow card and Melrose took advantage of having one more player with a Bruce Colvine rehearsal that was not consumed, at the end of a period of much pressure.
However, the local team returned and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for scoring Climo when he didn't have the ball, McPjherson scored a penalty line rehearsal at the back of Ayr's maul.
Climo scored, as he did almost since the restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up the pitch in the David Armstrong area and sent it to Gregor Henry's third line to get the local team's fifth rehearsal.
The protagonist of Still Game begins a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears to be ready to enter the catering industry after discovering he has been appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and co-stars with his old partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next ninth season will be the final, and it seems Kierman is planning another life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, though a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "prosperous restaurant business."
'The sea is ours': inland Bolivia expects court to take it to the Pacific
The sailors were watching a naval headquarters covered with apparatus in La Paz.
Public buildings wave a blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are drowned in the slogan: "The sea is ours by right.
“Recovering it is a duty.”
In Sealess Bolivia, the memory of a coast lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict remains alive, as does the longing to sail back across the Pacific Ocean.
Perhaps those hopes are at their highest point in decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision by the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the necessary momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, expects a positive outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the ruling of the ICC on giant screens across the country in the hope that the Hague Court will rule in favor of Bolivia’s claim and that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile will be forced to negotiate the concession to Bolivia of a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has much at stake in Monday’s ruling.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts consider it unlikely that the court would give Bolivia the right, and that little would change if that happened.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no power to accede to Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the ruling of the ICC comes only six months after the final arguments we heard indicate that the case "was not complicated", says the Chilean expert in international law Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate.
And far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years could have been too late.
"The issue of access to the sea has long been blocked by the current Bolivian administration," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales’ belligerent rhetoric undermined the goodwill left to Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold them after this.
The two countries have been without ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court had gone to make an unusually quick decision.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “a fantastic opportunity to open a new stage of relations with Chile,” and an opportunity to “end 139 years of mutually beneficial disagreements.”
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, had been using this theme for political purposes.
“Bolivia will never renounce its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“The sentence is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won’t happen unless it can trust the U.S.
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong, said his nation would not proceed to nuclear disarmament if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on promises made during a summit in Singapore among its leaders.
The comment comes at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart stalled nuclear diplomacy for more than three decades after the summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is "a utopia" that continued U.S. sanctions and objections to a declaration ending the Korean War succeed in doubling the North.
Washington has refused to accept the declaration without Pyongyang taking the first step towards disarmament.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the last line of giant hats that will soon be in stores.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or cover yourself completely from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled on the catwalk a series of extravagant accessories for their Spring-Summer 2019 collection that captivated the public with the purest style of Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible shaders filled Instagram this summer and these designers took to the catwalk their most amazing creations.
Valentino's main piece was an exaggerated beige hat adorned with a wide tab imitating feathers that flooded the heads of the models.
Among other oversized accessories were watermelons, a magic hat and even a pineapple, but they were not designed to protect the head from the cold.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks... just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had their lips sewn and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One of the creations looked like a complete diving gear, with glasses and the tube, and the other was a melted ice cone.
And if you're a fan of the huge fashion, you're in luck.
The fashion experts predicted that giant hats could reach the stores.
The disproportionate hats come just after the "Bomba", the straw hat with a 60-centimeter flap that takes everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that is behind the impossible hat that invades all social networks has brought to the catwalk another great creation: a beach bag almost as large as the model lined with a swimsuit that carries it.
The orange raffia bag adorned with raffia flakes and finished with a white leather wing, was the highlight of Jacquemus' La Riviera Spring Summer 2019 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I hope that the big hats and beach bags will come to the stores next summer, as the designer had such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversize accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for the citizens of the world
Scotland’s private schools maintain a record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another collection of outstanding exam results, which is only reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community subjects.
With more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible level for pupils and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for higher education, for the career they choose and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable topic within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it hits him in the head.
But if you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of the recent exams this year, we can see that languages are at the highest level of the board and with the highest rates of approved in private schools.
Sixty-eight percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved outstanding results.
The data, compiled from the 74 schools that make up the SCIS, show that 72% of students obtained honorary tuition in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish, also achieved an outstanding.
This shows that Scottish private schools support languages and consider them key skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, languages are taking the same consideration as subjects such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in private and all kinds of school programs.
A survey conducted by the UK’s Employment and Training Commission in 2014 found that 17% of employers’ vacancies are due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly essential in preparing young people for their future careers.
These skills are essential in a globalized world, as there are more job opportunities that need languages.
Regardless of the chosen career, if you learn a second language you will have a real advantage in the future with a lifelong skill like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will put a bilingual person directly at the head of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% did not speak any foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, in this case 15%.
That’s why it’s so important to invest in a language for today’s children.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developing economies, provides children with more opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, the language of instruction differs according to the school.
Some schools focus on the more classical modern languages, while others opt for languages considered more important for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what the interests of their children, private schools always have several languages to choose from and teachers who are experts in this field.
Scottish private schools specialize in providing a learning environment that prepares children and staff with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may bring.
We cannot deny that right now, in a global business environment, languages remain vitally important for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communicative skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
You have to do it right.
John Edwards is the director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
Lebron debuts with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play for the first time with the Los Angeles Lakers.
The team's coach, Like Walton, announced that James will play the opening game of the pre-season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It remains to be determined how many minutes he will play.
“It’s going to be over 1 and under 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play a few minutes.
After training early in the week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game pre-season.
At this point in my career I don’t need pre-season games to be ready,” he said.
Trump’s Election Acts Arrive in Virginia on YouTube
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be the first of Trump’s five meetings scheduled for next week, including stops in neighboring cities like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a paused confirmation vote for his candidate to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump seeks support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when it votes in November.
What time is the Trump rally in West Virginia and how can you see it on the internet?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 7 p.m. ET.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address the issue of this week’s trial of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct and who keeps the Senate’s confirmation vote on hold for a week as the FBI investigates.
But the main objective of this series of rallies is to help Republicans face the November elections with a new impetus.
These five rallies, which Trump will hold next week, aim to “energize volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
"Congressional control is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible in the run-up to the campaign season," a campaign spokesman for Trump told Reuters.
This evening’s rally, to be held at the Wesbanco Stadium, could bring together supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and get media coverage from Pittsburgh,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, the latest in the polls.
"It's not a good symptom for Morrisey that the president has to come to support him in the polls," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows endurance to fight and keep hope alive until Sunday’s individual matches
After three individual sessions, the Saturday afternoon foursome could have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The oscillating impulse pendulum is a fully invented sports concept but what athletes really believe, and especially in competitions like this one.
Where do you think the momentum is now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now it's four, so I guess we take that as a bit of a boost," Spieth said as he marched at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has four points of advantage with twelve more at stake.
Americans, Spieth said, feel they have a bit of wind in their favour and a lot to cheer on for, among other things, the Spieth and Justin Thomas technique, which they played together all day and each has three four-pointers.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and is preaching by example.
Those guttural screams became stronger as his round progressed, making a crucial putt to tie the fourth game when he and Thomas were two points below after two.
By getting the putt that made them win the 15th game, he threw a similar scream, the kind of scream he says he thinks the American team is not out yet.
“You just have to focus and worry about your game,” Spieth said.
He is the only one left for these players.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple have four of four and can’t go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only pair that did not make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided them on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and no last nine holes on Friday morning.
That route, and the way it seems to flow their energy towards and from the crowd, confirms them as rivals hitting Sunday, and there could be no more popular players to get a win when the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, talking about European glory is still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dispatched Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourballs, when he teamed up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first run ended up with the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they were never close to leaving.
But on Sunday there will be no one to help get out of the hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to see closely from the interactions between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don’t, and the way they can change a strategy in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and have a significant advantage the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that Team USA has the stamina to fight, something that some, especially Stateside, doubted.
Europe takes a 10-6 lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will enjoy a good advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after leaving the fourballs and foursomes with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a Tiger Woods with difficulty climbing four points to the score at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, which seeks to preserve the trophy they lost two years ago at Hazeltine, dominated an American team that failed in the morning fourballs, placing the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning four games, but they were unable to cut the lead.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from Sunday's 12 individual matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, dubbed "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points from the four initial games in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they fit in perfectly to defeat a disenchanted Woods and the American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with a 5&4 overs.
Woods, who played two games on Saturday with neither pity nor glory, showed occasional bursts of brilliance, but now lost 19 of 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and five in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested in the morning fourballs, reunited as his partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes settling a defeat against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, world number one and three.
Europe could not always win on a pleasant day of breeze in the southwest of Paris.
Three-time champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans by scoring two points on Saturday.
They scored a 2&1 win over Spaniards John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and again won Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
There have only been two times in the history of the Ryder Cup in which a team went back four points in the individual, although as the current trophy holder, Furyk's team only needs to tie to keep it.
However, after being the second best in two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems to be out of reach.
North Korea says no to unilateral disarmament if there is no confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions would increase its distrust of the United States and that the country would not hand over its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important measures to show its goodwill" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test sites and committing to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see the corresponding response from the US," he added.
“Without confidence in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, there will be no unilateral disarmament first on our part.”
While Ri resumed the already known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "gradual" denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded as it took action, his statement seemed important, as he did not reject unilateral denuclearization as it had happened with Pyongyang in the past.
Ri made reference to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an active U.S. president and a North Korean leader held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to "denuclearize" the Korean peninsula while Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea has long sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has declared that Pyongyang must first lay down its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted easing tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'denuclearization first' and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its eight-coercive goal, and even opposes the 'declaration of the end of the war,'" Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can make us kneel is an impossible dream, for those who don’t know us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are exacerbating our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader mentioned at the United Nations earlier this week.
However, he spoke of three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the other part of this denuclearization issue were South Korea and not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached a dead end."
Still, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly it was inevitable to attack the United States with North Korean missiles after "evil president" Trump called Kim "a rocket man on a suicide mission.
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said there is still much work to be done and that sanctions must be maintained until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for that, and that “it still takes two years, three or five months.”
China and Russia are discussing whether the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
On Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council: “Fulfillment of Security Council sanctions must continue firmly and without exception until we observe total, final and verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later commented that he would return to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying he had advanced, just hours after North Korea denounced him for making "mafia-like demands."
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site, as well as a nuclear complex, if the United States took "corresponding measures."
He said Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he was requesting were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and progress toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
This year, a new Harvard University course is making all of its students sleep longer in order to combat the growth of the caffeinated, all-night-study-stimulated masculine culture.
One academic has found that students at the world’s number one university are often unaware of the basics about how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard School of Medicine and specialist at Brigham and Muller Hospital, conceived the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact that lack of sleep had on learning.
“At the end of the class, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why are you telling me this now, in my last year?’
He said no one had told him about the importance of sleeping, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was launched this year for the first time, explains to students the basics about how acquiring good sleep habits helps with academic and athletic performance, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at the Harvard School of Medicine and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students had a significant lack of sleep during the week.
The course of one hour involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on coffee bowls, curtains, trainers and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deficit affects athletic performance, as well as the importance of having a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are informed of how prolonged lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we think they have a right to know this information, just as we have a right to know what the health effects are if we choose to smoke tobacco,” added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in spending all night awake still exists, he says. And he adds that modern technology and the growing pressure on students that entailed lack of sleep was a growing problem.
Ensuring you get enough sleep and have a good quality sleep should be a student's "secret weapon" to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, signal it. Even avoid getting fat, as lack of sleep causes the brain to go into starvation mode, which makes it hungry constantly.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push a course across the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended students consider the option of setting an alarm to lie down, as well as for when they wake up. It is also recommended that they be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can unbalance the circadian rhythm and cause problems to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks down Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another sad episode when Dolly Menga's attack relegated Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1–0 loss at Livingston.
Ibrox's team intended to record their first home win since their 4–1 win in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as coach, which he left his team eight points away from the Hearts, leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership, at Liga Esco.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the break and an inspiring Rangers line-up never gave the feeling that he was going to tie.
As the Rangers descended to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third place and is only behind the Hibernian with a goal difference.
And it could have been much worse for the Rangers after line judge Calum Spence had to have treated for a head injury after supposedly throwing an object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that knocked out Ayr in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup, the Scottish League Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was with the same 11 from Livingston who scored a point for the Hearts last week and would have been delighted with the way their combined organization suffocated their opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have dominated the possession, but Livingston did much more when they had the ball.
They could have scored in just two minutes when Menga's first-time pass sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder wasted this great opportunity.
A powerful free kick from Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, only managed to stab him in the second pole.
The Rangers took control, but it seems they had more hope than conviction about their game in the offensive area.
Undoubtedly, Alfredo Morelos felt they would have to have kicked a penalty at 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless collided, but the referee, Steven Thomson, ignored the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers made only two shots to the door in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly barely had problems with Lassana Coulibaly's headshot and Ovie Ejaria's attack.
While the opening of Livingston in the 34th minute might have gone against the logic of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
The Rangers again failed to cope with the strong formation of the Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fitted the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept the cold blood to choose Menga for a single finish.
Gerrard acted on the break by switching to Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, a change that almost had an immediate effect when the left made a pass to Morelos, but the imposing Kelly ran from his line to block it.
But Livingston continued to devour visitors by playing exactly the kind of game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett picking up one long ball after another.
Holt's team could have expanded the lead in the final moments, but McGregor stood up perfectly to reject Jacobs before Lithgow heads from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton claimed another penalty for getting entangled with Jacobs, but Thomson turned a blind eye again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger accountant
And now a page from our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and counting... was the day that the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led him to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A pillar of science since then, the Geiger accountant has also become a fundamental element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring those seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Home: "What is this in the world?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
By putting on these headphones, you can hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals."
Evans: "Say, I'm sure it's bursting now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name survives.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to ‘See’ Defective Cells
The new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to “see” the defective cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory.
They can “see” a protein common to several types of cancer and inject it back
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of a patient's immune cells, which are altered in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to several types of cancer called HER2 and then reject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "boosts the growth of various types of cancer," including those of the breast, ovaries, lung and colorectal, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to extracting patients' immune cells and "teaching" them to address cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a pro-Trump speech by wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) hat after his appearance on Saturday Night Live (SNL).
The result was not good
During a Saturday Night Live show, Kanye West was spotted in the studio after a confusing presentation in which she praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After playing the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, in which he wore a Make America Great Again cap, he criticized Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I often talk to a white man and say, ‘How can you like Trump if he’s racist?’
If I were worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with a satire starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee about claims of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it did not air, Chris Rock uploaded images of West's criticism to social media.
It is not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with this publication.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had had a bad time behind the scenes because of his cap.
“They came with me behind the scenes.
He said, “Don’t wear that hat.”
I'm intimidated!
And then they said I was going to pick up,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how I'm going to pee?", saying that I would "wear my superman hat, because it means you can't tell me what I have to do." Do you want the world to move on?
Try it with love.”
His comments prompted the audience at least twice and SNL cast members appeared to be embarrassed, he told Variety magazine, with the following testimony one person there gave to the publication: "The whole studio was absolutely silent."
They had named West as the last replacement for Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West left many people perplexed with an interpretation of the song I love it ("Love Me"), dressed like a Perrier water bottle.
West got the support of the conservative TPUSA group leader, Candace Turner, who wrote the following tweet: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR MAFIA"
However, the host of an interview program, Karen Hunter, wrote a tweet saying that West was simply "being who he is and that's completely wonderful".
“I have chosen NOT to reward anyone (buying their music or clothing or supporting their ‘art’) that I think is embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
“Like us,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying it was now "being officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name; he follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapper Snoop Dogg took the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the last music legend, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-handling role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series HBO Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of a macho hero, saying that such on-screen roles translate into the fact that it seems that young people often have to be tough to respect them.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said "something went wrong" and wondered how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that she feels "strong enough" to tackle the problem.
"Personally, I feel pretty strong right now. What are we wrong with masculinity?" he said.
“What do we teach men when they grow up, in terms of the problem we see now?”
Kit believes that television can be partially responsible for increasing toxic masculinity thanks to its very masculine characters.
He continued, “What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television and in the streets; what makes young people feel that they have to be that certain part of being a man?
I think that’s one of the big questions of our time; how do we change that?
“Something went wrong with the kids.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he will make no prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones when the series comes to an end next summer, stating that "no more horses and battlefields."
Starting in November, Kit will star in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he believes that his meeting with his wife, Rose, was the best of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this show, so in a way she provided me with my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 in the family-owned land of Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
It affects more than 820,000 people in the country, health authorities said.
40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, which marks a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly throughout parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way had been reduced to virtually zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in annual terms, the number of people living with HIV or AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was discriminated against in China in 1997, but they claim discrimination against LGBT people has spread.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men who have sex with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV mediation as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked data from Republican Party senators, "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, U.S. Representative Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information of three U.S. Republican Party senators on the legislators' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the statements were being made by "ultra-right" websites and commentators.
"Lies, lies and more infamous lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information included private addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, published by an unknown person at Capitol Hill, the seat of the United States government, during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak appeared shortly after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the origins of the publications was associated with the Waters department and disclosed information from a Waters staff member, Capitol Hill reported.
“This unfounded accusation is totally false and a complete lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these false and fraudulent accusations, was not responsible for any way of leaking this information.
“This unfounded accusation is totally false and a complete lie.”
Waters' statement quickly sparked online criticism, including that of former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial was made with anger," Fleischer wrote.
“You don’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When they accuse someone of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t be angry.
It should not be challenging.
You should not question the accuser’s motives.
It must remain calm and serene.”
It seemed that Fleischer was comparing Waters' reaction to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, which critics accused of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who ran to topple Waters in the midterm elections, also voiced his opinion on Twitter.
“I’d be happy if it were true,” he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his department had alerted "law enforcement entities and appropriate authorities to these fraudulent charges.
“We will ensure that we find the culprits and that they are legally held responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to each and every member of my team.”
Johnny English Strikes Again (Johnny English: Again in Action), Rowan Atkinson's powerless spy parody
It is already traditional to seek the transcendence of Brexit in new films from a British point of view and it seems that this can be applied to the return of the franchise of this parody and action comedy of Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will the ironic satire about the matter of how obviously stupid we are become in the nation’s new export opportunity?
Anyway, Johnny English's incompetent jumpsuit-eye and rubber-faced character renewed his license to ruin things for the second time. His name is already a clear indication that this is a general comic creation designed for non-English-speaking film-loving territories.
Of course, he is the silly secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims of flattering glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a Mr Bean chip and a bit of that kind who contributed a single note on the theme of Fire Cars at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
It is also originally based on the cosmopolitan and mysterious international agent that Atkinson once played in Barclaycard's now-forgotten television commercials, in which he sowed chaos on his way.
There are a couple of good moments in Johnny English’s last departure.
I love it when Johnny English approaches a helicopter while wearing a medieval suit of armor and the footsteps of the rotor make a brief bang against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is striking, but it gives the impression that humor has little strength and is strangely superfluous, especially when this kind of "serious" films, such as 007 and Mission Impossible, already use comedy convincingly as one of its ingredients.
It seems as if the humor was directed at children, rather than adults, and, in my opinion, the extravagant misadventures of Johnny English are not as ingenious or focused as the silent film jokes of Atkinson in embodying the character of Bean.
Now the perennially topical argument is that Britain has serious problems.
A hacker sneaks into Britain's network of super-secret web spies and reveals the identities of all British agents in the area, to the anguish of the agent on duty, an unfortunate little role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the culmination of a pompous and conflicted prime minister, who is already suffering a total crisis of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this character who almost looks like Theresa May, but not much can be done with the script.
His intelligence advisers inform that since all active spies have committed themselves, he must remove someone from retirement.
And that refers to the incompetent Johnny English in person, who now works as a teacher at some snob institution, but gives out-of-form lessons on how to become an undercover agent; in this part there are some jokes, when English offers the academy of spies to a rock school.
They take English back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunite with their long-suffering partner Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man with a submarine captain, an enthusiastic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat lost.
Batman and Robin from the mistakes of Her Majesty's Secret Service return to action, encountering Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is succumbing dangerously to the charm of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous fakes: disguised as waiters, they set fire to an ostentatious French restaurant; create a riot that illegally puts them aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English provokes total anarchy by trying to use virtual reality helmets to familiarize themselves with the interior of Volta's house.
Evidently, all arrests come from this last sequence, but as kind and outrageous as it is, it seems to be taken from a children's television show.
The result is quite regular.
And, as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help thinking: can’t the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
The Labour Party denies it is drawing up a plan for the British to work four days a week, but charge for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical plan that will make the British work four days a week, but that they charge for five.
Presumably, the party wants entrepreneurs to pass on the savings achieved through the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by offering them an additional day off.
In this way, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but would continue to receive the same salary.
The sources say the idea would "adjust" to the party's economic agenda and its plans to tilt the country in favor of the workers.
The Congress of Trade Unions supported four-day shifts a week as a measure for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an ambition that fits the party’s approach to balancing the economy in favor of the worker, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its 2017 general election campaign.
At present, the Labour Party does not support the ambition in its entirety.
A Labour spokesman said: “A four-day working week does not enter party politics and is not being considered by the party.”
The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, used last week's Labour Party conference to reinforce his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" in public service companies.
The Chancellor’s shadow plans also imply the possibility that current shareholders of water companies may not recover all of their investment, as a Labour government could make “deductions” due to perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and create inclusive ownership funds to deliver 10% of private sector companies' shares to employees, who pocket annual dividends worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' if FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could make them change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed at least a week the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court. The question arises as to whether the department's findings could influence Republican senators to withdraw his support.
On Sunday, in an interview broadcast, 60 Minutes reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring out something that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
"They said I was going to the hearing. I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the indictment came out and asked him if he had done it.
He was firm, determined, determined.”
However, Graham’s vote seems to be immovable.
“My opinion about Brett Kavanaugh is decided and I would make an explosive indictment,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened; but I know the following: Brett absolutely denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And the people you mentioned couldn’t verify it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don’t see anything new.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did it do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an impressive star billboard that will act and an equally impressive mission to end global poverty.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people flock to the Great Lawn area of Central Park, not only to enjoy performances like those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the real goal of the event to end poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), the attending public had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful way to help raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But what is the degree of success achieved by the Global Citizen in 12 years of achieving its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a genuine way of persuading people to ask for action or is it just another case of so-called “criminalism”, people who think it makes a difference when signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its followers, driving a set of different goals.
He says these actions helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion set to influence the lives of more than 2,250 million people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements derived from its shares, of which at least $10 billion have already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that so far the guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a company of UK investors and executives that has pledged to "help children develop to their fullest potential", with a pledge to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national authorities and Global Citizen supporters like you, we can turn social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote in history,” The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were carried out to improve nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for The Power of Nutrition project that will reach 5 million women and children with interventions on nutrition.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on your website, “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”,
Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and difficult road and sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, just as it happened with the great anti-apartheid movements and in favor of the civil rights that precede us, we will achieve it, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the artists who will perform at this year’s event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the navy to carry out a "blockade" to impede Russia's energy exports, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior announced
"If necessary," Washington may resort to the navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including that of the Middle East, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s commitment to Syria, especially where it operates at the instance of legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate with energy in the same way they did in Eastern Europe,” he said.
In addition, according to the officer, they have the ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the capacity, along with the navy, to ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy does not go to the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington’s strategies for dealing with Russia and Iran, taking into account that, in practice, it is the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to exploit and replace fuels," he said, while referring to Russia as "only a tactic" with a hydrocarbon-dependent economy.
The statements were made while the Trump administration was on a mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, in order to replace that of Russia, the most economical option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including the president himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said made Berlin a "captive" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which was established to double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a mere economic project.
The Kremlin has argued that Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is only argued for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the idea that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, which took place in September in Moscow.
The U.S. position garnered reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German industry-leading organisation, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), called on the US to move away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," BDI President Dieter Kempf said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully examine her 2020 presidential candidacy, says Massachusetts Senator
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would carefully examine her candidacy for president after the midterm elections.
During a public meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and repair the fractured government and that includes a woman in power,” he said.
"After November 6, I will carefully examine my candidacy for the presidency."
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the public assembly, stating that he was “taking this country in the wrong direction.
“I’m very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren was frank in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren commented in a tweet "of course an FBI investigation is needed before the vote".
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that most of Warren’s own voters do not believe he will run in 2020.
Fifty percent of Massachusetts' "probable" voters said the senator would not run, according to a poll by the University of Suffolk's Center for Political Research and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The poll showed more support for the candidacy of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent support for a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other prominent names of Democrats in connection with a possible 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide before January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin cites Track Palin's Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September
On Monday night, they were arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through, what he is going through again, I can see myself reflected in other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and some of the wounds that come back to our soldiers,” Trump said at a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said his arrest was a taboo subject and that his son and other war veterans, "return different, hardened, wondering if there is any respect for what fellow militiamen and aviators, as well as other members of the army, offered to the country."
They were arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interfering in a report of domestic violence and possession of a gun while he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla police department.
18 States and the District of Columbia Defy New Asylum Policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a judicial appeal in connection with a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or criminal organizations.
On Friday, representatives from 18 states and the district filed a court-friendly report in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenges the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff's part of the price of Sessions de Grace v. that the American Civil Liberties Union presented in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and their children members of a violent criminal organization" abused her, but that U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
Detained in Texas.
Lawyers from the states that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers for the United States, as nations facing widespread problems with criminal organizations and related to domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy repealed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal, and international legislation."
“Federal law requires that all applications for asylum be adjudicated according to the facts and circumstances of the application, and that prohibition violates that principle,” the court said in a statement.
Prosecutors continued to debate in the report that the policy that rejects the entry of immigrants harms the U.S. economy, explaining that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and that they "supply labor."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant more asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and violence from criminal organizations.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on the grounds of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in a statement.
Asylum has never been meant to alleviate all the problems (even all the serious problems) that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of victims doubles in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse.
"Circumstances are very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her febrile baby at the evacuation center of the downed city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance arrives with bodies.
Clean water is scarce.”
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, collecting their drowned belongings, trying to save anything they found.
There are hundreds of people injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, are overflowing.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who fractured his back and shoulder, rested outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to continuous and strong replications.
Tears filled his eyes as he explained how he felt the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save us.
The ruins of the wall crushed me, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in a vault in the city.
“I listened to my wife asking for help and then only silence.
I don’t know what happened to her or my daughter.
I hope they are safe.”
US Ambassador Accuses China of Exercising Abuse with ‘Propaganda Ads’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper preaching the benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred to the China Daily payment supplement in the Des Moines Register, the Iowa state's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of interfering in the U.S. Congress elections, which China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked what officials in that country coined in Reuters as a new phase of Washington’s growing campaign to coerce China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to publish ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught in a growing trade war witnessing tariff leveling in their respective imports.
According to China and U.S. experts, China’s compensatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to hurt exporters from states like Iowa, which supports Trump’s Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former Iowa governor, one of the main exporters of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
In an opinion piece written by Branstad and published in the Sunday edition of the Moines Register, it was stated that China "is intensifying that harassment campaign by spreading propaganda advertisements in the free American press."
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government takes advantage of the cherished American tradition of freedom of expression and press by publishing a paid announcement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the contrary, at the newspaper station at the end of this Beijing street, there are few dissenting voices and no real reflection is seen of the disparate views that the Chinese may have on China’s worrisome economic trajectory, given that the media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party,” he added.
It also claims that "one of China's most important newspapers declined the offer to publish" its article, although it has not confirmed which newspaper it is.
Kavanaugh's disaster loses women's Republican vote just days after midterm elections
Although many leading Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, despite various accusations of sexual assault, analysts warn of a violent reaction, especially from female voters, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The reactions around these accusations were numerous and the majority of Republicans positioned themselves to proceed with the vote.
"These things cannot be undone," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse's Maxwell School in an article published Sunday in The Hill.
Reeher also stated that he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) last minute for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm the mood of angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, nor will they forget it in the near future or in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn.
On Friday morning, opponents of the "Near November!" flu protested in the Senate hallway, while Republicans, controlled by the Judiciary Committee, decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's appointment, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"The motivation and enthusiasm of the Democrats will exceed any expectation," Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst, told the news site.
“It’s already high.
But it goes even further, especially among the undecided voting women of the suburbs or those who are between 18 and 29 years old, who, although they do not like the President, do not usually go to the polls.
Before Ford's public testimony detailed his accusations of sexual assault against Supreme Court candidates, analysts suggested it was possible to suffer a violent reaction if the Republicans went ahead with the confirmation.
"This has become a disaster for the Republican Party," Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
"This goes beyond the committee vote, the final vote or whether or not Kavanaugh will sit in the defendants' bench. The problem is how the Republicans handled this and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats elect on the news channel.
However, it seems that Americans are divided between whether to believe the testimony of Ford or that of Kavanaugh, although they are more inclined to support the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41% of respondents believe Ford’s testimony entirely or probably, compared with 35% who support Kavanaugh’s testimony.
In addition, 38% believe that Kavanaugh is most likely to lie during his testimony, compared with 30% who think the same about Ford.
Under pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as those of at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath that Kavanaugh attacked him in a drunken state when he was 17.
On the contrary, Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her the genitals at a college party when she was studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web wants to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of this technology legend, is a company based on Solid, Berners-Lee's open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people can access which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee agreed that the hidden intent of Inrupt is "to dominate the world."
"We have to do it," he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "online personal data store" or POD.
Contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music, and other personal and professional tools may be included.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were available in a single browser at the same time.
All this makes this personal data store unique is that the user has full control over who can access what information.
The company describes this as “personal empowerment through data.”
Inrupt’s idea, according to its president John Bruce, is that the company brings appropriate resources, processes and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently comprised of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security company owned by IBM, some developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, developers around the world could create their own decentralized applications with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that neither he nor his team spoke to "Facebook nor Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change that would change their business models overnight.
"We don't need your permission."
In an article published Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of a new Solid-based web."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has emerged as an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee continues to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, as well as the Web Foundation and Open Data Institute organizations.
“I’m very optimistic about this new era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Homage to Bernard Vann, cleric awarded with the Cross of Victory in World War I
The only cleric of the Church of England who was awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I received a posthumous homage in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded on September 29, 1918, in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was assassinated by a sniper four days later without knowing that he would be awarded the highest British military award.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren were tasked with discovering a memorial in his honor at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, emphasized the symbolism of discovering this monument just 100 years after his grandfather’s feat that earned him the title.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a dense fog and under the yoke of an intense machine gun fire".
Later he hastened to reach the line of fire and, with "great courage", directed the line forward before rushing with a cannon and without anyone's help, and knocking down three people from the enemy detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was assassinated by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something he could never live with, but a lesson still.”
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also placed a flower crown after the parade, which led the Brentwood Imperial youth band.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honoured to participate in the parade" and added that "the value of this genuine hero is demonstrated by the support of so many people."
Peppa Pig cuts MMA fans off at the best time
Imagine that you take all night smart to enjoy the full show of Bellator 206, and when it comes to the best part something stops you.
The San Jose cartel included 13 fights, six of which were the main ones, and was being broadcast live in the UK on Channel 5.
But at 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to see each other’s faces, viewers in the UK were perplexed when they saw Peppa Pig appear.
Some were not impressed after having spent so many smart hours waiting to see the fight.
One fan described the change to these children's cartoons on Twitter as "a very distasteful joke".
“State regulations state that that content was not appropriate for 6 a.m., and therefore had to be switched to children’s programming,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of Marketing and Communication, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa Pig, that's it."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said he would take UK viewers into account in future programming.
“I think we can solve it when we think about repetition,” Coker said.
"But if it's 6:00 in the morning there, we can't solve it until Sunday, which is already Monday for them.
But we are working to find a solution.
When the change occurred I began to receive a lot of messages and not all of them were pleasant.
We were trying to solve it because we thought it was a technical error.
No, it was a government problem.
I promise it won’t happen again.
We would limit ourselves to five fights, rather than six. We wanted to give the maximum to our fans, but let's go and
It's a lot of anger."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior due to his sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old athlete claims he didn’t realize that not everyone was like him until he got to high school.
Guest of the first broadcast of Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs program led by Lauren Laverne, he explained that he began talking about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also shared that being a father helped him relativize the importance of winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular host of this show, is sick.
As a guest on the first Laverne-led program, Daley shared that she felt "inferior" to the rest of the people because "it was not socially acceptable for you to like boys and girls."
“To this day, that feeling of inferiority and being different is what has given me the strength to succeed,” he said.
He wanted to prove that he was “someone” so that people would not be disappointed in discovering his sexuality.
With two bronze Olympic medals, he became a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at the Commonwealth Games of Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He decided to speak out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly and without fear of repercussions, and he wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "was quite a surprise."
Daley married this Oscar winner last year and claims that the 20 years of difference between them were never a problem.
"When you live so long in such a short time" (at just 14 years of age he first participated in the Olympic Games and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone your age who has experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple had their first child in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and this birth caused Daley to completely change her perspective.
“If you asked me last year, my biggest motivation would be to win a gold medal,” he said.
"But now I know that there are far more important things than an Olympic gold medal.
For me, my medal is Robbie.”
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley's father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked his son were tickets to London 2012, he wanted to be in the front row.
“I wasn’t able to tell him I wouldn’t be here to occupy that front row,” Daley shared.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it was at that very moment, at the moment of his death, that I realized that it was not really invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
"At that moment I knew that was the dream of my life: to jump in front of a crowd in my country participating in the Olympics, there was no better feeling," he said.
The choice of Heather Small's song Proud is also not in vain, as it is the melody that accompanied her during her preparation for the Olympics and still puts her hair on top.

A Mickelson in low form ended up on the Ryder Cup bench on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will break a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but must improve his technique so that it does not turn into an unfortunate event.
Mickelson, who participates in the biennial event for the 12th time, stayed at the bank at the decision of Captain Jim Furyk and was unable to participate in the fourballs or the foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of action, as so many other times for the United States, the five-time champion spent the day cheering and working to improve his movements.
Although he was never the most accurate of the players, not even at the height of his career, at the age of 48 he does not fit in the adjusted Le Golf National course, where the tall grass usually punishes the wrong shots.
And if that wasn't enough, Mickelson faced off in Sunday's ninth game against British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who joined Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, four points below at the start of the 12 individual games, start well, Mickelson’s performance could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk trusted her husband, though he could not say much more.
"He perfectly understood the role he was playing today, slapped me in the shoulder, crossed my arm and told me that tomorrow I would be ready," Furyk shared.
“I had full confidence in myself.
It has a prominent place in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to the teams last week and this week.
I didn’t think I’d play two games.
I thought I’d play more, but in the end that’s how things are and that’s how we thought they should be.
Like everyone else, I want to be out there.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo’s record in the most games played in the Ryder Cup.
He could mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, a race that never reached the level of his individual palmares.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk claims that his presence also provides intangibles to the team.
“He’s a funny, sarcastic person, with genius and he likes to get in with people, he’s a good guy to have on the team.”
"I like to see how well the younger players have spent with him this week.
It’s a lot more with a good player.”
The captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, fears the disappearance of the advantage.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable advantage on the last day of individual Ryder Cup can easily become an annoying journey.
The Great Dane debuted in 1997 in a game at Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but they ended up reaching the finish line with a minimal lead winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You still think we had a big advantage in Valderrama; just like in Brookline, where we lost, but in Valderrama we won by little,” Bjorn reflects, in the photo, after seeing the 2018 promotion win 5-3 on Friday and, yesterday, 10-6 at Le Golf National.
History shows that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow we have to go through it all.
You have to go out and do the right thing.
This does not end until the points are on the marker.
Our goal is to win that trophy, and we have to focus on that.
I won’t get tired of saying that, I’m focused on our 12 players on our side, but I’m also very aware of what’s on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Delighted with the performance of his players on a hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never sing victory before time.
Tomorrow we will face another beast.
Tomorrow is the day of individual performances, and then we also have to prove our worth.
It’s great to be with a partner at your side when things go well, but when you face things individually, then you put your golfing ability to the test.
That’s the message you need to convey to the players, who will get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he must also get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will seek to have his players perform better individually than his teammates, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself was on both ends of those last-day laps, being part of the winning team at Brookline, but finishing as a loser after European miracle at Medinah."
"I remember every damn word," he said when asked if he remembered how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had gathered the players in front of the last day.
"We have 12 important matches, but you would like to have a quick start like Brookline or Medinah.
When you see the impulse going in one direction, there is a lot of pressure in these intermediate parties.
We prepare our line-up with this in mind and put the players as we thought they were, we want to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the fight and face Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans, in the top half of the standings.
“I decided this order because I think it covers the whole way,” Bjorn explained about his selection for the individuals.
Germany's new warship postponed once again
The German Navy's newest frigate should have been delivered in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era warships, but it won't arrive until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, was delayed until the first half of 2019, a military spokesman told Die Zeit newspaper.
The ship was supposed to be incorporated into the Navy in 2014, but the problems following the delivery affected the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships, which the Navy commissioned in 2007, will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, with different anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as concealment technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, it should be possible to deploy the younger frigates up to two years outside the ports of origin.
However, as Die Zeit well points out, these continuous delays mean that warships with the latest technology, which will allow Germany to project its power abroad, will be outdated when they enter service.
The unfortunate F125 frigate was news last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a builder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind this return, but German media spoke of "crucial defects in software and hardware" that made it impossible to use the warship on a combat mission.
Software defects were particularly significant, as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships would be operated by a crew of 120 sailors; that is, half of the personnel needed in the former Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, the ship was found to have a dramatic excess weight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add improvements in the future.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is thought to weigh twice as much as the similar-class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the total cost of the project, which includes crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached an astonishing amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3100 million, compared to the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2200 million.
The problems of the younger frigates are of particular importance in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is making water.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defense committee of the German parliament, acknowledged that the Navy is running out of ships fit to deploy.
The officer claims that this problem is growing, as the old ships have been removed, but not replaced by others.
He also regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class had been able to join the Navy.
National Trust spying on the secret life of bats
A new research is being conducted on a farm in the Scottish Highlands to reveal how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
The results are expected to shed light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
This study led by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland Association will follow the bats Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Pipistrellus pipistrellus, as well as the bat Myotis daubentonii and Plecotus auritus in the gardens of Inverewe in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed in key locations around the property to monitor the activities of bats during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys with manual detectors.
A sound analysis by experts from all recordings will determine the frequency of bat calls and what each species is doing.
A habitat map will then be drawn up to create a detailed picture of the scale of the landscape of your behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS's nature conservation adviser, hopes the results will show which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows and what is the best way to maintain forests for bats and other associated species.
Butterfly populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined considerably in the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development works that affect children and the loss of habitat.
Aircraft generators and lighthouses also pose a risk, as well as fly-glue traps, some chemical construction material treatments, and domestic cat attacks.
The bats are not blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when hunting.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to locate insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who conduct surveys periodically, inspections of children and, sometimes, even rescues.
The organisation even has Scotland's only and first bat reserve on Threeve Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, Estate Manager, says this is the ideal territory for them.
“In Threate we have a large area for bats,” he says.
“We have old buildings, historic trees and a great habitat.
But there are many things we don’t yet know about bats, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
It highlights the importance of controlling the presence of bats before performing maintenance tasks on the property, since it is possible that the unintentional destruction of a single maternity child can kill up to 400 females and offspring, which could exterminate an entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass or annoy them, as well as destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official with the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages people to help:
“There’s still a lot to learn about bats, and in the case of many species, we don’t know what’s going on with their populations.”
Ronaldo dismisses rape lawsuits and his lawyers prepare to sue German publication
Cristiano Ronaldo describes the allegations of rape against him as false, claiming that the only thing people want is to make themselves known using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel for publishing these accusations.
The Portugal and Juventus forward was charged with raping Kathryn Mayorga, an American woman, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
The footballer reportedly paid the woman $375,000 for not saying anything about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Hours after its release, 33-year-old Ronaldo smeared this fake news in a live video from his Instagram account, which has 142 million followers.
“No, not a thousand times.
What was said today is false," the five-time Golden Ball winner told the camera.
“People want to know themselves by my name.
It's normal,
They want to be famous by just saying my name, it’s part of my job.
I am a happy and respectable man,” added the player smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the charges, which they describe as "an inadmissible statement of suspicion in the area of privacy," according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages for an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations of recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2019, in a suite of the Palm Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga had returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed in the Clark County District Court of Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo, after the alleged incident, kneeled down saying that he was 99% a knight, but that that 1% had betrayed him.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirms that both parties had consented to sexual intercourse.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographs of the wounds, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she felt terrified of retaliation and was concerned about public derision.
The 34-year-old woman says she is seeking to revoke the agreement while she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged crime, Ronaldo was about to reunite with Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he joined the Italian giant Juve in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: Automobile manufacturers will leave the UK
The UK would forever lament the loss of its position as the world leader in automotive manufacturing after Brexit, according to Secretary of Business Greg Clark.
He added that it was worrying that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
“We need to make a deal,” Clark added.
The Japanese automaker said that if no agreement was reached on Brexit, the impact of delays at the border could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis models, produced some 150,000 vehicles last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
"In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will be witnessing how production stops at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's general manager at Burnaston.
Other UK automakers also voiced fears of leaving the EU without reaching an agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW confirmed that it would close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
One of the main concerns of car manufacturers is the supply chain risk in case no agreement is reached in Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is well-adjusted, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without reaching an agreement, the border could be affected and there could be delays and shortages of pieces.
The company claims that it would be impossible for Toyota to maintain a normal pace for more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, so production would have to stop.
Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future EU relations is "precisely calibrated to avoid said border controls."
"It is essential to have a deal. And we want it to be the best deal, so enjoy the current success but also make the most of this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
“The experience of Toyota and other manufacturers is that it is necessary to continue these excellent supply chains.”
Toyota could not estimate how long production would be halted, but warned that in the long run the added costs would reduce the plant's competition and could even cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, Burnaston employee for 24 years and union coordinator for Unite, said that its members are increasingly concerned: "From experience, I know that once these jobs disappear, they never come back.
A government spokesman said they presented a precise and screenable plan for the future relationship between the UK and the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be happy again
The White House said the high-risk meeting between Donald Trump and Undersecretary of Justice Rosenstein could be delayed another week due to the fight for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Russia’s aides and Trump, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump fires the deputy attorney general or not, which would jeopardize Mueller’s independence, Trump has fueled rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke about using a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of ousting the president through the 25th Amendment.
However, Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, amid reports that he was on the verge of resigning.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was in New York on Thursday.
Trump said he would rather not have to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accuse him of inappropriate sexual conduct, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate vote.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's press secretary, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he replied: "There's still no set date, it could be this week or it could be a week later, given everything that's going on in the Supreme Court.
We’ll see, but you know I like the press to be informed.”
Some journalists questioned that claim, as Sanders has been running since September 10 without holding a press conference.
When presenter Chris Wallace asked him why,
Sanders said the lack of briefings was not due to an aversion to the reporters' grandiosity, although he added that she would not be the one to deny that attitude.
He also suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president grants more interviews than the previous president," he said, although he did not cite any source who endorsed the data.
"If the press has the opportunity to ask directly to the President of the United States, that is far better than asking questions to the President of the United States," Sanders said.
You are witnessing how we have been doing this over the past few weeks, and that will replace a press conference where you can speak directly with the President of the United States."
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
However, solo press conferences are scarce.
Perhaps the president demonstrated the motive this week in New York, with a free and sometimes strange appearance before the assembled journalists.
A letter from the Ministry of Health to calm the mood in the face of Brexit
The Health Ministry has sent a letter to EU workers at Scotland’s NHS expressing the country’s gratitude and expressing its desire to stay in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months after the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government has pledged to cover the cost of covered status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on abandonment continued, and decisions are expected to be reached this fall.
However, the UK government, for its part, has also stepped up its preparations for a possible non-agreement situation.
I know this is a period of inquiries for everyone.
That is why I want to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each of the staff members, regardless of their nationality.
The partners of the European Union and beyond, bring an indisputable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here with us.”
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury during Saturday's (31-27) defeat to the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
Apparently, he fainted as he reached the band line.
The trainers and medical staff gave him oxygen on the band line before taking him to bed for a further evaluation.
A Tennessee State technician informed Chris Harris, a WSMV journalist in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
He added that there are still no details of the type or extent of the injury, and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student in a red T-shirt, is in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five innings in total on Saturday before leaving the game, which raised his season total to 18.
A stamp tax will be applied to foreign buyers who purchase a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher toll when they purchase a property in the UK. This additional money will be used to help homeless people under the new conservative plans.
This measure will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters
The increase in the bell tax will apply to those people who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher toll when buying a property in the UK. Theresa May will announce that this additional money will be used to help homeless people.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters with promises to promote more accessible housing and focus on high-income people.
The increased bell tax will apply to people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the money raised will serve to support the government’s campaign to reduce the number of people sleeping on the street.
The surcharge, which is added to the current timbre tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for second homes and purchases for rent, can be up to 3%.
The farm expects the change to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
About 13% of new construction in London is marketed by non-residents in the UK, which is causing an increase in prices and making it difficult for people who want to buy a home for the first time to have more difficulty accessing the real estate market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially the capital, have become "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson applied for a tax cut to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the big builders of keeping house prices high by buying land and not using it, and urged Mrs. May to eliminate the percentages of tax revenues on moderately priced houses to fix the "home sector shame" that lives in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced an attractive series of housing-related reform proposals, including the control of rents and the ban on defiances in which the tenant is not to blame.
It also wants to give municipalities greater powers when it comes to building new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream: that life should be better for every new generation.
And for that, it is necessary to fix the disastrous housing market.
Britain will always be open to what it wants to live, work and start a life here.
However, it is not fair that it is as easy for those people who do not live in the UK, as for companies based abroad, to buy homes as it is for working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is too far away, and the indignity of not having a roof remains too real.
Jack Ross: "My last ambition is to train Scotland"
Sunderland manager Jack Ross has stated that his "last ambition" is to become Scotland's coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is enjoying the challenge of reviving the Northwestern club, which currently occupies third place in League One, three points away from his head.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“When I was a player, my dream was to play for my country.
I played once in Team B, and that’s it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportssound programme.
"I grew up watching Scotland play at Hampden many times with my father when I was a kid, something I always wanted to live again.
But that opportunity will only come if I succeed in running a club.”
Ross's predecessors in the Sunderland coaching position included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic claims that he felt no concern at all for the success of such consolidated figures in such a large club after previously rejecting proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Will my success at this time depend on whether I can return this club to the Premier League?
Because the structure and facilities of the club are undoubtedly the property of a Premier League club," he said.
"It's not going to be an easy task to get there, but I probably only think I've succeeded here if I can bring the club back to the Premier."
Ross has only been a coach for three years after a stint at Dumbarton and a 15-month stint with Hearts' technical staff.
In that period he helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and managed to get St Mirren to go down to win the Championship title the following season.
Ross claims to feel more comfortable now than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“I probably found myself at a real crossroads,” he recalled, about taking charge of Alloa.
“I really thought that training was perfect for me, even more than playing.
It sounds weird because I didn’t feel bad, I made a reasonably good living and enjoyed some successes.
Playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things you have to overcome every week.
I continue to suffer from stress and work-related stress, but I like to train.
I’ve always enjoyed training and now that I’m doing it, I feel more comfortable than ever in my adult life.”

According to a survey, the perfect time to take a pint is at 17:30 on a Saturday.
The summer heatwave increased consumption in British pubs with more difficulty, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars experienced 2.7 percent growth during July, but consumption in restaurants fell 4.8 percent according to the figures.
Peter Martin, a member of CGA’s trade advisory, in charge of compiling the figures, said: “The sunny days and England’s longer-than-expected stay in the World Cup led to a similar pattern in July, with pubs enjoying a 2.8 percent increase in consumption.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant turnover during June worsened during July.
Pubs and bars specializing in beverages were the ones that achieved the best results with increases in consumption higher than the reductions experienced by restaurants.
Pubs specializing in food also suffered from the sun, though not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
It’s like people just want to go out drinking.
In controlled pubs and bars, the consumption of beverages increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and that of meals decreased by three percent.
Paul Newman, an employee of RSM’s leisure and hospitality analysis company, said: “These results represent a continuation of the trend that has been taking place since the end of April.
Time and the impact of major social and sporting events continue to be the main factors in relation to consumption outside the home.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to suffer, however, a fall of 4.8 percent annually will be especially painful if added to this by the continuous increase in costs.
The warm and long summer could not have come at a worse time for the catering business and the weather will be in charge of saying whether the temperate temperatures experienced during August will provide the much-needed respite for the sector."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including the new openings, was 2.7 percent during July, reflecting the slowdown in brand launches.
The Coffer Peach Tracker Industry sales indicator for the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with combined profits of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is considered the industry benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that hide from their parents
One in five children (some as young as 11) have secret social media accounts that hide their parents and teachers, according to a survey.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the number of pages of “Fake Insta”
This news caused an increase in the fear of sexual content being published.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "main" account to show their parents.
One in five children (some as young as 11) are creating social media accounts that keep adults secret.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fake Instagram accounts (referring to the social photo-sharing network Instagram).
This news has led to an increase in fear of sexual content being published.
Twenty percent of the students said they used a softened "main" account to show their parents while they had other private ones.
A mother who ran into the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenage girl who asked to be “raped.”
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of boys and girls aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: “It’s alarming that there are so many teens who are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the council of the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Council of the Scottish Athletics Federation as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is the most award-winning Scottish athlete and President Ian Beattie has defined this decision as an excellent opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from his extensive experience internationally over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys tremendous respect within the Scottish community, the UK and globally, and we are confident that Scottish athletics will greatly benefit from his incorporation into the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am very much looking forward to being a spokesperson for the athletes and I hope to be able to contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics among a total of four Olympic gold medalists and currently works as a regular commentator for the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that prevented her from walking.
He wrote on Twitter: “I had an apoplexy a month ago.
I could not walk.
The doctors said that only time could determine if I could recover and to what degree.
It was an exhausting job, but I managed to recover completely, I learned to walk again and I am currently doing agility exercises.
Thank you for your messages of encouragement.”
An advertisement of a breast milk extractor comparing women with cows divides public opinion in the networks
A breast milk extractor company has shared public opinion on the networks with an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers with cows they are wetting.
To announce the launch of the so-called "world's first silent portable breast milk extractor", the company Elvie has released an ironic announcement in the style of a music video to demonstrate the freedom that the new breast milk extractor offers to mothers.
Four royal mothers dance in a barn full of ugly cows to the tune of a song with lyrics like “Yes, I moved myself, but I don’t have glue” and “Because if you don’t notice, they’re not ugly, they’re my boobs.”
The chorus continues, “Moose, moose, I’m feeding the babies, moose, moose, I’m wetting my friends.”
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked controversy on the networks.
With 77,000 reproductions and hundreds of comments, the video provoked different reactions among viewers. Many of them claimed that this manifests the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
"Using cows to advertise this product was a very mediocre decision.
“Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, but in your case we stole their children days after giving birth.”
The Elvie milk extractor can be placed discreetly inside a maternal subject (Elvie/mother)
Another spectator commented: "Clearly traumatic for the mother and baby.
But why don’t they use it to advertise a milk extractor for mothers who are left with their babies?”
Another spectator added: "What an advertisement with so little touch."
Other viewers defended the announcement, including a woman who claimed the song seemed "very funny".
“I think it’s a great idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I would buy one.
Getting my milk out made me feel exactly like a cow.
It’s a bit of a joke, but I take it as a joke.
“It’s a great product,” he wrote.
Another commented: "This is a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who extract their milk (often in their workplaces or bathrooms) and feel like 'cows'.
This is not an advertisement to praise or judge the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, this group of women reveals that they were dancing with the discreet extractors inserted into their subjects.
The concept behind the campaign is that many women who extract their milk claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie milk extractor is completely silent, has no cables or tubes, and can be discreetly fitted into a mother's fastener, which gives women freedom to move, fasten their babies and even go out while they are extracting their milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director of Mother commented: “Elvie extractor is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
In describing the parallel between women and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milk extraction and all the challenges it entails while demonstrating in an entertaining way and close to the incredible sense of freedom that the new extractor will offer.
This is not the first time Elvie has taken over the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two creatures paraded on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have quietly moved to a camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained increased despite the fact that the monthly number of border crossings remained relatively unchanged, in part due to the stringent rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration that made it difficult to allocate godparents for the children.
Traditionally, most of the godparents were also undocumented immigrants and were afraid to jeopardize their ability to stay in the country by taking a step forward to claim a child.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential godparents and other adult members of their households would have to send their fingerprints and that that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, testified before Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no criminal record.
“About 80% of the people who are godparents or who are part of their households are in the country illegally, and a large part of these are foreigners who have committed crimes.
Therefore, we will continue to pursue these individuals,” Mr. Albence said.
In order to prosecute the children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that will require any of them to appear in court before a month has elapsed since their detention instead of 60 days, which was the previous rule, according to the shelter workers.
Many will appear by video conferencing instead of in person to try to legalize their case in front of an immigration judge.
Those who do not meet the requirements to receive assistance will be expelled quickly.
The longer they remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent snatches or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and system reports published over the past few months.
Lawyers have claimed that these fears increase in larger centers such as Tornillo, in which there is a greater likelihood that the symptoms that a child is going through will go unnoticed due to their size.
They also added that moving children to the camping area without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could be a trauma that many continue to suffer.
Syria urges U.S., French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, addressing the UN General Assembly, also urged Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war in the country is currently in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the post of Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces were found on Syrian soil illegally, on the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would "take care of them in the timely manner".
“They must withdraw immediately and without conditions,” he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have had to flee their homes.
“Damascus will continue to fight this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories of terrorist groups and of any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said they were given the right conditions for their return and blamed "some Western countries" for the "dissemination of irrational fears" that caused the refugees not to return.
“We appeal to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a mere humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not offer reconstruction aid to Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone at the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has allowed political talks to continue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale assault by Russian-backed Syrian troops in the province, which is home to three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military actions would be targeted by the jihadists, including soldiers from the al-Nusra front linked to al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and to facilitate the holding of elections.
Moualem set out the conditions to ensure the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the agency's work should be limited to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and warned of possible interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
Following that logic, Mr. Trump would get re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberals will be waiting, impeachment and scandals end his presidency prematurely.
It would be "the most dramatic end of a presidency."
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue among the observers.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have doubled to 1.05 million viewers on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, an increase of 1.7 million compared to four years ago according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" program led the cable audience ratings with 3.5 million viewers during the nights when important news occurred.
“It’s like a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, showrunner of the drama for ABC’s Designated Survivor, which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election?
The driver told him that he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? he asked.
“He said, ‘Because you make me laugh,’” Mrs. Scovell said.
There is entertainment within the chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else that appears on television, the plots that emerge from Washington can determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, whether migrant families can reunite and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting from reality is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Still, suppose something that goes beyond being an informed citizen to spend six hours watching a panel of experts debate on Bob Woodward's use of "anonymous" sources for his book "Fear," the $15,000 ostrich-skin bomber jacket by Paul Manafort ("a garment full of arrogance," the Washington Post said).
I won’t look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what makes it look like a reality show is that it's giving you something new every night," commented Brent Montgomery, senior executive at Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars," a space that deals with the changes in the characters and the daily twists and turns of Trump's show (the conflict with N.F.L.

When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny and a temperature of 26 degrees outside the house on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked in the house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He was unable to disengage while Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging from a thread.
“I remember when we were doing all those crazy programs at the time and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.”

The foreign money comes to the masses to fund the candidatures to the House for the elections of the half of the legislature
It is not surprising that the 17th congressional district of Pennsylvania is receiving a large cash flow due to the reorganization of a congressional district with two representatives in office in the race to occupy the same position.
This newly reorganized district outside of Pittsburg is represented by Democratic candidate Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election held last spring.
Lamb presents himself against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th District of Pennsylvania, which is largely superimposed on the new 17th District.
The maps were reorganized after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that Republicans manipulated the constituency of the old districts in their favor.
The electoral career in the new 17th congressional district unleashed a festival of campaign finance between the main financial arms of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee of the Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after achieving an adjusted victory in the March special elections for the 18th Pennsylvania congressional district, which enjoyed wide following.
That position was held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Politicians give Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States assessed the possibility of punishing The Savior for his support of China, and then pushed back.
Diplomats warned that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a pleasant meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and even owned a hotel in Panama until his partners pitched in to the Trump Organization’s management team.
State Department officials have decided to order the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in O Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "for recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman, in a statement earlier this month.
However, only the possibility of imposing sanctions on El Salvador, which received approximately $140 million in U.S. aid during 2017, including to control drug trafficking, development and economic aid, was disputed.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, would prove very negative for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, U.S. and Central American officials delayed holding a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent people from migrating to the United States.
But in mid-September, important administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward, effectively putting an end to any possibility of imposing sanctions on O Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to address the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, a symptom of the importance the administration attaches to it, the diplomats said.
The three U.S. envoys discreetly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new message or harsh punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about the internal deliberations whenever and whenever the anonymity of the participants was maintained.
His accounts were corroborated by an outside analyst close to the administration and he also agreed to speak whenever his anonymity was retained.
Studying History
The next negative case could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Mr. Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, of which there is currently abundant evidence in the public record.
“Mr. Mueller is also conducting his investigation to find out if Mr. Trump’s campaign conspired with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will be held accountable to that body, just when he has to prepare for the election, and he may finally have to face a popular jury.
There are many unknowns and I don’t want to suggest that Mr. Trump’s downfall is inevitable, as are his European counterparts.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the battle.
In 1938, German officers were determined to give a coup d'état against Hitler if the Western Front resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacres that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points, and the inexorable advance of democracy is accelerated or reversed.
Americans are facing several of these turning points at the moment.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been carrying the water to his neck since this newspaper reported that last year it suggested secretly recording the president and speculated that he was incapacitated for office.
Mr. Rosenstein stated that The Times' information is not true.
“How are we going to respond if the investigation just requested by the FBI into Brett Kavanaugh is not completed or impartial, or if his appointment to the Supreme Court is confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And, above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that demands responsibility from Mr. Trump?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will be subjected to a long winter.
But I don’t think we will fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that also occupied my home, which was known to the embassy.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to arrest Shabbat candids on that table that included a swastika.
With that legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?”

Rangers player Graham Dorrans is optimistic about the match against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers receive the Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a victory against the Austrians, after the impressive draw achieved in Spain against Villarreal this same month, would put them in a very favorable position to qualify in Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from debuting this season until the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard to achieve more important things.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
“We went into the game believing that we could get something positive and we reached a point.
We had the opportunity to win in the end, but in general, the draw is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but in the second we were better.
Next Thursday will be another great European night.
We hope to be able to reach the three points, but it will be difficult, because they achieved a good result in their last game, but with the support of our audience, I am sure we can fight to get a positive result.
“Last year was tough between everything that has happened to my injuries and the changes that have taken place in the team, but there is an excellent environment right now.
The team is good, the boys are having a good time and the training is good.
We look forward to fighting, forgetting last season and succeeding.”
Women Are Worried About Their Retirement Savings
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey were clear about how they wanted to be cared for, few people spoke to their family about the matter.
About half of the participants in this study conducted by Nationwide stated that they commented with their partners on the cost of prolonged care.
Only 10 percent said they would talk to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of her, but they’re not taking the necessary steps to have that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance department.
You can start with the following.
Talk to your partner and children: You can’t prepare your family to care for you if you don’t communicate your wishes well in advance.
Collaborate with your counselor and your family to figure out where and how to receive care, as those decisions can be a determining factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Among the options for financing long-term care are a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash value hybrid life insurance policy to help cover these expenses, or self-insurance covered with your own funds, whenever you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: Avoid legal battles.
Get a health care representative to appoint a trusted person to supervise your health care and make sure that professionals fulfill your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
You should also consider signing a notarial power to manage your finances.
You will need to choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure that your bills are paid if you are incapacitated.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your older father or mother has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about your medications and allergies?
Write down this information in detail in a written plan to be prepared.
"Not only is the financial issue at stake, but who are the doctors who care for it?" asked Martin.
“What medications are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?

Man Shot With Compressed Air Rifle in Ilfracombe
A man received multiple shots with a compressed air rifle as he walked back home after leaving at night.
The 40-year-old victim was found in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The agents described the shooting, which occurred at approximately 2:30 a.m. (British summer time) as a "random act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries are not serious and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
A powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to official sources, killed at least 384 people, a figure expected to continue to rise.
Due to the cut-off of communications, rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-degree earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Below we provide you with some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the Central Celebes province, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with a population of approximately 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency found along more than 300 km of coastline northwest of the island of Celebes.
This regency, an administrative region less than a province, had an approximate population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the Central Celebes province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also affected the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Rim of high seismic activity, so it suffers earthquakes regularly.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have suffered in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them, in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that devastated the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck the Mentawai Islands, located in front of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and caused the deaths of approximately 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake affected the Regency of Pidie Jaya, located in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people recalled the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami occurred on this occasion, but more than 100 people died due to the collapse of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, a 29-year-old native of Wasilla, Alaska, has been arrested on suspicion of a domestic violence crime, of preventing the filing of a complaint for domestic violence and for resistance to authority, according to a note published by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, they took her phone.
Palin remains in pretrial detention at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with a $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, in which he declared himself "not guilty, since then" when asked, the prison reported.
Palin faces three minor Type A crimes, which means he could go to jail for up to a year and receive a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Type B misdemeanor, punishable by a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska War Veterans Tribunal.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, for preventing the filing of a complaint for domestic violence and for possession of weapons in a drunken state in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior to the PTSD she suffers from after serving with the army in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia kill hundreds
At least 384 people were killed in the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not available, and the death toll is expected to increase over the course of days.
The quake occurred just opposite Célebes Central, in the northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos are circulated through the social networks in which the moment of impact is shown.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a festival on the beach of the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek to apply a rarely-implemented death penalty to suspected terrorist attacker in New York
New York federal prosecutors are trying to impose the death penalty on Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terror attack that killed eight people, a punishment that has not been applied in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane on Lower Manhattan's West Side Highway, tracking the lives of pedestrians and cyclists he found on his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and caused them serious injuries "intentionally", according to the notification of the intention to apply for the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both offences involve the possibility of applying the death penalty in accordance with the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury presented Saipov with an indictment of 22 crimes, including eight murder crimes in collaboration with an organized crime group, a practice commonly used by tax collectors in organized crime cases, and a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "notable planning and premeditation," prosecutors said, describing how Saipov carried out the "cruel, cruel and depraved" attack.
"Sayful Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco" according to the notification of intent.
Five of the victims were Argentinian tourists.
For a decade, the Southern District of New York has not prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but was finally sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a New York federal case was in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a marriage that was executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no regrets during the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that in order to carry out the attack, he was inspired by the videos of ISIS that he viewed on his phone according to the indictment.
He also asked to be able to see the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal attorneys charged with representing Saipov, said he was "obviously disappointed" with the indictment's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a life sentence without the possibility of revocation will only prolong the trauma caused by these events for all people involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
A Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be put in front of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize an army of people" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians had to "feel the pressure" of Eurosceptics (when one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested she should handle negotiations with the EU).
Ordinary MP Peter Bone told the Birmingham rally that the UK “would have already left” the EU if Mr Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Mrs. May faces to reconcile her party’s divided ranks came to light when she joined the Tories in favor of staying in the EU in an independent protest against Brexit held in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep the commitments of her Chequers plan amid attacks by Brexit supporters, opponents and the EU.
His allies insisted that he continue to fight to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the negative response, to force eurosceptics and Labour to choose between his plan and chaos.
Mr. Bone stated in the concentration of the Leave Means Leave movement of Solihull that he wanted to end Chequers' plan.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been counted on to assume responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been given the job, we would already be out of the EU at the moment,” he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: “I will continue to defend Brexit, but we must abort Chequers’ plan.”
He said: “We do not fight world wars to be served.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bone denied the suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely false.”
Andrea Jenkyns, a member of the Tories and a Brexit party, also attended the march, from which she told reporters: “The only thing I say is: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Chequers plan is not popular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular between our party and our activists who, to begin with, are the ones who occupy the streets and allow us to be elected.
Cancel the Chequers plan and start listening.”
In a message to Mrs. May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Mr Farage said in the rally that it is necessary to make politicians “feel uncomfortable” if they intend to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“Currently this is a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray the Brexit decision and we’re here today to tell them we’re not going to let them get away with it.”
In a message to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray the Brexit decision, feel uncomfortable.
“We are mobilizing the army of people from this country who gave us the victory in Brexit and who will not rest until we become a proud, independent and autonomous United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, supporters of staying in the EU marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour concentration in the city centre.
A few activists waved banners with the message Tories Against Brexit after the group launched this weekend.
Labour leader Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they suffered in an application of the party at the start of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can have IT systems in order and all the best technology for Canada, to have a frictionless border, to enjoy a free market without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“This is an absolute farce.
The concept of a good Brexit does not exist,” he added.
Warren plans to think seriously or run for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will seriously consider her candidacy for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future Saturday during a town hall session in a township in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been the focus of speculation that places her as Trump’s successor in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with his constituents using the city council format since Trump took office.
An assistant asked him if he planned to introduce himself to the president.
Warren said, “It’s time for women to go to Washington to fix the problems of our government, and for that to fail a woman in the presidency.”
An arrest has been made in connection with the deadly shooting of Sims, the LSU player.
Baton Rouge police announced Saturday that a suspect was arrested for the murder of Wayde Sims, the LSU basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson in a press round held at 11:00 (Eastern Time).
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday asking for help identifying a man who was coming out in the pictures.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the Southern University campus in the early hours of Friday.
“Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died as a result of this,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday via 247sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being present at the scene with a gun and admitted to shooting the Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish police department.
Sims, a 2-metre-old boy who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starters last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title thanks to team orders, which allowed him to reach the victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' team orders would be decisive in the race.
Bottas, who was starting from the pole, had a good start and almost left Hamilton alone while defending his position during the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel boxed first and let Hamilton run with traffic in the back of the group, which would be decisive.
The Mercedes stopped in pits one lap later and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced it after several wheel-to-wheel maneuvers that caused the Ferrari driver to unwittingly leave the interior at risk of being delayed after a double defensive maneuver in the third corner.
Max Verstappen left from the last row of the exit grid and climbed back to seventh place at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led the race for a large part of this thanks to the fact that he kept his tyres to be able to go faster in the final part and advance Kimi Raikkonen by the fourth position.
He finally boxed on lap 44 but was unable to advance any position in the last eight laps, which ended with Raikkonen in fourth place.
It was a difficult day, because Valtteri did an excellent job throughout the weekend and was a true gentleman.
The team did an extraordinary job to get the first two places,” Hamilton said.
Unsuitable body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein in an act held on Saturday for her insistence that she had not leaked Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
In a speech at an event in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of Ford’s testimony in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee and commented instead that what was happening in the Senate demonstrated that the people were “miserable, disgusting and lying.”
“The only thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing that is happening in the last days in the Senate, when you see the outrage, when you see the people who are angry and who are miserable, disgusting and lying,” he said.
“When you see these posts and leaks and they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't go."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you had a leak?
Remember your answer... did you filter the document?: "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no.
I didn't go.
Wait a minute.
“No,” he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein sent him the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh made by Ford in July and leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn’t filter out her story,” Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill newspaper.
“I asked you to keep your confidentiality and I did what you asked me to do.”
But his denial did not seem to sit well with the president, who commented the following during the Saturday night act: “I tell you that body language was not the right one.
I may not have filtered it, but it used the worst body language I’ve ever seen in my life.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats were using the charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
They are evil and disgusting, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to regain power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars fixed the loss suffered on Friday in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning the game back 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants gained an early lead with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied for the local team before Dwyer re-established the Giants' advantage.
Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen allowed them to win.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who managed to climb back up to win the Dundee 2-1 at Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth game of the season between the two teams, with a balance of the previous three victories for the Giants.
Dwyer's initial goal came in the 3:35 minute thanks to an assist from Kendall McFaull, and the second came four minutes later from Beauvillier after assistance from David Rutherford.
In a hectic initial period, Sullivan again put the local team into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt assisted Cownie to score the draw goal at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants advanced on the score before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard tied the match again with a goal via power play in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen advance to Dundee for the first time in the game at the end of the second period and secured the win by scoring their team's fifth goal in the last half of the period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play their next game at home at Milton Keynes on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds of passengers on a plane can escape an earthquake.
An Indonesian air traffic controller considered a hero after dying to make sure a plane loaded with hundreds of passengers could safely take off.
The death toll stands at 800 and many are missing after a major earthquake rocked the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to be felt in the area and many people are trapped under the pebbles of the city of Palu.
Although his co-workers fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the violently rocking Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport control tower.
He stayed at his post to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He then jumped from the control tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to take you to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Breathe our hearts when we find out,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could be in the thousands and the country's disaster management agency has said access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The death toll is believed to continue to rise because there are many bodies under the gravels and many of them could not be reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency’s spokesman.
Waves of up to six meters devastated Palu, where a massive funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are carrying aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance is bringing bodies.
Drinking water is scarce.
People are plundering the mini-markets.”
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they’re going to find there.
It’s a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" she told CNN.
Indonesia suffered earthquakes in Lombok earlier this year that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini Says One Missing After Plane Crash in a Lake in Micronesia
The airline that operates a flight that crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims that there is a missing person after previously claiming that the 47 passengers and crew had left without incident the plane that was sinking.
Air Niugini said in a statement that they had not been able to locate a passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his or her age or nationality.
Boats from the area helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed against the water as it attempted to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all stable.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events continue to be unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy confirmed that the plane landed in the lagoon before reaching the runway.
Some witnesses claim that the plane went from far to the runway.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger of American nationality, commented that he entered with very little height.
"That's an extremely positive thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said both he and other passengers managed to advance between the water reaching their waists to the emergency exits of the plane that was sinking.
He also recalled that the flight attendants were screaming and frightened, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy indicated that sailors working near the site on pier improvement tasks also helped in the rescue using an inflatable boat to move people to the coast before the plane sank about 30 meters.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in recorded airline accidents in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none have affected Air Niugini.
An analyst composes the chronology of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor's office referred to the evidence on Saturday in a repeat trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
During the trial he described to the jury how he used cell phone records to recompile the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of his death.
Rowlett stated that he had received location data from several mobile phones showing that Tellis met Chambers the night of his death contradicting his previous claims, according to The Clarion Ledger newspaper.
When this data showed that his mobile phone was with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak with Sanford.
Sanford took to the podium on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he stated that he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he was "lieing, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks at the time of his death.
Mobile phone records indicated that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett stated that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“She’s drunk on her life,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final claims on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would be seen by the jury on the same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative perception of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, a Bristol group, claims that hip hop has moved away from its origins with political messages and struggles against social problems.
They want to get back to their roots and get combative hip hop back to being popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common recently experienced a resurgence in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York City Child Caregiver Demands Couple After ‘Racist’ Message
A New York babysitter will sue a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message that was not addressed to her from the mother in which she complained she was "another black".
The couple denies being racist and compares the demand with “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her anguish at discovering that child caregiver Giselle Maurice was black when she presented her first day at work in 2016.
“NOOOOOOOOOOOON, OTHER BLACK,” Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After realizing her mistake, an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, claiming that the caregiver who had just left, who was African-American, had done her job wrong and that she was expecting a Filipina according to the New York Post announcement.
Ms. Maurice was paid on the day of work and sent home on an Uber.
Now Maurice is going to sue the couple for compensation for dismissal and demands a compensation of $350 per day for the six months of internal work for those who had been initially hired even though there was no middle contract.
“Look, I want to show you that those things don’t happen,” he told the Post on Friday, adding later, “It’s a case of discrimination.”
The couple responded to accusations of racism by saying that firing Maurice was the most reasonable, as they were afraid they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
"My wife sent him a message that I had no intention of sending him.
It's not racist.
We are not racist,” her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would they leave their children in the hands of a person they offended, even if it was because of a mistake?
Is your baby just born?
Come on!"
After comparing the lawsuit to a "extortion," Plasco stated that his wife had just given birth to a two-month-old baby and that she was in a "very difficult situation."
“Did you go for someone like that?
That’s not very ethical,” added the investment banker.
As the legal process continues, the court quickly denounced the couple on social media, attacking them for their behavior and applied logic.
Paddington’s editors feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear as soon as a new letter could be concluded.
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of a person who reads it for the first time before it was published.
It’s really fun to know now what we know about Paddington’s huge success.”
After claiming that his father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book about a small toy bear, would be optimistic that his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "bitter" after his death last year.
From Paddington, to what he describes as a "very important member of our family", he added that his father was discreetly proud of the success he eventually achieved.
“He was a quiet man and nothing presumptuous,” he said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who gets something: you’re proud even though you didn’t really do it.
I think I felt Paddington's success a little bit like that.
Although it was his creation and the product of his imagination, he always gave Paddington his full credit."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors unsuccessfully worked to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that he was very bad, that he was not expected to survive.
“So I got Nad’s call to tell me I was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'll meet you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors gave her to keep her heart beating were slowly being consumed and leaving her body.
He had died before, and now he was dying.
I just had to sit back and wait, knowing what was going on.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I had to hold on.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, at that moment struggling for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with the other passengers, without noticing the ordeal she was suffering.
"Nobody detected him," he said.
“I had my head down and I was crying all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this impressive sense of solidarity for Nad.
I needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her.”
Postcards of afflicted women to avoid suicides on a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones due to suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a Welsh bridge with messages of inspiration and phone numbers they can call for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, and committed suicide at 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel like I have to feel every day,” he said.
Mrs Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that their smile lit up any room.”
However, he quit his job before he died and was "in a very deep depression".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis commented, “I have a continuing concern that a side effect will occur.”
Ms. Davis created the cards "to inform people that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if you are a friend.
“Don’t be silent, you need to speak.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost her partner Mark for 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't tell me he was sad or depressed or anything like that," she said.
“A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
Christmas Day touched the bottom (when the children opened their gifts, he made no eye contact with them or anything)."
He claimed that his death was a huge trauma for them, but they must overcome it: "He tore the family apart.
Destroyed us.
But we have to go ahead and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on a wire as FBI investigates
"I thought that if we could get something like what I was asking for (a limited time and limited scope of investigation), we might get a little unity," Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "erasing out" due to the paralysis of supporters.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to conduct the investigation?
His reluctance is due to a matter of time.
There are five weeks left before the midterm elections (November 6th). If, as expected, Republicans get poor results, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush was calling for senators, putting pressure on them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, thanks to whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen when the FBI carries out your report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the tie and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of defectors in North Korea has fallen under Kim's mandate.
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong Un's rise to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea's unification ministry, said there were 1,127 desertions last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in tariffs charged by people crossing the border were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean deserters are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them flow through China, which has the largest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them.
Relations between the north and the south (which technically continue in war) have improved markedly over the past few months.
That same month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons that were parked.
This came after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, in which they agreed to work closely to eliminate nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
“If we don’t have confidence in the United States, we won’t be able to rely on our national security, and under these circumstances, there’s no chance that we will unilaterally disarm first,” Mr. Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's not fit to go to the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was not fit by nature to access the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman ever behaved that way, she would be called hysterical," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of sexual abuse against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as a teenager.
During the initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, on occasion almost screaming and staying talking while describing his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the committee’s Democrats, cataloguing the accusations against him as a “grosque and coordinated reputation murder” organized by liberals angered by Hillary Clinton’s defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi stated that he believed Kavanaugh's statement demonstrated that he could not access the Supreme Court because it demonstrated that he had prejudice against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he attacked Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi objected when asked if he would attempt to challenge Kavanaugh if he is confirmed in office and if the Democrats get a majority in the House.
“What I have to say is this: if you’re not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then you’re not fit to be in not just the Supreme Court, but in the court you’re currently in,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Washington D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about possible resolutions that Kavanaugh could pass against the Patient Protection and Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as she is considered a conservative judge.
In the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh shunned questions about whether certain Supreme Court decisions would be overturned.
"This is not the time for a hysterical and prejudiced person to go to court and still wait for us to say, 'Look how good!'"
Women need to exercise it.
It is a justifiable diatribe, months and years of rage overflowing, and it cannot be expelled without weeping.
“We cry when we get angry,” said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s that weird, right?”
He continued: "I got a lot of help from a woman who was executive somewhere, who said she was also crying when she was angry, but that she developed a technique that was that when she was angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, 'You're probably thinking I'm crying because I'm sad.
But I'm angry."
And then, it continued.
I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as an escape valve for anger in part because they are essentially not understood.
One of my sharpest memories in one of my first jobs in a male-dominated office, where I began to cry with an indignation impossible to describe, was that an older woman grabbed me from behind my neck, a distant superior who had always caused me a slight fear, and drove me to the hole of the stairs.
“Never let them see you crying,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll comfort you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on her presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught on an out-of-marriage adventure on a boat named Monkey Business and retired from the presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought there was no reason why she could not consider running for president.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” I laughed 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates in the race and the last one they needed was another.
They called it “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
Because the campaign was advanced, he was lagging behind in fundraising, so he swore he would not enter the race for the presidency unless he managed to raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters contributed $1,000 to the male candidates would only contribute $250.
“What do you think, I have a discount?” he asked.
When she made her speech to announce that she would not present a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed by the emotions (of gratitude to the people who supported her, of frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise money and address voters instead of delegates, and of anger at existing sexism) that went speechless.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalled how the press reacted to her.
“You would think Kleenex was my sponsoring company.
I remember thinking, what are you going to write on my gravestone?
"Chorus?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could turn out to be positive for Beijing
The initial bombings of the U.S.-China trade war have been deafening, and although the war is far from over, a distance between the countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year recording key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with the imposition of new tariffs that affect the equivalent of $200,000 million, recording half of the items coming to the United States from China.
Beijing counterattacked each time in the same way, the most recent raising tariffs from five to ten percent on $60,000 million in U.S. goods.
China has vowed to mimic U.S. measures and it seems unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will remain unchanged in the short term.
To get Washington to back down, it would be necessary to yield to its demands, but to bend publicly to the United States would be much more embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say that if Beijing knows how to play its cards correctly, the pressures of the trade war with the United States could favor China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions necessary to start an economic crisis in both countries is actually far more dangerous than previously recognized,” said Abigail Grace, an Asia-centric researcher at the Center for New American Security.
Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country devastated by a war of more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem declared that the country's conditions are improving.
“Today the situation on the ground is much more stable and safe thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All the necessary conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods are now being given.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
A further six million people continue to live in the country and need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would appreciate the help it can receive to rebuild a country that is devastated.
But he said he would not accept conditional aid from countries supporting the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National club located outside of Paris, France.
It is the sixth consecutive U.S. defeat on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who was the most battle he offered during the tournament, sent the ball into the water in hole 16 of par 3, losing his match against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer shone in all his series, becoming one of only four players to score a 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament was implemented in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the worst-ranked player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, of Denmark.
The world's first-place finisher, Dustin Johnson, lost 2&1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran with eight Ryder Cups played, Spaniard Sergio Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a became the European player with the most tournament victories, with 25.5 points.
"I don't cry often, but today I can't help it.
It was a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for selecting me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to be able to get the cup back.
The important thing is the team, and I'm happy to have been able to help," said an excited Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a after the European victory.
He passed the testimony to his compatriot John Ram, who managed to defeat American golf legend Tiger Woods by 2&1 in Sunday's singles game.
"It's incredible how proud I am today to have defeated Tiger Woods. I grew up watching that boy play," said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost his four games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
This is a strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, winner of 14 majors, located just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend to keep out of the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high-calibre golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team's frustrating performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, for a moment, they put the Europeans in trouble.
We're fighting.
I took my hat off to Thomas.
He is an excellent captain.
The 12 players played very well.
We will reorganize, I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will go ahead.
I want these 12 boys and I'm proud to be captain.
