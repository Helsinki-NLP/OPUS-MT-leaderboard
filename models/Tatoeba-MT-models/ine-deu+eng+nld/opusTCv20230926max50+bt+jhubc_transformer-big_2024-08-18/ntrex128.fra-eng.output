Members of the Assembly of Wales worried about "pretend to be puppets"
Welsh voters are appalled by a proposal to replace their title with the acronym MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal stems from the proposal to change the name of the assembly, which would become the Welsh Parliament.
In the political sphere, members of the Assembly believe that this could be ridiculed.
A Labour official said his group was concerned that the acronym “rhymes with Twp and Pwp”.
For non-Wales readers: in Welsh, twp means stupid, and pwp means crotch.
According to one of its members, Plaid Cymru (Party of Wales) is not "satisfied" and has proposed other formulas.
The Conservative party would be "open" to a name change, but noted that the distance between MWP and Muppet is narrow.
In this context, in Welsh, the letter w is pronounced as the English letter u of the Yorkshire region.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing legislation introducing the name change, said that "the final decision on the names of the members of the Assembly rests with the members of the Assembly".
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 (Government of Wales Act of 2017) gives the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal to designate the Assembly as the Welsh Parliament, which was also widely supported.
On the question of the title of members, the Commission favours Members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP); however, a large majority of Welsh people prefer MWP.
It seems that members of the Assembly are making other suggestions, but the effort to reach consensus could prove a real puzzle for Elin Jones, the Speaker of the Assembly, who is expected to submit a bill on name change in the coming weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes to the functioning of the Assembly, including rules on the exclusion of members and the design of the committee system.
The members of the Assembly will make the final decision on the name issue during the debates on the bill.
Macedonia: referendum on changing the name of the country
Macedonians will decide on Sunday whether their country should now be called the “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute between the country and its Greek neighbor, for whom Macedonia is the name of one of its provinces.
For a long time, Athens has insisted that the name of Macedonia constitutes a claim on its territory and has repeatedly vetoed the accession of its neighbouring country to the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opposed to the referendum, said he would not take the results into account.
However, supporters such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev maintain that the name change is only a small price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
Harlem: Churches in trouble, Saint Martin bells silenced
“The elderly people I spoke with say that traditionally, there was a bar and a church on every street corner,” Adams said.
“There are no more of them today.”
According to him, it is normal that the bars have become scarce.
Today, “we no longer meet in the same way,” he explains.
“We used to go to a bar like our neighbor’s, but that’s not the case anymore.”
As for the churches, the funds from the sale of buildings will run out long before what the officials imagine and this concerns him: "Sooner or later, they will return to the starting box".
He adds that the churches could be replaced by condominium complexes, inhabited by individuals who will not help maintain the last shrines in the neighborhood.
“The people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will largely be whites who will rush the closure of all the churches, because they are unlikely to become members of them,” he worries.
Before Harlem became a black metropolis, white congregations built the two churches: Metropolitan Community in 1870, and Saint Martin 10 years later.
The original white Methodist congregation abandoned the place in the 1930s.
A black congregation, who were preaching nearby, took possession of the building.
The church of St. Martin was taken over by a black community under the leadership of the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who initiated a boycott of the shops on 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, in which Blacks struggled to get employed or to get a promotion.
In 1939, a fire ravaged the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners were preparing to rebuild and ordered a new carillon,
Father Johnson’s son and successor to the Church of St. Martin, Reverend David Johnson, proudly called the “poor people’s bells.”
Tiffany Ng (University of Michigan), the professional who played it in July, gave it a completely different name: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”.
She also mentions that this is the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who, 18 years ago, took place in front of the largest carillon of the Riverside church.
Mr. Merriweather claims that Saint Martin did not replace him.
In recent months, there has been much talk of the upheaval of architects and entrepreneurs, provoked by the secular elite of the church on the one hand, and the episcopal diocese on the other.
In July, the parish council, a governing body composed of lay officials, informed the diocese that it was concerned that the latter would impose on it the costs incurred, even though it did not participate in the recruitment of professionals.
Some parishioners deplored the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
California: 13-Year-Old Boy Wounded by Shark at Lobster Fishing Game
According to authorities, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy last Saturday while fishing for lobster in California on the opening day of the season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV that he had been diving with friends for half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and started paddling up to him to get him out of the water.
At first, Chad thought that the young boy was screaming for joy at having a catch, then he realized that in reality he was having a fight.
He had been bitten.
As he approached the young man, Hammel noticed that he had an open fracture of the collarbone.
“I was screaming for everyone to get out of the water: There’s a shark!” Chad said.
The boy was evacuated to Rady Children Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in critical condition.
The species of shark that caused the attack is not known.
At a press conference, rescue chief Larry Giles reported that a shark had been spotted a few weeks earlier, but that it was not a dangerous species.
He added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities closed access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours to conduct an investigation and for security reasons.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 species of sharks, but that most are considered non-hazardous.
Sainsbury's offensive plans in the British aesthetics market
Sainsbury's is handmade on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and provides them with rays similar to those of supermarket, filled with aesthetic and cosmetic products and managed by specialists in the field.
As part of a major breakthrough in the UK aesthetics market of 2.8 billion pounds, which continues to grow as sales of fashion and home items are falling, wider beauty product rays will be tested in 11 stores and applied to others if the experience proves conclusive.
Supermarkets are now investing in the beauty market in order to reuse the space previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and other household items.
Sainsbury’s said it would increase the volume of its offerings to 3,000 cosmetic items, which will include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space in sectors similar to those of stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also reviving its Boutique makeup line to offer a majority of untested products on animals, an increasingly important criterion among young consumers.
Fragrance Shop will also test concessions at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first one opened last week in Croydon, South London, and a second one scheduled to open later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Supermarket executives need to dig their heads to attract consumers, who increasingly tend to make their purchases online and head to nearby shops for everyday food products.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said the outlets will increasingly resemble large areas as the supermarket chain attempts to counter discount stores Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s has set up Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also opened the doors of several Habitat stores since the purchase of the two chains two years ago, which, according to the group, has helped drive sales of consumer goods and profitable acquisitions.
Previous attempts to restructure the rays of pharmaceutical and cosmetic items in the British chain had failed.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's attempted a partnership with Boots, but it came to an end following a controversy over the distribution of profits from pharmacies located in supermarkets.
It was after selling its 281 pharmacies for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmaceutical chain, three years ago that the new strategy was implemented.
Lloyds had to play a role in introducing a wide range of high-end skincare brands to 4 stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director of Sainsbury's, announced that the appearance of beauty product rays has been changed to improve the customer environment.
“We have also invested in trainings so that our staff can offer sound advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet any type of need and, thanks to the embellishment of our radii and the ideal situation of our establishments, our dominance of the cosmetics market is now undeniable and changes buying habits,” added Mills-Hicks.
Peter Jones's anger over Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragon's Den TV star Peter Jones is furious after he announces the withdrawal of host Holly Willoughby from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million home decor brand contract to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to take care of the Truly interior design and accessories brand.
The activity of the two protagonists was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning host announced on Instagram that she is retiring.
Holly Willoughby angered Dragon's Den star Peter Jones by stepping out of their fruitful textile and interior design business at the last minute to dedicate herself to her new exclusive contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was furious when the TV-loved child revealed at a tense meeting at the headquarters of the Dragon's Den star's commercial empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new contracts, worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, no longer allowed him to take care of their clothing and accessories.
The Truly brand was equated with that of actress Gwyneth Paltrow, Goop, and could have doubled the fortune of the hostess to an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones jumped into her private jet to join one of her secondary residences outside Britain.
According to one source, “Truly was by far one of Holly’s priorities.
It will ensure its future for the next two decades.
His decision left everyone without a voice.
No one could have imagined what was going to happen on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
Marlow’s headquarters is filled with ready-to-sell products.”
Experts believe that the departure of This Morning's host, one of Britain's most "bankable" celebrities, could cause the company to lose millions, due to significant investments in products ranging from pillows or candles to clothing or interior items, and the risk of a delayed launch.
It could also end a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, parents of 3 children, have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Holly Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016; Jones, 52, joined the group as president in March of the same year.
The couples went on vacation together and Peter Jones owns 40% of the shares in Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby is expected to become the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity program.
A source close to Jones said last night he did not want to comment on his business activities.
The debate was heated, but in the end we love each other.
Trump has ridiculed the media who criticize him because of his comment that some consider “unworthy of a president,” and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
“Why did President Trump give up so much?”
He laughed, taking a voice from a TV reporter.
“I didn’t give up anything at all.”
He said Kim Jong-un was in favour of holding a second meeting after Trump called the first, which took place in Singapore in June, a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on this denuclearization are at a dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that he saw no "corresponding response" from the United States to North Korea's first disarmament measures.
He regretted that, on the contrary, the United States continued to impose sanctions to maintain pressure.
In his rally speech, Trump offers a much more optimistic perspective.
“Everything is fine with North Korea,” the president said.
We have fought the armed conflict.
“Millions of people would have been killed.
We have an excellent relationship now.”
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have resulted in positive results: the cessation of missile tests, the release of hostages and the remains of U.S. military personnel returned to their families.
He also justified his unusual approach to relations with Kim.
“It’s so easy to play the role of president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to access this arena full of cracks, there are barely more than 200 standing in front of me,” he said.
Tsunami: Devastated Island and Hundreds Killed in Indonesia
After the earthquake that shook Lombok, the help of foreign NGOs was supposedly not necessary.
More than 10 per cent of Lombok's population has been dispersed, but no state of national disaster has been declared, a prerequisite for triggering international aid.
“Unfortunately, many times they have made it clear that they do not want international aid, which makes things a little more complicated,” Sumbung said.
While the Save the Children organization is setting up a team to travel to Palu, it still doesn't know if work on the ground will be allowed.
The spokesman for the national disaster management agency, Sutopo, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to humanitarian aid.
Despite the constant shakings, the country is cruelly lacking the means to protect itself from the whims of nature.
Refuges have been set up in Aceh, but they are rare in other coastal areas.
Although a warning was issued, no alarm sirens sounded in Palu, which probably contributed to human casualties.
Even under ideal conditions, moving from one Indonesian island to another is not an easy thing.
Natural disasters further complicate the use of transport.
A hospital ship that had been posted to Lombok to treat the victims is now en route to Palu, but it will take at least 3 days to reach the site of the new disaster.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has put devastated infrastructure reform at the centre of his election campaign and spent considerable sums to restore roads and railways.
The lack of funds, however, undermined Mr. Joko's government, called to represent himself in front of voters next year.
The Indonesian head of state is also under pressure due to the persistence of inter-ethnic tensions in the country, where members of the Islamic majority practice their faith in a more conservative way.
More than a thousand Indonesians have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been driven from their homes, amid clashes in the streets between Christians and Muslims, armed with machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Watch: Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge makes it to the draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saves a Premier League defeat to Chelsea, scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge (London).
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 30 meters away from Chelsea's goals, and his team was led from 1 to 0.
He shot into the ball on his left, before escaping a shot to the second pole.
The balloon flew above the repair surface before heading towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball eventually reaches Kepa Arrizabalaga and finishes its way to the bottom of the cage.
“I was just trying to sit down, grab the ball, but players like Shaq are always pulling as far away as possible, so I tried to save as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante approaching to control and without really thinking much I decided to shoot.”
Chelsea led 1-0 at halftime after a goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues striker kicked a pass towards Mateo Kovacic, before running to the midfield and sprinter side Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick come-and-go in the middle of the field,
Then he made a magnificent deep-shoot that led Hazard to the surface.
Hazard overtook the defense and finished his race in the second pole net, with a left-footed shot behind Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face the Neapolitans in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Indonesia: Tsunami toll rises to 832
The disaster management agency said on Sunday morning that the quake and tsunami accounted for 832 deaths.
Many residents are trapped under the rubble of buildings destroyed by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that shook the country on Friday and triggered 6-metre-high waves, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
With more than 380,000 inhabitants, the city of Palu was dotted with debris from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing a woman
A murder investigation was opened after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
At 7:55 a.m., the 44-year-old woman was found stabbed in the street John de Grayson Mews, and a 32-year-old man suspected of murder was arrested.
Police are urging residents of the neighborhood who have seen or heard something to give their testimony.
Police Captain Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation has only just begun, but I would like to ask anyone who was around John Street in Birkenhead and who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
“I call on taxi drivers, who could have picked up something on their dashcam, and ask them to provide us with any information that is crucial to our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the murdered woman was found on a Birkenhead property where she resided.
This morning, people claiming to know the woman appeared at the crime scene and asked questions about where she was discovered.
The investigation is ongoing and police said they were informing relatives close to the victim.
A taxi driver has just been denied access to his apartment in Grayson Mews, with police not allowing anyone to enter or leave the building.
The news left him speechless.
Residents have just been informed that the building would be inaccessible for several hours.
A police officer said the entire area was considered a crime scene.
A woman in tears appeared on the spot,
I repeat, “It’s too horrible.”
At 2 p.m., two police vans were stationed inside the cord, and another outside.
Several officers were monitoring the building on the inside of the cordon.
Anyone with information is requested to send a message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101, or anonymously contact Crime Failure at 0800 555 111, as indicated in Registry 247 dated September 30.
Parliament: the statue of Cromwell, the last victim of an attempt to rewrite history
Its ban would be the just return of things, in view of the acts of destruction, of England's countless religious and cultural goods, committed by its puritanical supporters, such as the fanatical Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society found Mr. Crick's proposal "unreasonable" and called it a "revisionist attempt".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “Given the current debate over the removal of statues, it was obvious that Oliver Cromwell’s standing in front of the Palace of Westminster would not be spared.
Cromwell neither ordered nor conducted the iconoclasm during the English Civil Wars.
It is likely that his person was sacrificed for the actions committed by his ancestor Thomas during the previous century.
The superb depiction of Cromwell, sculpted by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, attests to the consideration we had for him in the 19th century and belongs to the historiography of a personality that many of us still celebrate.
Mr. Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the nineteenth century than today, as an advocate of parliament against external pressures, I mean monarchy of course.
Whether this representation is accurate or not is an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict that broke out in the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a particularly recognizable figure who represents one side of the fracture.
His accomplishments as Lord Protector also deserve to be highlighted and commemorated.”
China: A pig kills a farmer
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southeast China.
Identified as Mr. Yuan, the man was found dead, the artery severed and covered with blood near a porkyard in the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to inject vaccines into pigs in a pighouse on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He was reportedly traveling with his cousin from nearby Yunnan province on Wednesday, with the aim of selling 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the nearby pork store was open.
He claims that a huge male pig was inside and that blood was flowing from his mouth.
A forensic report confirms that the animal weighing 250 kg has mutilated the breeder to death.
According to Guiyang Evening News, Mr. Wu, the breeder’s cousin, said that “his legs were crushed and covered in blood.”
Security cameras show Mr. Yuan arriving at the market at 04:40 on Thursday to feed his animals.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The pig that caused Mr. Yuan's death belonged neither to the breeder nor to his cousin.
A market official told the Evening News that the animal was locked up to avoid any other incident and allow police to gather evidence.
Mr. Yuan's family and market leaders are reportedly negotiating compensation.
Although the facts are rare, attacks by pigs against people have already been reported.
In 2016, on a farm in Massachusetts, a pig assaulted a woman and her husband, seriously injuring him.
Ten years earlier, a 295 kg pig stuck a Welsh farmer on his tractor before his wife managed to get away from him.
In 2012, when an Oregon farmer had just been devoured by his pigs, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that he was not in principle an aggressive animal, but that the taste of blood can cause this type of behavior.
“They are rather playful animals.
Very curious kids... they have no intention of hurting.
We just need to show them the respect they deserve,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa are expected to cause heavy rainfall in the southeastern United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves above the colder waters of Mexico's northeast coast.
However, Rosa will cause showers in northeastern Mexico and southwestern United States in the coming days.
The winds were 135 km/h (category 1) from 5 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday, while Rosa was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The hurricane is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression begins to form above the Pacific Ocean and circulates eastward, toward the west coast of the United States. As it approaches the Lower California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a storm, Hurricane Rosa will bring intense tropical humidity to the North, in the southeastern United States.
Up to 25 cm of rain will fall in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical humidity combined with the approaching depression will create widespread torrential rains in the southwest over the coming days.
At the local level, precipitation of between 2.5 and 10 cm will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and potential landslides in the desert.
The rainfall will reach a rate of 5 to 7.5 cm per hour in places, particularly in southern Nevada and Arizona, due to the intensity of tropical humidity.
There is expected to be between 5 and 10 cm of rain in southwestern areas, including much of Arizona.
Scattered tropical rains are likely to cause sudden flooding and rapid deterioration of conditions.
It is strongly discouraged to venture into the desert on foot due to the threat of tropical precipitation.
Heavy rains could turn the canyons into loose rivers and storms will produce wind gusts and dust swirls at places.
The approaching depression will result in abundant local rains in some southern parts of the country, on the California coast.
The total rainfall can reach more than 1.3 cm, which could cause low debris flows and make the shoe slippery.
This could be the first rains of the dry season in the region.
Scattered tropical showers will reach Arizona on Sunday at the end of the day and early Monday morning, then intensify later Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will fall on all four corners of the country on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
Significant temperature variations are expected for the month of October across the United States due to the cooling of the Arctic, but the climate of the tropics will remain warm,
This sometimes leads to a radical change in time over short distances.
The central region of the United States, which will experience significant temperature variations on Sunday, is a perfect example of this.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, or between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa), the difference is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, persistent summer heat will attempt to infiltrate and intensify again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience a hot start to October, with temperatures around 26 degrees covering the southern plains and other northeastern regions.
Mercury could reach 26 degrees in New York on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the seasonal average.
Multi-day forecasts indicate that temperatures are expected to be above average in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial attracts more than 20 million viewers
Broadcast on 6 TV channels on Thursday, the stunning hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused her of sexually assaulting her in the 1980s, were followed by more than 20 million people.
As the political deadlock persists, broadcasters have disrupted their usual Friday program to announce a setback: an agreement devised by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to allow the FBI to investigate the charges for a week.
In front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Christine Ford said she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh, under the influence of alcohol, had engaged in touching her person and had attempted to remove her clothes during a high school evening.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate tirade, claimed to be also 100% certain that this had never happened.
According to a Nielsen report, the trial is likely to have reached an audience of more than 20.4 million people.
The company calculated the number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures from other channels broadcasting the trial, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen does not always manage to estimate the number of people watching TV in the office.
By comparison, the trial attracted as many people as a football match or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose animators broadly supported Kavanaugh’s nomination, was the most watched channel on the day of the auditions, with an average of 5.69 million viewers.
ABC ranked second with an audience of 3.26 million.
CBS (3.1 million), NBC (2.94 million), MSNBC (2.89 million) and CNN (2.52 million) followed, still according to Nielsen.
The interest did not weaken once the hearing was over.
Flake was at the center of the drama that was being played on Friday.
After the moderate Republican's office released a statement saying it would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras unveiled a scene in which the senator is sidelined by protesters as he tried to take the elevator to the courtroom hearing.
Flake lowered his eyes for several minutes, while CNN re-broadcast the sequence of the interpellation live.
“Don’t look anywhere else, look at me,” one of the women said.
“Do you really think he’s telling the truth?
You hold power when so many women are poor.”
Before the elevator doors closed, Flake indicated that his office had issued a statement and would say more at the board meeting.
All cable and broadcast networks covered the session live a few hours later, as the Judiciary Committee prepared to vote on the procedure to advance Kavanaugh's nomination by the entire Senate.
Flake said, however, that a week-long investigation by the FBI should first be conducted into the allegations made against the candidate, which were demanded by minority Democrats.
Flake was partly persuaded by talking to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
He made his decision after meeting with Coons and several other senators thereafter.
His choice weighed heavily on the balance, as the Republicans would not have obtained the votes to approve Kavanaugh's appointment without a preliminary investigation.
President Trump authorized the FBI to investigate allegations of sexual assault by Brett Kavanaugh.
Britain: May accuses Brexit opponents of ‘little politics’
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union, making "little politics" at the expense of Britain's future and national interest.
May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another exchange with the newspaper, which published a photo of Theresa May on the cover, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson continued his attacks against his so-called Chequers plans, claiming that the free trade proposal between Britain and the European Union was “practically ridiculous.”
Wayde Sims: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson, Suspected of Killing LSU Player
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting that resulted in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, also 20, was stunned and charged with second-degree murder, Baton Rouge police said.
Authorities released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims had lost his glasses during the altercation.
Found at the scene of the crime, the glasses wore Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB, a subsidiary of the CBS group.
During his interrogation, Simpson confessed to the police being responsible for Wayde's death.
According to his lawyer, his bail was set at $350,000.
The office of the forensic doctor of the parish of Baton Rouge published a preliminary report on Friday, which determines that the death was caused by an injury by a bullet that crossed the head and lodged in the neck.
The police department recognizes the assistance received by the Louisiana State Fugitive Task Force, the forensic laboratory of the state police, Southern University police, as well as citizens, in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement for their “commitment and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was only 20 years old.
1.98 m for 98 kg, the player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at the LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points and made 2.6 rebounds per game in the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated and shocked" after news of Wayde's death.
“We fear this kind of event all the time,” Wade regretted.
Mexico: a volcano bursts with ashes
From the ash escaping from the volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern quarters of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Center for Disaster Prevention recommended Mexicans to move away from the volcano, after recording a peak of activity in the crater, with 183 emissions of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The center monitored several rumblings and tremors from Popocatepetl.
On social media, the images showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity at the volcano located 72 km from the capital, since an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, dubbed Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Catalonia: clashes between police and separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote
On Saturday, six arrests took place in Barcelona after clashes between independence protesters and riot police, as thousands of opponents joined in protests to mark the first anniversary of the referendum that divided Catalonia.
Before being pushed back by riot police, masked separatists threw them eggs and colored powder, creating clouds of dust in the streets, which usually do not deplete tourists.
Swarms also erupted later in the day, while police used batons to contain the clashes.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanting “neither forget nor forgive,” faced unionist supporters shouting “long life to Spain.”
Fourteen protesters with minor injuries were treated, according to local media.
A year after the referendum on October 1st, which was considered illegal by Madrid but was celebrated by Catalans in favour of separation, tensions remain in the independence region.
An overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, despite a low turnout, with opponents of the secession largely boycotting the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent Catalans from accessing polling stations in the region.
Independent groups had camped Friday night to block a demonstration in support of the national police.
It had its place, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated with his wife in the separatist demonstration, said he had no hope of independence from Catalonia.
“We have witnessed a great moment last year.
My parents were crying with joy at the idea of being able to vote, but now we are in an impasse,” he laments.
Despite their capital victory, although slim, in the regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many popular leaders being exiled or detained pending trial for holding the referendum and declaring Catalonia's independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the demonstration in support of the police on his phone, said politicians were responsible for blocking the situation, both on one side and on the other.
“Tension just goes up,” he regrets.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison awaiting trial since last year, announced his intention to run for the European Parliament elections next year.
“This is the best way for me to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression unleashed by the Spanish government,” he added.
Arrest in Londonderry: Men hit a house by car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after being repeatedly blacked out over a house in Londonderry.

Police Captain Bob Blemmings said the doors and walls were damaged.
The car was also shot with arrows.
Livingston wins the game 1-0 against the Rangers thanks to Menga
Dolly Menga's first goal secures Livingston's victory
Recently promoted, the Livingston team surprised the Rangers by imposing a second win in 18 games on Steven Gerrard, the current coach of the Ibrox club.
Menga's goal made all the difference and allowed Gary Holt's team to place in 2nd position in the standings, on an equal footing with Hibernian.
Gerrard's men are deprived of victory outside the Premiership league this season, and have to face the Hearts team on Sunday, which leads by 8 points.
But before that, the Rangers will meet the Vienna Rapid on the occasion of the Europa League on Thursday.
As for the Livingston team, she extends her unbeaten career in the division by 6 games, and her head coach Holt, who has been replacing Kenny Miller since last month, can boast that he hasn't lost a single match yet.
Livingston missed an opportunity in the face of blunt opponents
Holt's team could have taken the lead long before scoring, as their direct approach put the Rangers in difficulty.
Scott Robinson tried to pierce but was stuck in front of the opposing goal, followed by a late intervention by Alan Lithgow, on a head pass by Craig Halkett.
The Livingston team allowed the Rangers to own the ball, knowing that it could hinder them through hard-working tactics.
This is where the decisive goal came in.
The Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston attempted an opening; Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to catch Menga, who took a touch and scored a midfield goal.
At this point, the Rangers dominated the game but found themselves faced with an impenetrable defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was rarely worried.
The second half had the same pace, although Alfredo Morelos forced a stop for Kelly.
Rangers keeper Allan McGregor stopped a hit from Scott Pittman's foot, while Lithgow managed to thwart one of Livingston's plans.
The Livingston keeper repelled all attempts and protected his cage, while two penalties were refused by the referee, one for provoking Halkett directed against Glenn Middleton and the other for a misdemeanor.
Livingston's "phenomenon" - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Stunning performance and results for Livingston.
They have all been excellent and continue to exceed expectations on this upward slope.
Their style and team composition have hardly changed since their return to the top, but the credit largely goes to Holt for having since his arrival motivated a team.
which has many great players.
Captain Halkett's defense was grandiose and beautifully organized, and Menga managed to keep Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in the air for the duration of the game.
Unfortunately, the Rangers were not inspired.
Despite a good level with Gerrard, they were not up to their past talent.
They missed a last chance and only managed to break through the opposing side once; this is a warning for the Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the table.
President Erdogan's mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday, 29 September, Turkish and German leaders met around a breakfast in Berlin in a relaxed atmosphere.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
Various issues have been addressed, such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then flew to Cologne for the inauguration of one of the largest mosques.
One of the most important Turkish communities abroad lives in this city.
Calling for security reasons, the police prevented 25,000 protesters from gathering in front of the building, while many supporters were able to approach to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators, mostly Kurds, have raised their voices, condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into his country.
The split that emerges from the protests reflects Erdogan’s dual vision: a visitor welcomed as a hero by some Germans of Turkish origin and described as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies after a collision with a car
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred around 10:15 a.m. local time, near the junction between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road from Deptford to the southeast of the city.
The driver of the vehicle stopped, the rescue arrived at the scene, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The accident occurred several months after a cyclist died on Chiders Street, about 1.5 km from the accident that took place on Saturday.
London police said the officers were making every effort to identify the individual and warn his loved ones.
Roads have been closed and bus deviations have been made. It is advisable for motorists to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: 6 officers injured in riot
The head of the high-security men's prison said six prison officers had been injured in a riot.
The riot began at HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire at around 9:30 a.m. local time on Sunday and is still not under control.
Specialised anti-riot agents were sent to unblock the situation, involving 8 detainees and held in a prison wing.
On the spot, the officers were treated for minor facial injuries.
A prison management spokesperson said: “Specially trained personnel have been deployed to restore order at HMP Long Lartin Prison.
Six officers have been treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons; officials will have to answer to the police authorities and be able to see their sentences extended.”
More than 500 prisoners, including criminals considered to be the most dangerous in the country, are incarcerated in the HM Long Lartin prison.
In June, the prison director was hospitalized following an assault by a prisoner.
In October last year, riot police were sent to prison to stop a serious disturbance: prisoners had attacked staff with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa: Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City threatened by sudden floods (which could be beneficial for drought-affected areas)
It's rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that's probably what's going to happen early next week. Hurricane Rosa is heading for the southwestern desert with what's left of energy. This region could be hit by sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, with rains announcing as early as Monday evening.
The Phoenix-based National Weather Service said in a tweet that “only ten tropical cyclones have preserved the stage of depression or tropical storm over a 300-km perimeter around Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) had stopped 64 km from the Arizona border.
The latest estimates from the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 cm of precipitation, and up to 15 cm by locations in the Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other parts of the southwestern desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are expected to experience 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with total isolated measurements of up to 10 cm.
Rosa rains could be lifesaving for drought-affected areas that are not exposed to the risk of sudden flooding.
Although the risk of flooding should not be taken lightly, rain could be beneficial for the southwestern region, given the current drought situation.
“According to the U.S. drought monitoring system, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least one extreme-category drought, the second-severest category,” reports weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa begins its journey on the coasts of the Lower California Peninsula.
Still of great power on Sunday morning and generating winds up to 135 km/h, Rosa was located 620 km from Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moves north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm meets the cold waters of the Pacific and thus loses its strength.
It is expected to reach the Mexican coast with the force of a hurricane on Monday afternoon or Monday evening.
In some parts of Mexico, rainfall could be massive and could lead to a risk of flooding.
“In total, between 7.5 and 15 cm of precipitation is expected from Lower California to the northwest of Sonora and can reach up to 25 cm,” said weather.com.
Rosa will then cross Mexico northward, with the force of a tropical storm, and will reach the Arizona border on Tuesday, early in the morning, as a tropical depression. She will cross Arizona and southern Utah on Tuesday evening.
“Torrential rains are expected in Lower California, northwest of Sonora and the southwestern desert and are the main danger,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
It is estimated that these precipitations will lead to sudden, potentially deadly floods and debris flows in arid areas, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on attempted murder charges after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace neighborhood of Midsomer Norton, Saturday around 4am local time.
He's been sent to the hospital, and his condition is stable.
Avon and Sommerset police said they had arrested the four young men (aged 17, 18 and 20) in the night on the Radstock side.
Officers made a call to people who may have filmed the scene with their phone.
Trump Says Kavanaugh Was Victim of Democrats’ Wickedness and Anger
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and outrageous methods of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump claimed that Kavanaugh had been a victim of the viciousness and anger of Democrats throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh spoke before Congress on Thursday, vigorously and emotionally rejecting allegations by Christine Blasey Ford, who accused her of sexually assaulting her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing.
The president said Saturday that "the American people have witnessed Kavanaugh's intelligence and courage" on this day.
“A vote in the direction of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in the direction of one of the most accomplished lawyers, with a brilliant career in public service,” he told a crowd of supporters gathered in West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke of the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m not a candidate, but I’m more involved than ever,” he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting on all fronts for great candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats were on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
The first vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place by Friday, according to a Republican collaborator's statement to CNN.
Indonesia: an earthquake and a tsunami kill hundreds, the balance continues to increase
On Saturday, authorities said at least 384 people had died, most of them carried away by huge waves that fell on the beaches while an earthquake, followed by a tsunami, hit the Indonesian island of Celebes.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu, when waves of six meters high flooded the beach at nightfall. They took many lives and destroyed everything on their way.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake preceded the tsunami.
“When the threat of the tsunami arose yesterday, everyone was still on the beach. People did not flee immediately, it cost them their lives,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), told a news conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it drove cars, pieces of wood, houses, it took everything with it,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people were able to save their lives by climbing trees, he adds.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial images released by the disaster management agency show destroyed buildings and shops, deformed and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquakes were felt by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said the energy released by Friday’s earthquake was 200 times greater than the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographic location of the city, which borders a long narrow bay, could have amplified the size of the tsunami, she said.
According to Nugroho, the damage is considerable; thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
Bodies were found trapped under the rubble of ruined buildings, he added, specifying that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said the human and material losses could be more severe on the 300 km coastline north of Palu, a region called Donggala, the closest to the epicentre of the earthquake.
The communications were “completely paralyzed” from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
“The situation is dramatic and could well get worse,” she added.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not spreading information that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived at the time the alert was issued.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man on the floor of a building screaming franticly at passers-by on the street as a tsunami approaches.
A few minutes later, a wall of water descends on the coast, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters was not immediately able to authenticate the images.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a general power outage that cut off all communications in Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The army has begun to deliver aid by cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, but the evacuated people still have a great need for food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport reopened as part of the rescue operations, but will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the Palu evacuation centers on Sunday.
Indonesia: Tsunami casualties are on the rise, with more than 800 deaths.
It's a tragedy.
The staff of World Vision of Donggala arrived safely in Palu, where they found refuge in shelters set up in the courtyard of their offices, and on the way they discovered scenes of devastation, says Mr. Doseba.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's a tragedy.
When aid groups began to provide relief to the victims, some complained that highly experienced foreign aid workers were not allowed to travel to Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, foreign funds, supplies and personnel may enter the territory only if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And this is not yet the case.
“This disaster is still considered regional,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government declares this a national disaster, international assistance can intervene, but we are still waiting.”
When the second night after the earthquake and Friday’s tsunami fell on Palu, relatives of the missing people still hoped for a miracle.
On Saturday, a little boy was found in the sewers.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman buried in the rubble for two days, near her mother’s body.
Indonesian national paragliding team coach Gendon Subandono had prepared two of the missing athletes for the Asian Games, which took place a few days earlier in Indonesia.
Other students were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, Mandagi added.
“As a senior in the paragliding discipline, I have experienced my own dramas,” he explains.
In the hours following the announcement of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel in the paragliding community, Gendon said he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to athletes in Palu who were participating in the festival on the beach.
His messages remained unanswered.
“I don’t think they’ve ever received my messages.”
In Newport on the Levee, thieves sublimate $26,750 when recharging a vending machine
On Friday morning, thieves extorted $26,750 from a Brink's agent who was recharging an ATM in Newport on the Leveee, according to a Newport police press release.
The driver of the vehicle was driving a distributor in the entertainment complex and preparing to power it, Inspector Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While he was busy, a man appeared behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money destined for the distributor.
Witnesses reportedly saw many suspects leaving the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity is requested to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is now called Ye.
To announce the news on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “Formerly known as Kanye West.”
At the age of 41, West, who has been calling himself Ye for some time, used this nickname as the title for his eighth album, released in June.
The rapper made this change just before going to Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album, Yandhi.
His participation replaces that of Ariana Grande, who canceled her appearance for “emotional reasons,” the show’s creator explained.
In addition to being the abbreviation of its current professional nickname, this nickname also has a religious meaning for West.
“I think ‘Ye’ is the most used word in the Bible, where it means ‘you’,” West explained earlier this year, referring to the title of his album with his host Big Boy.
“So I’m you, I’m us.
I went from Kanye, which means “the only one,” to Ye – the reflection of good, evil, confusion, everything.
This album is a reflection of who we are.”
West is not the only rapper known to change his name.
Sean Combs called himself Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has collaborated with West in the past, has also played on the union line and capitals.
In Mexico, AMLO says it will never use military force against civilians.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians, nearly fifty years after law enforcement bloody reprisals against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco’s place that he would “never use military force to repress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, the troops opened fire during a pacifist demonstration, killing 300 people as student movements took root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador is committed to supporting Mexican youth by providing monthly student grants and opening more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are driving young people to join criminal gangs.
U.S. Should Double Artificial Intelligence Funding
While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its research funding in this area, according to investor and artificial intelligence expert Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements come after several U.S. government actors made AI-related announcements, while an official AI strategy is lacking in the United States.
In parallel, China presented its roadmap last year: it plans to become the leader in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling funding for AI research would be a good start, as all other countries are ahead of the United States, and we’re looking for the next big AI discovery,” Lee says.
Doubling funds could double the chances that the next key step in the field of AI comes from the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most important AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the top-ranked American Othello player. He then joined the management team of Microsoft Research and became president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee has already participated in technology competitions organized by the U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next competition would take place, in order to identify the visionaries.
According to Lee, American researchers often have to work hard to get funding from the government.
“It’s not China that owns the university leaders, it’s the companies,” Lee says.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have recruited big academic names to work on AI.
Lee added that immigration policy changes could also support U.S. AI efforts.
“I think green cards should be automatically awarded to AI researchers,” he says.
China’s State Affairs Council unveiled its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China grants funding to members of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower,” Lee explained.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is to involve industry and academia partners, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
At the same time, U.S. legislation that works to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not taken any action for several months.
Macedonians participate in the referendum on the name of their country
On Sunday, Macedonians made their voices heard in a referendum on changing their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's application to join the European Union and the OT.
Greece, one of the provinces of which is called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbor represents a right on its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments signed an agreement based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say the change would affect the ethical identity of the majority Macedonian Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote in the referendum and that a boycott campaign had raised doubts about obtaining a minimum 50% turnout required to validate the referendum.
The question of the referendum was: “Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU under the terms of the agreement signed with Greece?”
According to supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, this is the price to pay for joining organizations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, which has survived the collapse of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to vote for the future of my country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that it can live freely under the aegis of the European Union. This means a safer life for each of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would follow the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Electoral Commission announced that no irregularities had been detected at 1 p.m.
But the turnout was only 16%, while it had reached 34% at the same time in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, which had mobilized 66% of the registered voters at the end of the poll.
“I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe,” says Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko participated in the referendum and voted to change the name, in order to open the voice for membership in NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small stage and has the seats in front of the tents installed by those who will boycott the referendum.
“We want to enter the EU and NATO, but we want to enter through the big door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don’t want us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and participate in Eurasian integration.”
According to Prime Minister Zaev, the accession to NATO will allow Macedonia to benefit from the necessary investments.The unemployment rate in the country exceeds 20%.
“I think a large majority will be in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens want to join the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after filing his ballot.
He added that a "yes" would be a "confirmation of our future".
According to a poll published Monday by the Institute for Policy Research of Macedonia, between 30 and 43 percent of voters intend to participate in the referendum, which is lower than the expected participation rate.
Another survey, conducted by the Macedonian channel Telma, estimated the participation at 57%.
70% of participants intending to vote said they would vote “yes”.
For the referendum to be valid, 50% of the vote plus one vote is required.
The failure of the referendum would be the first hard blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it took power in May last year.
Decisive action: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero makes his way through the defence of Brighton to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated the Brighton defenders in Manchester and won the match 2-0 Saturday at Manchester's Etihad Stadium.
Aguero's goal, in the 65th minute, seemed to be the simplest action in the world for the player.
The Argentine goalkeeper received the ball in the middle of the field, at the beginning of the action.
He ran between three defenders from Brighton, before diving into the field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He bypassed a defender before ousting the others close to the goal of Brighton.
Then he passed the ball to Sterling, on his left.
The English forward took advantage to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to trick Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the net.
“Aguero has some problems with his feet,” Pep Guardiola, the team’s coach, told reporters.
“We said he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the initial advantage to the Skyblues in the Premier League game,
from the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball directly on the Brighton field.
He sent it to the left to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few touches before leading Sterling to the second pole.
The front of the Skyblues sent the ball into the nets just before slipping off the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play the party troubles against the Rockies
As the Nationals were eliminated from the play-offs, there was no reason to start a new game.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only in the event of a playoff game for the Rockies, real legends against the Los Angeles Dodgers of the West Division of the National League.
The Rockies won 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still looking to secure their first division title.
“Even if this game is not a challenge, we want to kick the field in Denver, with this atmosphere, with the crowd, and against a team that will probably play at the highest level I will have to face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate?”
The Nationals have yet to announce a pitcher leaving for Sunday, but would be inclined to leave room for Scherzer, in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th start, will be in training on Thursday and will launch during his usual rest day, Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is at 18-7 with an average of 2.53 earned points and 300 withdrawals on 220-step catches and two-thirds this season.
Trump's Interventions in West Virginia
The president alluded to the situation generated by his support for Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court by talking about the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
“All our actions will have an impact in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
It's a major challenge. I'm not a candidate, but I'm more involved than ever. That's why I fight on all fronts for great candidates," he said.
“You see this horrible, really horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it at work.
And they are determined to regain power by all means. See their wickedness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they crush to take power and control, that's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give it to them."
The Democrats are on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
“You can see this over the last four days,” he added, before calling Democrats “angry, mean and lying.”
He referred to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee and Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which earned him public acclaim.
“Do you remember his answer?”
Did you disclose the document?
Ha ha, of course.
No, no. I'm waiting for one. It was a very bad body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer the great community it once was.
He is not tolerant of those who express their ideas.
When activists from my local party’s Momentum movement voted to censor me, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last of a line of Labour MPs considered not to be welcome, all for expressing our ideas.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received the same treatment because she stood up against anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, I was censored because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Ironically, these are topics on which Jeremy himself disagreed with previous leaders.
The notification for the Nottingham East Labour rally on Friday said: “We want the rally to be inclusive and productive.”
This is exactly what the Friday evening general assemblies were like during my eight years as a Labour MP.
Unfortunately, today this is not the case with many rallies and the promise of softer and more respectful policies has long been forgotten, if it has ever been taken into account.
It has become clear that contrary opinions are no longer tolerated within the party, and each opinion is judged on the basis of its acceptability by the party leaders.
This started shortly after Jeremy took power, and colleagues with whom I thought I shared the same political vision began to expect me to turn my back on my jacket and take positions contrary to my convictions, whether on national security or on the EU internal market.
Every time I spoke publicly, and no matter what I said, there was an abusive social media tirade, calling for withdrawal, denouncing the center’s policies, telling me that I shouldn’t be a member of the party.
And it's not just my experience.
Moreover, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments that were addressed to me were of a political nature.
I am in awe of the professionalism and determination of these colleagues, who face a flurry of sexist or racist remarks every day, but who do not give up.
One of the most disappointing things about current politics is the normalization of the various forms of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that large community and that the party is shrinking through motions of no confidence and changes to the selection rules.
I’ve been given a lot of advice over the last two years: lower my eyes, don’t express my ideas so loudly, and everything would go well.
But this is not how I act in politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolchild, because the negligence of Thatcher's government had caused the collapse of my classroom, and since then I've wanted to work for better public services for those who need it most, whether as a local councilor or government minister.
I have never concealed my political ambitions, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be disturbed by my political positions and by my disputes with current party officials.
All I would like to say to those who defended the motion on Friday is that the country is heading towards a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services. I think this is not really the time to waste time and energy debating my loyalty to the leader of the party.
My only message is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my constituents, whether Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of withdrawal or opportunism will stop me from acting for the causes that I stand for, which are in everyone's interest.
Chris Leslie is a member of Parliament for the Nottingham East constituency.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr remains invincible
Two late trials may have distorted the final result, but there is no doubt about it: Ayr deserved this triumph following the intense match day of the Scottish Rugby Championship in XV.
The team now occupies the top of the standings and becomes the only undefeated team in the championship.
In the end, it is the superiority of their defense and the way they are seized of the opportunities that allowed them to open the score. Coach Peter Murchie can congratulate this match.
“So far we’ve been tested, but we’re still undefeated, so I have to feel happy!” he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, congratulated Ayr: “Bravo to them, they have been more effective than us and have been able to seize the opportunities.”
Grant Anderson's 14th minute tryout with Frazier Climo put Ayr in a good position, but a yellow card for the Scottish Rory Hughes squad, released for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to talk the numbers. Jason Baggot took over an untransformed tryout.
Climo aggravated the situation for Ayr with a penalty, before, just at halftime. He scored and transformed a solo try to raise the score to 17-5 for Ayr at the break.
Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's tryout, transformed by Baggot, narrowed the gap to five points.
This was followed by a long wait due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who left the field on a stretcher. During the recovery, Ayr took the lead with a Stafford McDowall trial transformed by Climo.
Blair Macpherson, acting captain of Ayr, then received a yellow card and, again, Melrose tried his luck with an untransformed trial of Bruce Colvine, which created palpable tension.
But the home team took over and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling Climo when he didn't have the ball, MacPherson hit the back of Ayr's advancing butt.
Climo transformed the test, as almost every time since the takeover, after Kyle Rowe assembled David Armstrong's kickboxing and sent Gregor Henry away for the fifth home team test.
Still Game star launches into restoration
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, decided to make a career in catering. The actor was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old man plays Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC show, which he writes and co-animates with his longtime partner on stage, Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the end of the show. And Kiernan seems to be preparing for the post-Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source revealed that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "blossoming restaurant environment."
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, blocked, hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol in an armored boat in the naval headquarters of La Paz.
Public buildings carry a blue flag like the ocean.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases display the following motorcycle: "The sea is right back to us.
Recovering it is a duty.”
Throughout blocked Bolivia, the memory of a coast lost to Chile during a bloody resource conflict in the nineteenth century is still present, as is the desire to sail over the Pacific Ocean, once again.
These hopes have not been so palpable for several decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision of the International Court of Justice, which will be rendered on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the will, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course expects a positive result,” explains Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of the International Court of Justice on the big screen across the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favor of the Bolivian application. Bolivia hopes that, after decades of sporadic negotiations, Chile will be required to negotiate the agreement of a sovereign passage to the ocean to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia (who faces a controversial fight for re-election next year), also has a lot to say about the decision that will be made on Monday.
“We are so close to being able to return to the Pacific Ocean,” he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Chile, and that little would change, even if a positive decision were made.
The Netherlands-based UN body does not have the power to grant Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice renders its decision six months after the last arguments shows that the case “was not complicated,” explains Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from favoring the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may have even harmed it.
“The problem of access to the sea has been diverted by the current Bolivian administration,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales’ bellicose rhetoric undermined all Chilean goodwill that remained, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to trade, but after that it will be very difficult to hold talks.
The last exchange of ambassadors between the two countries took place in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision-making was abnormally fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also challenged the fact that Morales - who remains to this day one of Latin America's most popular presidents - was using the maritime problem as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The Court’s decision is an opportunity to see that we have to get rid of the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will only take place when it can trust the U.S.
Ri Yong Ho, North Korea’s foreign minister, said his country would not dispose of its nuclear weapons until it had confidence in Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to honour the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
He spoke at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears on the verge of relaunching nuclear diplomacy in the deadlock more than three months after Singapore's summit with Kim Jong Un, North Korea's current leader.
Ri says it's "chimeric" to think that maintaining sanctions and the US opposition to a declaration that will end the Korean War will make the North bend.
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration in the absence of prior significant disarmament measures on the part of Pyongyang.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But Pyongyang’s seriousness regarding the renunciation of an arsenal that the country considers the only guarantee of its security is debated.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows unveil the latest trends in headwear, perhaps soon available in your stores
If you want to add XXL pieces to your hat collection or protect yourself from the sun 100%, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented their oversized hat collections at a PE19 fashion show that honored the style of Paris Fashion Week.
Hats all more extravagant than the others invaded Instagram this summer, and the creators decided to integrate their delusional pieces into the parades.
Valentino's flagship piece was a beige eccentric hat adorned with a wide edge evoking a feather, which swallowed the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jewel-set watermelons, a sorcerer's hat, and even a pineapple, but these pieces weren't designed to keep you warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of original masks just in time for Halloween.
Most of the masks had sewn lips and evoked more Hannibal Lecter than Haute-Couture.
One creation resembled a diving gear, with tuba and glasses, while another made it look like a melted ice cone.
And if you follow fashion trends, then you’re in luck.
According to style observers, the imposing hats could come all the way to your shopping streets.
.The XXL hats follow in the footsteps of the Bomba, the wide-brimmed straw hat that the stars rip off, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that markets this difficult-to-wear hat that has flooded social media has presented another of its flagship creations on the podium: a straw beach bag almost as big as the swimsuit model who wore it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, adorned with raffia fringes and a handful of white leather, was the centerpiece of the PE19 La Riviera de Jacquemus parade at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see the big hats and beach bags arrive in stores for next summer. The designer has so marked the minds that it is obvious that there will be demand for oversize accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for the citizens of the world
Scotland’s independent schools maintain a record of school excellence. This trend continued in 2018 with new excellent exam results reinforced by collective and individual success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to offer the best level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools work to prepare their students for higher education, the career they have chosen, and their place as citizens of the world.
As an education sector able to design and implement a tailor-made school curriculum, we find that contemporary languages remain popular and desirable subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you speak to his head.
If you speak to him in his language, you speak to his heart.”
This reminds us that we cannot rely on English to build relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
If we look at the excellent results in the exams this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the ranking, with the highest success rates in independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved the highest grade, A.
Data collected from the 74 member schools of the SCIS show that 72% of pupils obtained the highest grade, A, in Mandarin, as well as the 72% of pupils who studied German, the 69% of pupils who studied French and the 63% of pupils who studied Spanish.
This shows that Scotland’s independent schools support foreign languages as absolutely essential skills for children and young people in the future.
Now, languages as subjects are organized just like science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the programs of independent schools and other schools.
A 2014 UK Commission on Employment and Skills survey found that 17% of employers’ difficulties in recruiting candidates are related to insufficient language skills.
Language skills are therefore increasingly vital in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more job offers requiring languages, these skills are essential in our globalized world.
No matter your career choice, a person who speaks a second language will benefit from a real benefit in the future thanks to this sustainable skill.
Being able to communicate directly with strangers will automatically put the multilingual person in front of his competitors.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of 4,000 adults living in the UK, 75% of them did not speak a foreign language enough to hold a conversation. French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage (15%).
This is why investing in language learning is important for children today.
By speaking several languages, especially those of emerging economies, children will have a better chance of finding a rewarding job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Many of them will focus on classical contemporary languages, while others will teach languages considered important for the UK in the 2020 perspective, including Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s preferences, several languages will be available in independent schools, with specialist staff in the field.
Scottish independent schools want to offer a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds for them.
It is clear that, in today's global business environment, languages remain of paramount importance for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be considered as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
You have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron to make his Lakers debut Saturday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans watching LeBron James' debut at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, the Lakers coach, announced that James would play Sunday, in pre-season opening, against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
We don’t know how many minutes he will play.
“More than one, less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would likely play for a limited few minutes.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the pre-season program, which includes six games.
“At this point in my career, I don’t need pre-season games to be ready.”
Trump campaign in West Virginia (YouTube channel)
President Donald Trump is opening a series of campaign meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Other stopovers, particularly in states like Tennessee and Mississippi where the president is popular, are planned.
With the vote to confirm the vacancy at the Supreme Court postponed, Trump is seeking to garner support for the upcoming midterm elections and prevent Republicans from losing control of Congress in the November vote.
What time is Trump’s meeting in West Virginia tonight and how to watch it online?
Trump’s meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. (Eastern Time) tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow it online below, live on YouTube.
Trump is expected to address the issue of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh’s hearings, which took place this week. Kavanaugh’s confirmation vote in the Senate is expected to be postponed to a week during the FBI investigation.
But this series of meetings is primarily aimed at helping Republicans gain ground ahead of the November elections.
According to Reuters, the North American president said in his campaign that the five meetings were aimed at “encouraging volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Congressional control is such an essential part of his program that the president will travel to as many states as possible at the start of this busy election campaign,” a spokesman for the Trump team told Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, tonight’s meeting, scheduled at Wheeling’s Wesbanco Arena, could bring together supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, and draw the attention of the Pittsburgh media.”
Saturday will be Trump’s second visit in a month to West Virginia, a state he won in 2016 by more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate, who is trailing in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to revive him in the polls,” Simon Haeder, a political science specialist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team ready to fight for hope ahead of Sunday singles
After three singles, the foursomes on Saturday afternoon could well represent what was missing in this Ryder Cup.
The momentum balancing movement is a sporting concept invented in every way but which players sincerely believe in, and more than ever in tournaments such as this one.
So where would they put the momentum now?
“They were leading with six points ahead and now four, so it gives us a bit of wings,” Spieth said as he left for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, with four points ahead and twelve more to play.
The Americans, according to Spieth, feel a little windy and have every reason to be encouraged, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas who have played together all day and can be proud to have each scored three points out of four.
Spieth has proven to be terribly effective from tee to green and sets the example.
The energetic cheers intensified as his game progressed. A crucial putt allowed him to equalize to the fourth part while Thomas and him were led two down after two holes.
His putt, thanks to which they won the match at the 15th hole, aroused a similar cry, from those who tell you that he believes the American team is still competing.
“We really need to stay determined and focus on his game,” Spieth said.
That's all that's left for each of these players, now.
18 holes to stand out.
The only players to have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, as evidenced by the Ryder Cup history.
The strange but adorable European pair has won four out of four games and is not entitled to the mistake.
Not only were “Moliwood” the only ones not to make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also escaped on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and during the last nine holes on Friday morning.
This series, the way their energy seems to circulate between them and the crowd delusional about them designates them as the players to beat on Sunday, and there is no player more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari to delight in a potential European victory as the sun sets on the National Golf.
Preferably, both at different holes at the same time.
But talking about European glory is still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly beat Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourballs, as he teamed up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine shots sent the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole from which they could never emerge.
On Sunday, no one is there to help you.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interactions between pairs, the advice they give and those they don’t, and how a strategy can flip in a blink of an eye.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a considerable lead over the last day, but this foursome session also proved that Americans have the courage to fight, which some doubted, especially in the country.
Europe leads 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will enjoy a solid advantage in the last day of the Ryder Cup after winning 10-6 against the United States in Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a Tiger Woods in distress, which allowed them to score four points so far.
Determined to keep the title she lost to Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Bjorn’s European team made a difference by imposing 3-1 in the morning fourballs, facing a messy American team.
The United States showed greater resistance in the foursomes and won two victories, but they failed to resorb the gap.
Jim Furyk’s men must score eight points out of 12 on Sunday in the singles to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while Molinari and he, dubbed "Molliwood" after a failed weekend, are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in their first four games.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, they flattened the pair of American beginner Bryson Dechambeau and a Woods already tired of an even more categorical 5 and 4.
Woods, who dragged himself through the two games on Saturday, shone a few times, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 four-ball and foursome games, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, well-rested for the morning fourballs, teamed up with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, winning a 2-1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, respectively number one and three in the world rankings.
Europe was not spared during the tournament that took place in the southwest of Paris, under a cool but clear weather.
Triple winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans by scoring two points on Saturday.
They won a well-deserved 2-1 victory against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and again beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes, these having lost the first two holes.
Twice in Ryder Cup history, a team recovered from a four-point gap in singles, although Furyk's team, who held the crown, only had to make a draw to keep his trophy.
After being second for two days, however, they may not recover from a counter-attack on Sunday.
North Korea says disarmament can’t be done unilaterally without confidence.
On Saturday, the North Korean foreign minister told the United Nations that maintaining sanctions reinforced his distrust of the United States and that it would be impossible for his country to unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons in these circumstances.
At the World Health Organization’s annual General Assembly, Ri Yong Ho said North Korea had taken “important goodwill measures” last year, such as ending nuclear testing and missile testing, dismantling the nuclear testing site and its commitment not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
“In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will fear for our national security, and under such circumstances, it is excluded that we will be the first to unilaterally disarm.”
While reiterating North Korea’s well-known accusations of Washington’s opposition to a “step-by-step” approach to denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded if it gradually took action, its statement proved important in that it did not reject the idea of a unilateral denuclearization.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, made on June 12 in Singapore at the very first summit between an incumbent US president and a North Korean leader, when Kim pledged to work for “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” while Trump promised to ensure North Korea’s security.
North Korea seeks to officially end the Korean War (1950-1953), but the United States has stated that Pyongyang must first renounce its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also denied requests to ease tough international sanctions against North Korea.
The U.S. insists that North Korea first proceed to denuclearization and escalates pressure by imposing sanctions to achieve its goal coercively, even opposing the “end of war declaration.”
“Those who think that these sanctions can make us do it don’t know us.
The problem is that maintaining sanctions increases our mistrust.”
Ri made no comment on the second summit between Kim and Trump highlighted before the United Nations by the US leader earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the party involved in the denuclearization issue were South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not be in such a deadlock.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri’s speech was radically different from last year’s, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to point North Korean missiles at North American territory after President Trump called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
Trump, who had threatened the United Nations last year to “totally destroy” North Korea, did not praise this year for the courage with which Kim applied disarmament measures, but added that much still remains to be done and that sanctions would not be lifted until North Korea disarms.
On Wednesday, Trump said no deadline had been set. “It can take two years, three years or five months; it doesn’t matter,” he said.
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures adopted.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council last Thursday that: “The implementation of Security Council sanctions must be firmly and systematically maintained until total, final and verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to stifle funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then announced that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
This year, Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times, but his last trip was somewhat disastrous.
In July, he left Pyongyang claiming that progress had been made but, in the hours that followed, North Korea denounced his “gangster methods.”
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site as well as a nuclear complex if the United States took “equivalent measures.”
According to the South Korean president, Kim demands the security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore, and efforts to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard: Students take resting classes
This year, Harvard University has put in place a new course that allows all undergraduate students to sleep more and fights the growing macho trend of studying by consuming caffeine all night long.
One professor noticed that most students at the world’s best university don’t know how to take care of them
The course, designed by Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the first of its kind in the United States.
It was after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning that the idea came to him
At the end, a student came up to me and said, "Why are they only telling me this in the last year?"
She claimed that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
This course, delivered for the first time this year, explains to students the need to adopt good sleep habits to improve their school and physical performance, as well as their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and general director of the university's health services, said the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students were suffering from a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The course time consists of various interactive exercises.
One of the sections presents the image of a dormitory containing different objects (coffee cups, curtains, sneakers, books...) on which students click to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on their physical performance and the importance of integrating a routine before bedtime.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map featuring interactive icons then invites participants to reflect on their daily routine.
“We know that this won’t instantly change the behavior of students.
However, in our opinion, they have the right to know this information – in the same way that you have the right to know what the health effects of smoking are,” added Professor Czeisler.
According to him, the culture of pride in “spending a white night” still exists, and he adds that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure exerted on students make sleep deprivation a growing problem.
Having sufficient and good quality sleep should be students’ “secret weapon” to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said – even to avoid gaining weight, as lack of sleep puts the brain in innocence mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student in chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design this course after being one of his students last year during his first year at Harvard.
He claimed that this course had opened his eyes and pushed him to insist that it be proposed to the entire campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to offer all postgraduate students a similar degree program before joining the reputable institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends students to provide an alarm for both bedtime and waketime, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which can disrupt their circadian rhythm and lead to sleep disturbances.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's Goal Drops Gerrard's Men
The Rangers suffered another hard blow outside, Dolly Menga's attack leading Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
The Ibrox team had hoped to record their first win on the move since their 4-1 triumph in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted Gerrard his second loss in 18 games as a coach, leaving his team in the lead, eight points behind the Hearts, leaders of the Ladbroke Premier League.
Menga hit seven minutes before the halftime and the team of the Rangers, short of inspiration, failed to equalize.
As the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston rises to third, just behind Hibernian on the goal difference.
And other difficulties could be felt for the Rangers, as referee Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury following an object being thrown from the opposite side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which swept Ayr in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, meanwhile, chose the same Livi 11 that tore a point at the Hearts last week and would have been delighted to see his well-trained team suffocating his opponents every lap.
The Rangers may have mastered possession of the ball, but Livingston has done more.
They should have scored at two minutes, when Menga's first shot sent Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his chance.
Keaghan Jacobs then fired a powerful shot towards Captain Craig Halkett, but his teammate defender Alan Lithgow could only reach the second pole.
The Rangers managed to take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should have benefited from a penalty after the free kick when Steven Lawless and him collided but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's demands.
The Rangers took advantage of only two shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely troubled by Lassana Coulibaly and a hit from Ovie Ejaria.
If the opening of the score by Livi in the 34th minute was against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it because of their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers failed in the face of Jacobs's arrest.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher handed the ball over to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool to choose Menga for an end all in simplicity.
Gerrard reacted halfway by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the exchange almost had an immediate impact when the winger appeared in front of Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed to block.
Livingston nevertheless continued to push visitors to play exactly the type of game they love, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping long balls on long balls.
Holt's team could have taken the lead in the final moments, but McGregor did well to push Jacobs back before Lithgow missed the goal.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton once again claimed a penalty at the end of the game while he was struggling with Jacobs, but Thomson ignored him again.
Almanach: The Inventor of the Geiger Meter
And now, a page from our Almanac “Sunday Morning”: On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and THE TOURNAL ACCOUNTANT... was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger, in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity; an invention that subsequently gave rise to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A pillar of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become fundamental in pop culture, as seen in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, two unlikely scientists:
One man said, “What is this?”
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter, it’s used to look for radioactive minerals, like uranium.
With these headphones, you can really hear the effects of the atoms released into the minerals by radioactivity.”
Evans: “So tell me, it sure jumps here!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears its name remains.
New cancer vaccine allows the immune system to “detect” cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to “detect” cancer cells and kill them
In the course of treatment, the vaccine tells the immune system how to recognize cancer cells
This technique involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory.
They can then “detect” a protein that is common to many cancers, and are then re-injected.
An experimental vaccine shows encouraging results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, whose goal is to teach the immune system to recognize cancer cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory, so that they can detect the HER2 protein common to many cancers, and finally reinjecting them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
According to Professor Berzofsky, the HER2 protein “causes an increase in several types of cancer”, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer.
A similar approach, consisting of taking immune cells to “learn” how to target cancer cells, has been proven in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Headed with a MAGA cap, Kanye West started in a Pro-Trump diatribe after his move to the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was hoarse on the set after a wild performance during which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump on a Saturday Night Live and announced that he would run for election in 2020.
After his third track, Ghost Town, which he sang wearing a Make America Great Again cap, West took on the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“Many times I talk to white people and they say, ‘How can you love Trump? He’s racist!’”
“Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL show began with a sketch by Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocks Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, West's diatribe recording was relayed on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
We don’t know if Rock intended to make fun of West with this publication.
In addition, West had complained to the public that he had spent a bad quarter of an hour behind the scenes because of his cap.
“They put pressure on me.
They told me not to come with that cap on my head.
They put pressure on me!
And then they say I'm in a hole," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see him, the hole?" and claimed that he would wear his superman cape, because no one can dictate his actions to him.
Try the love.”
His comments drew at least two leaks from the public and members of the SNL seemed embarrassed, reports Variety. One person on the scene told the magazine: "A death silence fell on the whole set."
West had been called in to replace at the last minute the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West disarmed a lot of people by singing the song I Love it in a Perrier bottle suit.
West received the support of the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who posted the following tweet: “To one of the bravest minds: THANK YOU FOR HAVING HEADED TO THE FOOL.”
But Karen Hunter, the show’s host, tweeted that West was simply “faithful to himself, and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
“However, I choose not to reward someone (by buying his music, his clothes, or by supporting his art) who, in my opinion, adopts and pours out an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so are we,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and claimed that he was now "officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapper Snoop Dogg took the name of Snoop Lion and of course the legendary fire Prince, who changed his name to symbol, then that of the artist previously known as Prince.
Belfast: Murder Attempt Charged After White Gun Assault at Restaurant
A 45-year-old man is accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed last Friday in a restaurant east of Belfast.
According to police, the incident happened in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast trial court on Monday.
The indictments will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Kit Harington, the star of the Game of Thrones series, takes on toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his fine-blade role, Jon Snow in Game of Thrones, HBO’s violent medieval fantasy series.
But the 31-year-old actor took to the stereotype of the macho hero, claiming that this type of role on the screen often leads young boys to pretend to be hard to cook to be respected.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes “something is wrong” and addressed the issue of toxic masculinity at #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie, a Game of Thrones co-star, also aged 31, has admitted that he “strongly” wants to address this issue.
“Personally, I think deeply that we have misused masculinity.”
“What lessons have we given to young men who are becoming adults, in relation to the problem that now arises?”
According to Kit, television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
He continued: “What behavior is innate, what behavior has been inculcated?
What do television and the street teach young boys to think that they have to behave like this in order to be a man?
I think that’s really one of the fundamental questions of our time – how can we change that?
There’s obviously something wrong with it.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make prologues or sequels when the series ends next summer, claiming he ended up with “the battlefields and the horses.”
Starting in November, Kit will star in a True West remake of Sam Shepard, which tells the story of a movie producer and his brother, a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that ever happened to him in Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this series, so she gave me my future family and my life from now on,” he says.
Rose played Ygritte, Kit's character's lover, Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that won an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 in Scotland, at Leslie’s family estate.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
According to the Chinese health authorities, more than 820,000 people are affected.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the patients were infected during sexual intercourse, which is a new fact.
Historically, the virus has spread rapidly to parts of the country following contaminated blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to virtually zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference held in Yunnan province.
However, from one year to the next, the number of HIV-positive and AIDS-positive people in China has increased by 100,000.
In the Chinese LGBT community, the transmission of HIV through sex is a serious problem.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains widespread.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70% to 90% of gay men end up marrying a woman.
Many cases of transmissions are due to inadequate sexual protection.
As part of its efforts to address this problem, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medicines since 2003.
Maxine Waters denies that a GOP employee disclosed data relating to senators, and denounces “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
On Saturday, U.S. Republican Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of her team published personal information about three Republican senators on Wikipedia pages dedicated to lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that these statements were backed by “extreme right” experts and websites.
“Liars, lies, and more infamous lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
It appears that the information disclosed included the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information was put online Thursday by a stranger at Capitol Hill during the Senate session on allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators interrogated Kavanaugh.
According to Hill, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState indicated that the IP address identifying the source of the messages was associated with Waters' office and disclosed information from a Waters staff member.
According to Waters, “this unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie.”
“The member of my team, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised due to these fraudulent and false allegations, is in no way responsible for the leak of this information.”
“This false allegation is completely false and a real lie.”
Waters' statement quickly aroused online criticism, including from Ari Fleischer, the former White House press attaché.
“This denial is anger,” he wrote.
“This indicates that she does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t be angry.
It must not be provocative.
It must not question the motives of the accuser.
She must remain calm and serene.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who appeared too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate at Waters headquarters in the midterm elections, also shared his thoughts on Twitter.
“If it’s true, it’s huge,” he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted “the law enforcement authorities and services concerned” about these fraudulent claims.
“We will ensure that the culprits are exposed and that they are held accountable for all their destructive and dangerous acts for all members of my team.”
Johnny English hit again. Parody of Rowan Atkinson, underdog spy
It has now become a tradition to look for the scope of Brexit in any new British film and this seems to apply to this revival of the action comedy Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and resurfaced in 2011 with Johnny English, the return.
Will the ironic self-satisfaction on the question of the evidence of our insignificance represent the new export opportunity of our country?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with squint eyes and a rubber face, saw his license renewed for the second time in a confusing context - this name indicates above all that this is a great comic creation designed for a non-English-speaking film audience.
Of course, he is the stupid secret agent who, despite his dubious attempts as a glamorous charmer, possesses a bit of Clouseau, a suspicion of Mr Bean, and a good dose of the guy who performs a small note in The Fire Trucks at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
Originally, he was also inspired by the traveler and international mystery man that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercials, leaving the chaos behind him.
The last Johnny English features one or two sympathetic moments.
I liked Johnny English approaching a helicopter while he was wearing a medieval armor and the rotor blades were briefly striking his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is highlighted, though humor is rather insufficient and strangely superfluous, especially at a time when "serious" licenses like 007 and Mission Impossible compose themselves confidently with comedy.
The humor seems to be more child-oriented than adult-oriented, and to me, Johnny English’s quirky misadventures are less creative and less targeted than Atkinson’s silent film gags in Bean’s character.
The perpetually up-to-date premise is that Britain has serious problems.
A hacker has infiltrated the super-secret web network of British spies, revealing the identity of all British agents in the field, to the great dismay of agents on duty - an alas small-scale role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that overflows the vase for a prime minister who is a pompous character on the brink of crisis and who already suffers from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this quasi-Teresa-May character, but there is not much to put under her teeth in the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that after every active spy has been compromised, she will have to get someone out of retirement.
This means that you have to bother Johnny English himself, who is now employed in a chic establishment as a schoolteacher, but who secretly gives lessons on how to become a secret agent: some nice jokes here, because English offers a Rock Academy way espionage academy.
English is taken back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and finds Bough, his former long-time partner, again camped by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, attached to a submarine commander, a fun hockey stick role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So, Batman and Robin, who create great trouble for His Majesty's secret services, go back to the action and meet Olga Kurylenko, the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the grip of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough launch their odyssey of wild jokes: under the guise of waiters, they set fire to a glittering French restaurant; they create chaos by sneaking on the luxurious sailboat of Volta; and English unleashes a real anarchy when he tries, with a virtual reality helmet, to familiarize himself with it.
All stops are insured for this last sequence, but despite everything, there’s a lot for the kids in all of this.
A rather moderate film.
I couldn’t help but think, as with the other Johnny English films: can’t the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that will really value his talent?
Labour denies having developed a plan for the British to work four days but be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party must consider a radical plan that will allow the British to work four days a week – but be paid for five.
Apparently, the party wants business leaders to benefit workers from the savings generated by artificial intelligence (AI) by giving them an extra day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend while continuing to earn the same salary.
According to some sources, the idea would be consistent with the party's economic program and plans to orient the country in favor of workers.
The move to a four-day week was approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a means for workers to benefit from economic change.
A senior Labour source told the Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.”
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day work week is a goal that goes hand in hand with the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of workers as well as its overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party was committed to a four-day working week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: “A four-day working week is not a party policy and is not envisaged by the party.”
Deputy Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week’s Labour conference to give details of his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell expressed his determination to regain power in the hands of "anonymous directors" and "profiteers" in utilities.
The deputy chancellor's plans also foresee that the current shareholders of the water companies may not recover their full stake as the Labour government could make "deductions" due to alleged misconduct.
It also confirmed its plan to integrate workers into corporate boards of directors as well as the creation of an inclusive shareholder fund that will pay 10% of the capital of private companies to employees, who will earn up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 in dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are counting on “60 Minutes” if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The final vote on Brett Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court was postponed by at least a week following the FBI's investigation into the charges brought against him and raises the question of whether the Bureau's findings could prompt Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, Scott Pelley, the correspondent for the 60 Minutes program, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina colleague.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“Going to the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, when these allegations were made, and I asked him, "Did you do that?"
He was determined, determined, unequivocal.”
However, Graham’s vote seems engraved in stone.
“I made my decision regarding Brett Kavanaugh and an explosive indictment would be needed,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett categorically denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And the people she names couldn’t verify it.
It's a 36-year-old case.
I don’t see anything new that changes.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring a very impressive roster of stars and invested with an equally impressive mission: ending poverty in the world.
The Global Citizen Festival, now in its seventh edition, will see tens of thousands of people flock to Central Park’s Great Lawn to not only benefit from the performance of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise public awareness of the festival’s true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, first held in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), viewers had to complete a series of tasks, or “actions,” such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, calling or making any other useful effort to raise public awareness of the fight against poverty.
But to what extent can the Global Citizen organization still achieve its goal in the remaining twelve years?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really make it possible to persuade them to demand a call to action, or is it just another example of "clitivism" - a situation in which people really think they can make a difference by signing a petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million “shares” from its supporters, who advocate for many different goals.
According to the organization, these actions have helped inspire global leaders to make commitments and adopt policies amounting to more than $37 billion that are expected to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its shares, of which at least a $10 billion tranche has already been disbursed or withdrawn.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Among the key commitments is The Power of Nutrition, a British partnership of investors and executives who have committed to “help children develop their full potential,” while promising Rwanda <0xC2><0xA3>35 million in aid to end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 messages from Global Citizens.
“Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” Tracey Ullman, The Power of Nutrition program ambassador, told the crowd at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that following the company's more than 5,000 actions to ask the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government has announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children through nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on his website, “What makes you think it’s possible to end extreme poverty?”,
Global Citizen said: “The path to get there will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and we will fail.
However, like the great civil rights movements and the struggle against apartheid before us, we will succeed, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the artists who will perform this year in New York, where Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will animate the show.
U.S. could call on the Navy to create a "blockade" to impede Russian energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
In order to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, Washington can “if necessary” appeal to the U.S. Navy, said Ryan Zinke, U.S. Secretary of the Interior, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke said Russia's presence in Syria - particularly where it operates at the request of the legitimate government - is a pretext that allows it to explore new energy markets.
“I believe they are in the Middle East with the goal of negotiating energy as they are in Eastern Europe, the southern center of Europe,” he said.
According to the official representative, there are ways to remedy this.
“The United States can, with our Navy, ensure that the shipping lanes are opened and, if necessary, obstructed to ensure that their energy is not put on the market,” he added.
Zinke addressed attendees at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that defines itself as the “speaker of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are in fact identical.
“As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic option lies more or less in the exploitation and replacement of fuels,” he said, while referring to Russia as having “more than one bow rope” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration has pledged to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper solution for European consumers.
To do this, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to exit the “inappropriate” project of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, makes the city of Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double its current capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
In a speech in Moscow in September following a meeting with Rick Perry, U.S. Secretary of Energy, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said, “I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers.”
The position of the United States has generated negative reactions from Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in this project.
Germany's main industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States not to engage in European energy policy or bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a huge problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, director of the German Industry Federation (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider the possibility of running for president in the 2020 presidential election, says the Senator of Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would seriously consider running for president in the aftermath of the midterm elections.
At a public meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would be considering introducing herself.
“The time has come for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and for that, a woman will have to be at the top,” she said.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider submitting my candidacy for the presidential election.”
Warren said what she thought of President Donald Trump at the public rally, saying he was “leading this country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m very worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was frank in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Obviously we need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
However, a poll published Thursday showed that the majority of Warren’s voters are not of the opinion that she should be running in 2020.
According to a poll by the University of Suffolk and the Boston Globe Political Research Center, 58% of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator should not come forward.
32% were in favour of such a campaign.
The poll found that former Governor Deval Patrick was more supportive, with 38% in favor of a potential campaign and 48% against it.
Other names of prominent Democrats cited for a potential 2020 campaign include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin discusses Track Palin’s PTSD during Donald Trump’s rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq following his enlistment in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident.
“What my own son is experiencing right now, what he feels when he comes home, I can connect him to other families who are feeling the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries that our soldiers are coming back with,” she told the audience at the rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a “taboo subject” and said about his son and other veterans that “they come back a little different, hardened, wondering if we respect what their comrades and members of the air force, and every other soldier, gave to the country.”
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police service, he was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, interfering with a relationship of domestic violence and possession of a weapon in a drunken state.
18 states and the District of Columbia are in favour of a judicial challenge to the new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia are in favor of a judicial challenge to the new U.S. policy that refuses asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
On Friday in Washington, representatives from 18 states and the district filed a memorandum in favor of an asylum seeker who challenged the policy, NBC News said.
The full name of the complainant in Grace v. Sessions opened in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner “and her sons, members of violent gangs,” had assaulted her, but U.S. authorities decided to reject her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
State prosecutors who support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications in the United States, as countries facing widespread gang and domestic violence problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Immigrant Appeals Board that allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
“The federal law stipulates that all applications for asylum must be examined on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates this principle,” the amicus curiae said in its memorandum.
Lawyers also argued in the memo that the immigration refusal policy harms the U.S. economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary work.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
“Asylum is granted to people who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear for reasons of race, belief, nationality, belonging to a particular social group or political convictions,” Sessions said in its announcement of the policy.
"Asylum has never been designed to alleviate all the problems -- even the most serious -- that people face every day around the world."
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is increasingly dramatic.
“I feel very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, comforting her feverish little boy in Palu, in an evacuation center from the empty city.
“An ambulance brings back bodies at every moment.
Clean water is rare.”
Residents were seen roaming their destroyed homes, picking up stuffed goods and trying to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake were submerged.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who was suffering from a fractured back and shoulders, rested in front of the military hospital in Palu, where the patients were treated outside due to strong persistent replications.
Tears filled his eyes when he told how he felt the violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I was crushed in the ruins of the wall, I believe,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife call for help, but after the silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Intimidation’ Through ‘Propaganda Ads’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad praising the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China in a U.S. daily, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily’s surcharge in the Des Moines Register — Iowa’s best-selling newspaper — after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 U.S. parliamentary elections, an accusation China refutes.
By accusing Beijing of wanting to interfere in the US elections, Trump marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in a growing campaign led by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently paralyzed in a growing trade war that has led them to apply reciprocal tariffs on their imports.
At the start of the trade war, China’s tariff measures were aimed at hitting exporters from states like Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former long-time governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad writes in an opinion piece published in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “is doubling its intimidation by publishing propaganda in our own free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press by inserting paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad writes.
“On the other hand, at the Beijing newsstand, you will find few voices of protest and you will not see the true reflection of the divergent views that the Chinese may have on China’s troubling economic trajectory, because the media is firmly obeying the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most important newspapers has avoided publishing” his article, without saying which newspaper.
Analysts warn Republicans are alienating electres as midterm elections approach due to Kavanaugh’s debacle
While many high-ranking Republicans are defending Brett Kavanaugh, who has been nominated to the Supreme Court in a context of allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that a negative reaction, particularly among women, could occur during the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiments surrounding this case have been extremely lively, and most Republicans have already publicly shown that they want the vote to take place.
In a September 29 article in The Hill, Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse's Maxwell School, stated "we can't go back."
Reeher added that he doubted that the last-minute efforts by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) in favor of an FBI investigation would be enough to calm voters' anger.
According to Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, “women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow, and not in November,” she said on Sept. 28, according to the Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, Mic reports, protesters chanted “November is Coming!” in the Senate hallway as Republicans running the Judiciary Committee chose to advance Kavanaugh’s appointment despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be outsized,” said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
“People say it’s already high, that’s true.
But it could be even higher, especially among suburban electors and young voters between the ages of 18 and 29 who, even if they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony detailed allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that the reaction would be likely to be lively if Republicans advanced confirmation.
According to NBC News, former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said earlier this week that “It has become a messy mess for the GOP.”
“It’s not just about the committee vote or the final vote, it’s also about how Republicans handled the situation and how they treated it,” said Guy Cecil, director of U.S. Priorities, a group that helps elected Democrats.
Following testimony from Ford and Kavanaugh, however, the Americans seem to be divided about the credibility of the two parties, with a small majority leaning towards the latter.
A new YouGov poll found that 41% of respondents believed absolutely or probably in Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they believed absolutely or probably in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they believed that Kavanaugh probably or absolutely lied during his testimony, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
According to The Guardian, the FBI is investigating allegations made by Ford and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, following pressure from Senator Flake.
Ford testified last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee that she had been assaulted by Kavanaugh while he was drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that when they were studying at Yale in the 1980s, the Supreme Court candidate showed him his genitals during a party.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a brand new company that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of Berners-Lee’s free platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored as well as who is authorized to access this or that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said, jokingly, that Inrupt was aimed at “dominating the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the launch.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “online personal data store” or DPL.
This can contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available at the same time on a single browser.
The peculiarity of the online personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access what type of information.
The company calls this “personal responsibility via data.”
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, Inrupt’s idea is that the company brings appropriate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a few contract developers working on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said his team and he are not yet in discussions with “Facebook and Google” to see whether or not to make a complete change where all their business models are completely messed up in an instant.
“We don’t ask for permission.”
In an article published on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee writes that "[Inrupt's] mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem in order to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Although he launched Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am extremely optimistic about this new era of the web,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of a First World War cleric decorated with the Victoria Cross
The only Church of England clergyman to have received the Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann won this distinction on 29 September 1918, during the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was however killed by an elite sniper four days later and did not know that he had obtained the highest British military distinction.
His two grandsons unveiled a memorial stone during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, said it was “brilliantly symbolic” to unveil the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s exploit.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion on the St. Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog and under the violent firing of field guns and machine guns".
Later, he rushed to the line of fire and, with the "greatest bravery", led the line before blowing up a field cannon on his own and assassinating three detachment soldiers.
On October 4, 1918, a German sniper killed Lieutenant-Colonel Vann, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I’ll never be up to, but that makes me humble.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt “very honored to be part of the parade” and added that “the courage of an authentic hero is reflected in the support that will be given to him by many people.”
Mixed martial arts fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206. Instead, they had Peppa Pig
Imagine that, you spent all night watching a well-filled Bellator 206, but you couldn’t see the main event.
In San José, the event featured 13 fights, including six on the main page, and was broadcast live throughout the night in the UK, on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, British viewers were stunned when the broadcast changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were dissatisfied with staying awake until the early hours of the morning, especially for combat.
A supporter on Twitter described the passage to the children’s cartoon as “a kind of bad joke.”
Regarding the broadcast, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, Dave Schwartz, said that “the government regulation stipulates that at 6 a.m. this content was not appropriate, so they had to switch to children’s shows.”
"Peppa the pig, yes."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they would work on their programming to include British viewers in the future.
“I think when I think about re-broadcasting, I think we can probably find a solution,” Coker said.
“However, it is six o’clock in the morning on a Sunday and we will not be able to find a solution until Sunday our hour, or Monday their hour.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program flipped, there were a lot of messages in both directions and they weren’t all friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't a problem, it was a government issue.
I can assure you it won't happen next time.
We’ll limit ourselves to five fights instead of six – as we usually do – and we’ve tried to give more for the fans and we’ve ruined everything.
This is an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels ‘Lower’ in Sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality – but that has instilled in him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize before going to high school that “everyone [was] not like me.”
As part of the first broadcast of Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about the issue of gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that becoming a parent had made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The show’s regular host, Kirsty Young, took several months off because of her illness.
Appearing as a shipwreck in Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less than" all the other kids growing up because "it wasn't socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said: “Even today, these feelings of being inferior and different are the real things that gave me the power and strength I needed to succeed.”
In order not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned the truth about his sexuality, he wanted to prove that he was “something,” he continued.
The double Olympic bronze medalist is now a renowned LGBT activist and has taken advantage of his participation this year in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on a larger number of countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he expressed himself because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and that he wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said he "didn't expect" to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, met in 2013
Daley married her 20-year-old eldest Oscar winner last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you live so much at such a young age" - he participated in his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said confidently that it was difficult to find a person of the same age who had experienced the same highs and lows.
In June, they became parents to a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that “his whole perspective” had changed.
“If you asked me last year, I was just thinking about winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
“My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked him was if they already had their tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t say to him, ‘Daddy, you’re not going to be here anymore to be in the front row,’” he said.
“I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing and he had to stop breathing and he died so that I would finally recognize that he was not invincible,” he added.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
"It was all I'd dreamed of my whole life - diving in front of a crowd at home at the Olympics, there's nothing better," he said.
In addition, it inspired her first song choice - Heather Small's Proud - which had accompanied her in preparation for the Olympics and still gave her the chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15, BST.
A Mickelson out of shape on the bench of the Ryder Cup Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will make a record this Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to straighten out to avoid it being an unfortunate step.
Mickelson, who participated in the biennial competition for the twelfth time, a record, was knocked out by Captain Jim Furyk of fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as so often has been the case for the United States, the five-time grand champion divided his day between the role of enduring and the refinement of his game at the stand in order to remedy his ailments.
He has never been the greatest of the leaders, even at the height of his career. At 48, he is not the most suitable for the difficult National Golf, where the long rough systematically punishes the missed shots.
And as if the course wasn’t scary enough in itself, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth game, faced British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who teamed up this week with Tommy Fleetwood to win their four games.
If the Americans, four down at the start of the 12 games in singles, take a good start, Mickelson's match could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his man, but he could not say much else.
“He fully understood the role he had to play today, gave me a slap in the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has great confidence in him.
He’s a legendary champion and he’s added so much to these teams in the past, just like he did this week.
I probably didn’t see him play two games.
I was planning more, but that's how it happened and that's how we felt we had to do it.
He wants to be there, like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldo’s record for the most Ryder Cup matches played.
This could mark the end of a career at the Ryder Cup that has never quite reached the heights of its individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk said his presence brought concrete elements to the team.
He’s funny, sarcastic, spiritual, he likes to make fun of people, and he’s a great guy to have in the team room.”
“I think the younger players had a lot of fun with him this week, which was fun to see.
He does much more than play.”
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows the lead could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a not insignificant advance before the simples of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a painful course.
The Dane played his first game in 1997 at Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros had five points ahead of the Americans, but eventually rose to the top of the leaderboard with the smallest possible gap on the finish line, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You don’t stop to remember that we were leading widely at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we failed, as well as at Valderrama, where we won, but just right,” said Bjorn, after observing the 2018 Rankings lead to victory 5-3 both Friday and yesterday at the National Golf.
"History will prove to me and to all the members of this team that this is not the end.
Go to the bottom tomorrow.
Go in there and do whatever it takes.
It's not over until we get the points on the table.
We have one goal, to try and win this trophy, and that is what we need to stay focused on.
I’ve always said that I’m focused on the 12 players in our camp, but we’re very aware of what’s going on on the other side – they’re the best players in the world.”
Excited about his players’ performances on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never move forward on this point.
Tomorrow, it's another pair of sleeves.
Tomorrow, it will be the individual performances that will be presented and it will be completely different.
It’s fantastic to be with a teammate when things are going well, but when you’re out there on your own, you’re being tested to your full capacity as a golfer.
That’s the message to be conveyed to the players, is to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
When you leave your partner behind, he has to get the best out of himself, too.”
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will try to ensure that his players get better results both individually and as teammates, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Furyk himself experienced both ends of these twists of the last day, after being part of the winning team at Brookline before losing at the end of the "Miracle of Medinah", where Europe ripped the victory.
“I remember every word,” he explains in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had done to rally his players on the last day.
“We have 12 important meetings tomorrow, but you would like to take this quick departure as you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
This dynamic, when it goes in one direction, puts a lot of pressure on the midfield matches.
We established our training accordingly and put the guys as we thought we should do, we’re trying to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas was assigned the task of leading the counterattack and will face Rory McIlroy in the first-class duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the top half of the ranking.
“I accompanied this group of guys in that order because I think it covers the whole course,” Bjorn said of his selections in singles.
Germany's new warship postponed
According to local media, the new German Navy frigate should have been put into service in 2014 to replace aging Cold War-era warships, but it will not be in service until at least next year due to faulty systems and exponential spending.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman, the commissioning of the “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the flagship of the all-new frigates of Baden-Württemberg, was postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the worrisome problems that occurred after delivery compromised the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the Bremen-class aging frigates.
It is certain that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some stealth technologies, such as radar, infrared and reduced acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for a period of up to two years outside the home ports.
According to Die Zeit, however, the relentless delays mean that warships – which should allow Germany to project its overseas force – will already be obsolete when they are put into service.
Last year, the cursed frigate F125 made headlines when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after its delivery.
The reasons for this return were little known, but German media cited a number of "software and hardware flaws" that rendered the warship unnecessary in case of deployment on a combat mission.
Software defects were particularly significant as Baden-Württemberg-class ships would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, which corresponds to half of the crews of old Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it appears that the ship is significantly overloaded, which decreases its performance and reduces the ability of the Navy to make future improvements.
It is estimated that the 7,000-ton “Rheinland-Pfalz” weighs twice as much as the similar-class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Beyond the failures of the computer system, the cost of the project as a whole - including the training of the crew - also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached the astronomical sum of 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion), compared to 2.2 billion initially.
The problems associated with the new frigates are of particular importance in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval strength is declining.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defence committee, acknowledged earlier this year that the Navy is in fact “lack of ships able to deploy.”
The official said the situation had produced a snowball effect over time as the old ships were downgraded but no replacement ships were designated.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust monitors the secret life of bats
New research conducted in an area of the Scottish Highlands seeks to reveal how bats use the landscape in their quest for food.
It is hoped that the observations will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will guide future conservation activities.
The National Trust for Scotland researchers’ study will follow common pipistrels and sopranos as well as long-eared brown bats and Daubenton in the garden of Inverewe in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using portable detectors.
A professional sound analysis will determine the frequency of bat cries as well as the activities of the different species.
A map and a report on habitat will be prepared to provide a detailed picture of their behaviour across the territory.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation adviser for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal the most important areas of habitat for bats and how they are used by each of these species.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the creation of meadows and the best way to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, bat populations have declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development works that affect the perch and result in the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can fly-kill papers and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as pet cat attacks.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, given their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to spot insects and obstacles on their flight paths.
Responsible for the protection of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, the NTS takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, perch inspections and sometimes rescues.
The organization has also established Scotland's first and only bat reserve at the Threave site in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, the domain manager, says the site is the perfect territory for them.
“Here at Threave, we have a great place for bats,” he says.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the right habitat.
But there’s still a lot to learn about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what bats need to thrive.”
He emphasized the importance of checking for bats before proceeding with the maintenance of the properties, because by unintentionally destroying a single maternity nest, one can thus cause the death of 400 females and young, or even the disappearance of an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, disturb them, or destroy their perch.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and as far as many of our species are concerned, we don’t know what’s going on in their populations right now.”
Ronaldo Rejects Rape Charges as Lawyers Prepare to Prosecute German Magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations against him “false information,” and said people “want to get known” by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to prosecute the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus striker was charged with raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He then reportedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Addressing his 142 million fans in a video posted live on Instagram, a few hours after the allegations aired, Ronaldo, 33, called the information “false information.”
“No, no, no, no, and no.
What they said today is false information,” the five-time Ballon d’Or winner told the camera.
“They want to advertise themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” added the player with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over these allegations, which they have called an “inadmissible denunciation of suspicions in the field of privacy.”
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for “moral damages of an amount proportional to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of human rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga apparently returned to the player's room, where an anal rape occurred, according to documents filed with the Clark County Courthouse in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and assured him that he was a "good guy" at "99%" but that he did not know what was going on with the "1%" remaining.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but that they had consented.
Mayorga also claimed to have gone to the police and that photographs of her injuries had been taken in a hospital, but that she had subsequently accepted a settlement amicably because she felt "terrified by reprisals" and feared "to undergo public humiliation".
This 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to cancel this regulation because she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid by leaving Manchester United at the time of this alleged assault, and this summer he joined Italian giant Juve as part of a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million contract.
Brexit: The UK would “forever regret” the departure of automakers.
According to Secretary of State for Trade Greg Clark, the UK “would regret it forever” if it lost its status as the world leader in automotive construction after Brexit.
He added that it was “concerning” that Toyota UK had told the BBC that it would temporarily halt production at its Burnaston plant near Derby if Britain withdrew from the EU without a deal.
“We need an agreement,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis vehicles - built nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other countries in the European Union.
“I believe that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s director at Burnaston.
Other British automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fears of leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade works.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month following Brexit.
The biggest concerns are what automakers call a risk to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is operated in “tense flow”, parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for custom-made vehicles.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be border disruptions that the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep the inventory for more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production would be halted.
According to Clark, Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks.”
"We need an agreement, and we want the best agreement that will allow, as I said, not only to take advantage of the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today.
“The obvious thing, not just from Toyota but from other manufacturers, is that we absolutely have to be able to maintain what turned out to be an excellent set of supply chains.”
Although Toyota was unable to specify how long production would be halted, it warned that in the longer term, additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and end up costing jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, the union’s coordinator at the plant and who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years, said its members were increasingly concerned: “In my experience, once these jobs disappear, they never come back.”
A government spokesman said: “We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU.”
White House Says Trump and Rosenstein Meeting Could Still Be Delayed
According to the White House’s announcement on Sunday, the meeting, which presents important issues, between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “deferred for a week,” while the fight for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, the special adviser tasked with investigating Russian interference in the election, links between Trump’s collaborators and Russia, and possible impediments to justice exercised by the president.
The question of whether or not Trump will dismiss the deputy attorney general, and thus endanger Mueller’s independence, has fueled rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had talked about wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of eliminating the president by the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
However, last Monday, he showed up at the White House while he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not to" expel Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a confrontation with the Senate Judiciary Commission hearing before which Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into complaints against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
On Sunday, Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, made an appearance on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "No date has been set for this, it could be this week, I could see if we can push back another week given all the other things that are happening in the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see and I like to keep the press informed.”
The claim would be disputed by some journalists: Since September 10, Sanders has not held any press conferences at the White House.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the rarity of the lectures was not due to an aversion for the "demagogic" TV reporters, although she said: "I have nothing against the fact that they are stunning the gallery."
Then she suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
Without citing evidence, she added that “the president attends more Q&A sessions than any president before him”: “We checked the numbers.”
There will always be press conferences, Sanders said, but “if the press has the chance to directly question the president of the United States, it’s infinitely better than talking to me.
We’re trying to do it frequently, you’ve seen it well in recent weeks, and it’s going to take the place of a press conference where you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends public meetings or press conferences with dignitaries.
It is rare for him to hold solo press conferences.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, by making a casual appearance and at times a strange appearance in front of the assembled journalists.
On Brexit concerns, Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU officials working within the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude to the country and wish them to remain in office after Brexit.
The Scottish parliamentarian Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to cover the cost of status applications for European citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “During the summer, negotiations on the withdrawal continued between the UK and the EU and are expected to result in decisions this fall.
But the British government has also stepped up its preparations in the event of a no-deal.
I understand that this period must be very troubling for each of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here.”
After suffering a head injury, Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery
Sselon Mike Organ of Tennessee State, Christion Abercrombie, Tennessee Tigers runner-up, was operated on after a head injury Saturday during the Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27 defeat.
Rod Reed, the head coach of the state of Tennessee, told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
“He came on the touch line and collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the touch line before placing it on a stretcher and taking it for another test.
A representative from the state of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the Vanderbilt Medical Center operating room.
Harris said there was "nothing yet to be said about the type or extent of the injury" and that the state of Tennessee was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student athlete, is in his first season with the state of Tennessee after his transfer from Illinois.
He had five total touchdowns on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his total of the season to 18 touchdowns.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty if they purchase property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty if they buy property in the UK and the extra money will be used to help the homeless under the new conservative regimes
This measure will nullify the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury expects to collect up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty rate if they buy a property in the UK - the extra money will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This measure will be seen as an initiative to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters by committing to providing more affordable housing and targeting people earning high incomes.
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional money will be used to strengthen government efforts in the fight to help the homeless.
This surcharge - which comes in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on secondary residences and rental purchases - could reach 3%.
The Treasury expects the project to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
About 13% of new London buildings are purchased by non-residents in the UK, which raises prices and prevents first-time buyers from gaining a place in the housing market.
Many rich areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who mostly stay outside the country.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a reduction in the stamp duty to help more young people acquire a first home.
Accusing major construction companies of keeping real estate prices at a high level by seizing land without using it, he invited Ms. May to renounce affordable housing quotas in order to settle the “real estate disgrace” that is raging in the UK.
Corbyn presented an attractive series of proposals for reform in the housing sector, including the control of rents and the elimination of “no-fault” evictions.
He also wants to give the councils more powers to build new housing.
Mrs May said: “Last year, I declared that I would dedicate my position as Prime Minister to the revival of the British dream – that every new generation would have a better life.
To do this, we need to repair our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and build a life here.
It is, however, unfair that it is as easy for individuals who do not reside in the UK, as it is for foreign companies, to buy a home as it is for hard-working British residents.
For far too many people, the dream of accessing the property has become remote and the misery of the homeless remains too real.”
Jack Ross: My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland.
Sunderland coach Jack Ross says his “ultimate ambition” is to become the Scottish coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is pleased to take up the challenge of reviving the Northeastern club, which currently holds third place in League 1, three points ahead of the leader.
He joined the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren into the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I was selected for Division B and that’s it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportssound.
“But I grew up following Scotland’s matches in Hampden with my father and it’s something I never forgot.
This opportunity, on the other hand, would only arise if I succeed in managing the club.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland coaches are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach says he has not hesitated to put up with such iconic names in such a large club, having already declined Barnsley and Ipswich Town's proposals.
“For me, the success of the moment will be measured in the light of the question ‘can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’
Due to the structure and infrastructure of this club, it undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League,” he added.
"It's not easy to do that, but I would probably only consider myself a success here if I could bring the club back there."
Ross has only three years as a coach, after a period as an assistant at Dumbarton and 15 months as a coach at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa rise from a relegation to the third division and turned St Mirren, who was on the edge of the relegation, into a major championship winner the following season.
Ross is more comfortable now than during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
Alloa’s care “was probably a real crossroads,” he recalls.
“I really thought being a coach was better for me than playing.
It seems strange because I made a good living, I made a good living and I took advantage of some appreciable peaks.
Playing is sometimes difficult.
There are a lot of details to settle every week.
I continue to experience this in terms of stress and tension at work, but being a coach is fine with me.
I’ve always wanted to lead and now I do, I feel more comfortable in my skin than I’ve been in my entire adult life.”

According to a poll, the ideal time for a pint is 17:30 on Saturday.
The heat of the summer has raised the revenues of British pubs in difficulty, but has increased the pressure on the restaurant chains.
The figures indicate that groups of bars and pubs recorded an increase of 2.7% in their sales in July, but revenues in restaurants fell by 4.8.
Peter Martin, of the CGA consulting firm, which compiled the data, said: “The permanent sunshine and longer than expected participation from England in the World Cup led to July following the pattern of June, where bars had experienced a 2.8 per cent increase, except for restaurants, which suffered a further major shock.
The 1.8% decline in June in the catering sector only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars where alcoholic beverages are served are by far the most popular, with more points of resemblance than the restaurants that go down.
Food pubs have also suffered from the effects of the sun, but not as much as restaurateurs.
It seems that people just want to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6% over the month and food decreased by 3%.”
Paul Newman, RSM Leisure and Hospitality Analyst, said: “These results follow the trend observed since late April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that catering groups continue to experience difficulties, although a drop in sales of 4.8% on an annual average is particularly painful, in addition to continuing cost pressures.
The long and hot summer could not have been less opportune for food operators and time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will give a well-deserved rest.”
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in the deployment.
Industry sales are monitored by the Coffer Peach Tracker for the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector, which collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is the industry standard.
On social media, one in five children has secret accounts that they hide from their parents
According to a survey, one in five children - some of whom are only 11 years old - has secret social media accounts that he hides from his parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found an increase in “fake Insta” pages
The news has heightened concerns about the publication of sexual content
20% of students said they had a “main” account to show to their parents
One in five children - some of whom are only 11 years old - opens a social media account that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth of “fake Insta accounts” – a reference to the Instagram photo-sharing site.
The news raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
20% of students reported managing a cleaned “main” account to show it to their parents, while having a private account.
A mother who accidentally fell on the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenager who was inciting others to “rape me.”
According to the study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of young people aged 11 to 18 have a double profile, with half of students acknowledging having private accounts.
WSC Chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that so many teens are tempted to create places online where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will represent the athletes on the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete in athletics and President Ian Beattie has described this choice as an excellent opportunity for the leaders of this sport to take advantage of his extensive experience gained internationally over the past ten years.
"Eilidh has immense respect within the Scottish, British and global athletics community and we are confident that athletics in Scotland would benefit greatly from his participation in the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I really want to be the voice of the athletes and I really want to be able to contribute and guide this sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 1996 200-meter and 400-meter events at the Atlanta Olympics where he won four gold medals and is now a regular BBC commentator, was unable to walk after undergoing a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would recover or how much.
It was a trying job, but I completely recovered, I learned to walk again and today I do agility exercises!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!”
On-line milk-drying advertising that compares mothers and cows divides opinions
An online advertisement from a dairy company compares breastfeeding mothers to cows during milking.
To mark the launch of what is known as the world's first silent milkshake, Elvie, a mainstream technology company, has launched a bold ad inspired by a music video to show the freedom that her new milkshake offers to breastfeeding women.
In a barn filled with hay, four real mothers dance to the rhythm of a song whose lyrics are: “Yes, I betray myself, but you don’t see a tail” and “In case you didn’t notice it, it’s my breasts, not breasts.”
The chorus continues: “Pump it, pump it, I feed the babies, pump it, pump it, pump it, I help the women milking.”
However, the advertisement, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, sparked online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received contradictory reactions from the public, many of whom say it sheds light on the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
“It’s a worse decision than using cows to promote this product.
Just like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken from them in the days following their birth,” one of them wrote.

Another commented: “This is a comprehensible trauma for both the mother and the baby.
But yeah, why not use them to advertise a milkshake for mothers who keep their baby?”
Someone else added: “An advertisement so disconnected.”
Others advocated advertising, for example, a woman admitting she found the song “hilarious.”
“I think it’s an idea of genius.
I would have bought one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pomper gave me the impression of being a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It’s a great product,” someone wrote.
Someone else commented: “It’s a fun advertisement for moms who pull their milk (often in their workplace or at the toilet) and feel like ‘cows’.
It’s not an advertisement that praises the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women reveal having danced with the discreet milkshakers hidden in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use milkshake say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie breast pump is completely silent, without wires or pipes and fits discreetly into a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their baby and even go out while pulling their milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and DPE at Mother, commented: “Elvie Milkshake is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By making a parallel between breastfeeding mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to emphasize the extraction of breast milk and all its challenges, while expressing in a fun and reliable way the incredible sense of freedom that this new breast milk will provide.
This isn’t the first time that Elvie has made the headlines.
During fashion week in London, a mother of two appeared on the podium of designer Marta Jakubowski while she was using this product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Settle Silently in Camp at Texas Border
The number of migrant children detained has increased sharply although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively stable, in part because of the Trump administration’s harsh speeches and policies that have made it difficult for children to be placed in respondents.
Traditionally, most respondents were themselves undocumented immigrants and feared that their own ability to stay in the country would be compromised by taking care of a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential respondents and adult members of their household should submit their fingerprints and that this data would be passed on to immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, testified last week before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency subsequently confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had no criminal record.
“Nearly 80 percent of the people who are respondents or members of their families are here illegally, and many of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we continue to pursue these people,” said Mr. Albence.
According to the shelters, in order to deal more quickly with the case of children, the authorities have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear before the court within a month of their detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the norm previously.
Many of them will appear by video conferencing, rather than in person, to plead their case regarding their legal status before an immigration judge.
Persons deemed ineligible will be expelled promptly.
According to the speakers and the reports that have been presented in recent months by the shelter network, the longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to outbreaks of violence or attempts to flee.
In a large institution like Tornillo, these concerns are exacerbated by the fact that signs that a child is in difficulty are more likely to be neglected because of their size, according to child rights advocates.
They added that moving children to the camp without giving them time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to their friends could accentuate a trauma that many have trouble coping with.
Syria is calling on the US, French and Turkish “occupation forces” to withdraw immediately.
In an address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in that country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they “would be treated accordingly.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem argued that the “war on terrorism is almost over” in Syria, while more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would “continue to carry out this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are purged” from both terrorist groups and any “illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, most of whom are trained and advised by both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
In this war-torn country, France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground.
Moualem said regarding the refugees, that the conditions were favorable for their return, and accused “some Western countries” of “spreading irrational concerns” that deterred the refugees from returning.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to make these returns easier,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have indicated that there will be no support for Syria’s reconstruction until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition aimed at ending this war is concluded.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the latest rebel fortress in Idlib has helped advance political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented a large-scale assault on the province, where three million people live, by Russian-backed Syrian forces.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement provided for “precise deadlines” and expressed hope that the military measures will target jihadists, especially Nusra Front fighters, who are linked to Al-Qaeda and who “will be eliminated”.
UN Representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee bringing together members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution and prepare the way for elections in Syria.
Moualem defined the conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying the group’s work should be limited to “revising the articles of the current constitution,” and issued a warning against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers probably hope, the impeachment and scandal lead him to leave his presidency prematurely.
Which would probably be “The most spectacular finale of a presidency!”
At the moment, the public shows no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, peak hour ratings have more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million on CNN, and have nearly tripled, amounting to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at peak hours, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC’s “Rachel Maddow Show,” which reaches 3.5 million viewers at peak nights, is the first cable television channel.
“It’s an affair that attracts people because it’s not something we understand,” said Neal Baer, host of the ABC drama series Designated Survivor, which talks about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a seasoned comedian and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a few irrefutable truths about slipping into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
She remembers taking a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked him.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Ms. Scovell told me.
Chaos has a playful value.
Obviously, contrary to everything that is happening on television, Washington’s scenarios could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, whether immigrant families can come together and the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most wealthy viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when one finds oneself watching for six hours a panel of experts debate how Bob Woodward used a "deep know-how" for his book "Fear", on the 15,000-dollar ostrich-leather jacket by Paul Manafort ("a clothing filled with extra gold" by Post).
I will never see Super Mario the same way again.
“If part of what he’s doing feels like watching a reality TV show, it’s because he’s making you swallow something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about Trump’s changing teams and day-to-day situational reversals (fighting with the NFL).
We can't afford to miss an episode if we're not behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, he was 26 degrees at home on the north bank of Kauai, but he was crawling inside to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not stand aside, not with Brett Kavanaugh preparing to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
“I remember the time when we were running all these crazy shows and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Money from outside invades tightest mid-term elections
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is flooded with money, thanks to a re-adjustment of the congressional constituencies that allowed two holders to contest the same seat.
This recently restructured suburban district of Pittsburgh is the seat of Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another constituency in the special elections last spring.
Lamb meets another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th District of Pennsylvania, which strongly overlaps the new 17th District.
The maps were redesigned when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former districts were unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district kicked off a confrontation over the funding of electoral campaigns between the major branches of party funding, the Congressional Committee for Democratic Campaign (CCCD) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (CNCR).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a win just last March in a very popular special election in the 18th Pennsylvania Congressional District.
This seat has been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Politologists have given a slight advantage to Democrats.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its support for China, then retreated
Diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which Washington was not opposed to.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the leadership of the Trump Organization.
State Department officials decided to convene the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to protest “their recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” Department of State spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions were only imposed on El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including to control narcotics and provide it with developmental and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, were said to have been painful for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and homicide.
As internal meetings continued, representatives from North and Central America delayed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar meeting that took place last year, seen as a breakthrough in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made clear that they wanted the conference to continue, thus ending any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now speaking at the conference, scheduled for mid-October, to show how important the administration is to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. emissaries quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new messages or severe punishment from Washington.
A spokesman for Mr. Bolton at the White House declined to comment on the details of the debate that were described by the three U.S. dignitaries, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations under the guise of anonymity.
Their statements were corroborated by an independent analyst close to the administration, who also remained anonymous.
Studying the history
The next tile could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on the possible impediment to Trump’s justice. The public record is now supported by substantial evidence.
Mr. Mueller would also direct his investigation to the question of a collusion of Mr. Trump’s campaign with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If Congressional control changes hands, Trump will be held accountable to that body as he prepares to represent himself before the electorate and, perhaps, before a jury composed of his peers.
There are many “ifs”, and I am not claiming that the fall of Mr. Trump is inevitable – nor that of his counterparts in Europe.
We all have decisions to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an impact on the potential duration of this struggle.
In 1938, the German officers were about to organize a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West had stood up to him and pushed the Czechoslovaks to Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these rifts and the inevitable march of democracy accelerates or is delayed.
Americans are currently facing a number of these rifts.
What will we do if Mr. Trump sends the deputy to Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult situation since the newspaper reported that last year it proposed secretly registering the president and hypothesizing his inability to perform his duties.
Rosenstein says the Times report is inaccurate.
“What will we answer if the FBI’s recent inquiry into Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or impartial – or if he is confided in the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimonies?
And above all, are we going to vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we do not succeed in these trials, democracy will spend a long winter.
But I am convinced that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz under the Nazi regime, which in the past occupied my ambassadorial residence.
She survived, immigrated to America and, sixty years later, sent me to light sabbath candles on the swastika table.
With this legacy, I can’t be optimistic about our future.”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, confident against the Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will receive the Rapid Vienna on Thursday, while knowing that the victory against the Austrians, following the impressive zero match in Spain against Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will place them in a strong position to qualify for Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury deprived midfielder Graham Dorrans of his first participation of the season until the 2:2 draw against Villarreal, but he is convinced that the Rangers are able to make the best of such a result to achieve feats.
“It was a positive point for us, because Villarreal is a quality team,” the 31-year-old said.
“We got into the game thinking we could get something and we left with a point.
We might have won in the end, but on the whole, a zero match was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came back in the second half and we were the best team.
Thursday is another important European evening.
With a little luck, we can hope to get three points, but it will be a difficult match because they did a good result in their last match, however I am sure we can continue and get a positive result with the crowd behind us.
“Last year was really tough, between my injuries and the changes I made to the club as such, but there’s a satisfaction factor about this place now.
The team is good and the guys have a lot of fun; the training is quality.
Let’s hope we can move forward now, leave last season behind and win.”
Women no longer find sleep because of this fear about their retirement savings
Although the participants in this survey were clearly aware of how they wanted to be cared for, few people discussed the issue with their family members.
Nearly half of those who participated in the national study said they were talking to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they spoke to their children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t do what’s necessary to have this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to provide care for you if you don't communicate your wishes well in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to determine where and how you can receive care, as these options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor is also able to help you establish a way to pay these fees.
Your long-term care financing decisions may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a buy-back hybrid life insurance policy to help you cover these expenses, or other insurance on your estate - provided you have the means to insure it.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles in the process.
Provide a health care proxy that will allow you to designate a trusted person who will check your medical care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also consider a power of attorney regarding your financial resources.
You would choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and make sure you pay your bills if you are struck with disability.
Think of the small details: Suppose your elderly parent has a medical emergency and goes to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
List these details in a written document to be well prepared.
“It’s not just the finances that are at stake, but who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Put this plan in place.”
A man was repeatedly injured with a compressed air gun in Ilfracombe
A man received several shots fired with a compressed air gun as he was walking home from a party.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police described the incident, which took place around 2:30 a.m. BST, as a "random act".
The victim didn't see her aggressor.
His injuries do not threaten his life and the police have launched a call for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, and the balance sheet is expected to tighten.
As communications were paralyzed, emergency services were unable to receive any information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicentre of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated following the disaster.
Some essential facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that runs more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The population of the Regency, an administrative region located below a province, was estimated at 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of central Sulawesi province, and especially of the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also an important activity in the province, but it is mainly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis on several occasions over the past century, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck west of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic fire circle of the Pacific and is regularly shaken by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh triggered a tsunami in 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: Several violent earthquakes rocked the west coast of Sumatra from late March to early April.
A few hundred people died on the island of Nias, off Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake shook the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake devastated one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, triggering a more than 10m tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake shook the Regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, reminding residents of the devastation caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was caused this time, but more than 100 people were killed in the collapse of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes shook the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The quake destroyed several thousand buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, a 29-year-old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, violating a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a statement released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he reportedly took the phone from a female acquaintance who was trying to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is being held in pre-trial detention at the Mat-Su Pre-trial Detention Center and is being held on an unsecured $500 bond, KTUU said.
He appeared in court on Saturday, declaring himself "not guilty, that's for sure" when his advocacy was asked, the network said.
Palin faces three Class A offences, which means he could be sentenced to imprisonment for up to one year and is liable to a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B minor offence, punishable by one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted police to report the alleged assault.
The case is pending in the Veterans Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, meddling in the report of a crime of domestic violence and possession of a drunken gun in connection with the incident.
His wife claimed that he had hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016 after making the link between her son’s violent behavior and PTSD resulting from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died as a result of the earthquake that shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and ravaged thousands of homes.
The electricity and telecommunications networks are down and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake occurred just off the centre of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos broadcast on social media show the point of impact.
Several hundred people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu at the time the tsunami broke out on the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Call for Rare Death Penalty for Person Suspected of Terrorist Attack in New York
New York prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the alleged New York assailant who killed eight — a rare sentence that has not been enforced in that state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a truck rented from Home Depot to attack a bike lane on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, mowing on his pedestrian and cyclist road last October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will need to provide evidence that Saipov “intentionally” murdered the eight victims and inflicted “intentionally” serious bodily harm, according to the statement of intent to seek capital punishment filed with the Southern District of New York.
Both of these charges are likely to result in the death penalty, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury convicted Saipov of 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for extortion of funds, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and one for crimes of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “deliberate preparation and premeditation,” prosecutors said, calling Saipov’s method “hateful, cruel and depraved.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferrutionchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” the statement said.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The Southern District of New York had not claimed the death penalty in prosecution for ten years.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug traffickers but was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a New York federal case was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed for engaging in conspiracy and espionage for the USSR during the two years following the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the tragedy, according to court documents.
According to police, he told investigators that he was happy with his actions.
Saipov told authorities he was incited to commit the attack after watching videos of Daesh on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to display the flag of Daesh in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "obviously disappointed" by the decision to pursue prosecution.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept his plea of guilt and sentence him to life in prison without the possibility of release can only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all concerned,” Patton said.
The Saipov defense team had already asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today to “mobilize the popular army” at a rally at the Conservatives’ conference.
The former UK Independence Party said politicians should "feel the pressure" of eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's MPs suggested, he should be tasked with negotiating with the EU.
Backbench Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham march that the UK “would have already been freed” if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But the dilemma that Mrs May is facing to reconcile her deeply divided troops has been underscored by the Conservatives for the idea of staying in the Union who joined an isolated anti-Brexit demonstration in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain his Chequers compromise plan despite threats from those who want to leave and those who want to stay as well as from the EU.
The Allies stressed that it would continue its attempts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite hostilities - and would force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its agenda and "chaos."
Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to “get rid of Chequers.”
He felt that Mr Farage should have become a partner and been entrusted with the task of negotiating with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have gone out already,” he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: “I will defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers.”
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he continued: “We have not surrendered to world wars to submit.
We want to make our own legislation in our own homeland.”
Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have turned the page and want to stay is completely false.”
Conservative Andrea Jenkyns, a supporter of the exit, was also present at the march and told reporters: “I’m just saying, Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is not appreciated by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, this is also the case of our party and our activists who walk the streets and make us elect first and foremost.
Give up checks and start listening.”
In a message to Mrs. May, she added: Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
“Mr. Farage told the rally that politicians should be led to ‘feel the pressure’ if they were about to betray the decision that was made as part of the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
They’re trying to cheat Brexit and we’re telling them today: “We’re not going to let you get away with it.”
He added in a message to the enthusiastic crowd: “I want you to feel the pressure on our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that allowed us to win the Brexit victory and we will not stop until we have become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, pro-European supporters marched across Birmingham before organizing a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists have branded conservative banners against Brexit after the group launched this weekend.
His Labour counterpart Lord Adonis ridiculed the Conservatives because of the security issues surrounding the party's implementation at the start of the conference.
“They are the ones who assure us that they are able to put in place the IT systems and all the technology for Canada, plus, for the frictionless border, for the borderless free trade in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a real farce.
A good Brexit does not exist,” he added.
Warren intends to seriously consider the possibility of running for president.
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat discussed her future on Saturday at a public meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a voice often critical of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, a GOP representative in the states, who co-chaired the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was at the center of speculation that she could face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters as part of a public assembly since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she intended to run for president.
Warren responded that the time had come “for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, which implies having a woman head of state.”
Arrested in the Shooting of Sims at Louisiana State University
On Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced that a suspect had been arrested in connection with the shooting death of Wayde Sims, an LSU basketball player, on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department participated in the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11:00 a.m.
On Friday, they released a video of the shooting, asking for help in identifying a man who appeared on the images.
Sims, 20, was shot dead Friday morning near the Southern University campus.
“Wayde Sims received a bullet wound to the head and succumbed to his injuries,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told 247 sports on Saturday.
Wayde took his friend's defense and was shot by Simpson.
Asked, Simpson admitted to being on the scene, possessing a gun, and shooting at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in custody at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims, a 2m youth who grew up in Baton Rouge, has played 32 games, including 10 as a starter last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton heads for the world title after the team's guidelines allowed him to win the victory against Sebastian Vettel
It quickly became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton last Saturday that the Mercedes team's instructions would play an important role in the competition.
From pole position, Bottas took a good start and cornered Hamilton on the flank as he defended his place in the first two laps, and invited Vettel to attack his team-mate.
Vettel entered the stands first and left Hamilton to throw himself into the turmoil at the queue of the peloton, which should have been a decisive element.
The Mercedes went through the stands a lap later and was behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead after a wheel-to-wheel action that saw the Ferrari driver reluctantly leave the interior at the risk of resisting after a double defensive attempt in the third corner.
Max Verstappen left the last line of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first round to celebrate his 21st birthday.
He then dominated much of the race while keeping his tires to aim for a speed finish and ahead Kimi Raikkonen in fourth place.
He eventually reached the stands in the 44th round, but was unable to accelerate the pace in the remaining eight laps, with Raikkonen ranking fourth.
It's a tough day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me pass.
The team did an outstanding job to get a one-two,” Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
At a meeting last Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein, who stressed that she had not disclosed Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but he argued that the events taking place in the Senate showed that people were “bad, disgusting and dishonest.”
“The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that’s happening in the Senate these last days, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and disgusting and dishonest,” he said.
“Seeing the disclosures and leaks, they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you divulge any information?
Remember his answer... did you divulge information - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no.
I didn't disclose anything."
Well, wait a minute.
We have disclosed information... No, we have not disclosed information,” he added, thinking of the senator’s impression.
Feinstein received a letter last July from Ford detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh, and the disclosure took place in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t disclose his story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She told me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked me to.”
But his denial does not seem to be well received by the president, who commented Saturday night at the rally: "I'll tell you, it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, accused of sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that Democrats were using these allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by all means.
You see the meanness, the pettyness, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control,” the president told Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars cleared their Elite League defeat to the Belfast Giants on Friday by scoring a 5-3 return to Dundee last Saturday.
The Giants opened the score with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the tie before Dwyer returned the lead to the Giants.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals, securing them victory.
It was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's players, who had beaten Dundee 2-1 Friday night in Belfast, after being caught up.
This was the fourth confrontation of the season between the two sides, with the Giants triumphing in the last three games.
Dwyer gave the lead in the fourth minute, at 3:35, thanks to a pass from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford served Beauvillier who doubled the bet four minutes later.
During a busy first period, Sullivan restarted the local team at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt joined Cownie at 15:16, with a draw.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before the first pause when he hit his second goal of the evening towards the end of the first period.
The local team gathered and Bouchard again equalized with a goal giving a numerical advantage at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen put Dundee at the top for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, securing victory for his team by scoring a fifth goal in the middle.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will welcome Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller has died helping hundreds of people on a plane escape from the quake.
An Indonesian air traffic controller is hailed as a hero after he died ensuring a plane carrying hundreds of people could safely take off.
More than 800 people have died and many others have been missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi last Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to ravage the region and large numbers of people are trapped under rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite the flight of his colleagues, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, refused to give up his post in the violently shaken tower at Palu’s Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport.
He stayed there to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he felt it collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the move could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We mobilized a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“Our hearts are broken to learn that,” he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, with the country's disaster prevention agency saying access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The stockpile would continue to increase as many bodies were still under the rubble and a large number could not be rescued,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency’s spokesman.
Waves measuring up to six meters ravaged Palu which will celebrate a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide aid and food supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance brings back bodies.
Clean water is rare.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is running to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they’re going to find.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country’s military: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?” said CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a man has disappeared after a plane crashed in the lagoon.
The airline that operated the flight that crashed into a Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia now claims a man is missing after the 47 passengers and crew safely evacuated the plane that was in the air.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon, it was unable to find traces of a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more specific information about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats participated in the rescue of the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said on Saturday that six passengers were still in the hospital, and that they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events remain uncertain.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon near the runway.
Witnesses said the plane had overtaken the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had arrived too low.
“That’s a very good thing,” said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the others could have slipped into the water until the rescue exits of the sinking plane.
He claimed that the flight attendants had panicked and screamed, and that he was suffering from a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy claimed that sailors working nearby to improve a dock had also participated in the rescue using a pneumatic boat to transport people to land before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicate that 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none concerned Air Niugini.
The analyst presents the chronology of the night when the woman was burned alive
The indictment adjourned its case Saturday in the trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used phone records from a cell phone to trace the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he had obtained location data from several mobile phones that indicated that Tellis was meeting with Chambers on the night of his death, which contradicted his previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers while he had claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak to Sanford.
Sanford appeared at the bar on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s truck that night, Sanford replied that he was “lieing because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency is that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The phone records show that they had known each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact details from his phone.
“He wiped her out of her life,” Hale said.
The defense must begin its pleadings on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be held before the jury during the day.
The High Breed: What is political hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative vision of the genre by imbuing their music with positive messages.
Bristol's The High Breed claims that hip hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and social issues.
The band wants to reconnect with its roots and make political hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have experienced a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York nanny sues couple for firing after 'racist' text
A New York-based nanny sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message from the mother who complained that she was “still a Black”.
The couple refuses to be racist, and assimilates prosecutions to “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, expressed her dismay at the fact that Giselle Maurice, the new nanny, was Black when she arrived for her first day at work.
“NOOOOOOOOOOOON ONE NORTHERN,” Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in an SMS.
Yet, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Ms. Maurice.
According to the New York Post, Plasco-Flaxman, after understanding her “uncomfortable” gaze, sent Ms. Maurice away, explaining that their former nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she was rather expecting a Filipino.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a day’s work and then sent home by an Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple in order to obtain compensation under his dismissal and is claiming a compensation of $350 per day under the six-month home service for which he was initially hired, but without a contract.
“I want to make them understand, listen, we’re not doing that kind of thing,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to allegations of racism by saying it was reasonable to end Maurice's employment, fearing that he might not be trusted after being harmed.
“My wife sent him something she didn’t want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you entrust your children to someone you were rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn?
Let's see!"
Assimilating the trial to an “extortion,” Plasco said his wife was only two months away from having a baby and was in a “very delicate situation.”
“Would you pursue someone like that?
It’s not a very pleasant thing to do,” added the business banker.
While the case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion did not hesitate to denounce the couple on social media, blaming them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers fear readers won’t identify with a talking bear, new letter reveals
Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter, born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads it for the first time before it’s published.
It’s a lot of fun, knowing what we know about Paddington’s huge success.”
She said her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the children's book inspired by a little teddy bear, would have remained optimistic about the rejection of his work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books had had a "sweet-bitter" flavor after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important member of our family", and adds that her father was very proud of his final success.
“He was a fairly calm man, and he wasn’t a pretentious one,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who succeeds in something: we’re proud of him, even if it’s not really his own accomplishment.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it is his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he has always attributed the merit to Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
On landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried everything to save her life.
“Nad was calling regularly to explain how bad the situation was, we didn’t expect her to get away with it,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then Nad called me to warn me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, darling.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors had given her to maintain her heart rate were slowly depleting and coming out of her system.
She died a while ago and everything stopped.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was going on.
I couldn’t cry or cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep up.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, in mourning for her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, without caring about the ordeal she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I had my head down, and I was crying all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this immense sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women in mourning deposit postcards to prevent suicides on bridges.
Two women who have lost loved ones by suicide are trying to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted postcards on a Welsh bridge containing inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Davis’ son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I’m forced to feel on a daily basis,” she said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising leader with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that her smile lit up any room.”
However, he quit his job before he died, as he was “in a very dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old brother found his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis said, "I'm constantly afraid there's a training effect."
Ms. Davis created the maps “to let people know that there are people you can go see and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t be silent – you have to talk.”
Ms. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Ms. Davis, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother’s death.
“He didn’t say he felt shot down, depressed or anything,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed his change of attitude.
It was at its lowest on Christmas Day – when the kids opened their presents, he had no eye contact with them or anything.”
She said her death had been a huge trauma for them, but they have to get away with it: “It’s tearful for the family.
It destroys us.
But we all have to go ahead and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I thought if we could get something like what he was asking for - a time-limited investigation, limited in its scope - we might be able to bring some unity," Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would "crash" into a partisan impasse.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of the moment.
If, as expected, Republicans score poorly, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators, asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and met, through him, his wife Ashley, who was his personal secretary at the time.
What will happen after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
We do not yet know whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to pre-empt the vote and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
North Korea: Number of deserters 'fall' under Kim's leadership
The number of North Korean deserters to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un's rise to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern Unification Ministry, said 1,127 desertions took place last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Park said strengthening border controls between North Korea and China and increasing tariffs demanded by smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean deserters will eventually be granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ), located between the two Koreas.
China regards deserters as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South - which are technically still at war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang as part of talks focused on the denuclearization negotiations that had remained pending until then.
This came after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, broadly speaking, to work for a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions on the lack of progress since then.
“In the absence of confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances it is excluded that we will be the first to operate unilateral disarmament,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and says he’s unfit to sit in Supreme Court
Pelosi, the leader of the parliamentary minority, called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to sit on the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made these comments as part of an interview given Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had behaved this way, they would have treated her as "hysterical," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional and at times almost screamed and choked about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations about him a “grotesque and coordinated assassination” organized by disillusioned liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that according to her, Kavanaugh's testimony demonstrated that he was unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, as he showed he was against the Democrats.
“I think he’s discrediting himself with these statements and the way he’s dealt with Clinton and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to oust Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats got a majority in the House of Representatives.
“If he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he’s not only unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, but he’s also unfit to sit in the courtroom where he’s currently sitting,” Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge in the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi also added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, since he is considered a conservative judge.
During his confirmation hearings, Mr. Kavanaugh avoided the question of the possible reversal of certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time for a hysterical and biased person to go to court and expect what we were saying, ‘Isn’t that wonderful,’” Pelosi said.
And women need to use it.
It is a legitimate diatribe, months and years of anger that overflow, and it cannot get it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s rare, and you?”
“I was greatly helped by a woman who was framed somewhere, who told me that she was also crying when she got angry, but she developed a technique that allowed her to tell the person she was talking to, when she was getting angry and crying, ‘You can think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she continued.
And I found it brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger, in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most striking memories of a first job, in a male-dominated office, where I found myself one day crying with inexpressible rage, was that I had been seized by the skin of my neck by an old woman - a cold manager who always had me a little frightened - who had me in a staggering position.
“Don’t let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’re glad they got you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential election.
In 1987, while Mr. Hart had been caught in an extramarital affair aboard a boat called Monkey Business and had retired from the campaign, Ms. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, said there was no reason for her not to explore the idea of running for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me, laughing, 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the running, and the last thing they were missing was one more person.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
As the campaign was very advanced, it had lagged behind in fundraising, and so swore that it would not participate unless it raised $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She learned that some of her supporters who usually gave $1,000 to men only intended to give her $250.
“Do they think I’m entitled to a discount?” she asked.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so upset by her emotions - the gratitude for the people who had supported her, the frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters rather than delegates, and the anger against sexism - that she is.
“You would have thought I was having a nervous breakdown,” recalled Mrs. Schroeder about the reaction of the press to her.
“You would have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they were going to put on my tombstone.
“She was crying?”
How the U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The first salvos of the trade war between the US and China have been deafening, and while the battle is far from over, a disagreement between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest increase this week came with new tariffs affecting items worth US$200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), taxing half of all goods from China arriving in the United States.
Each time, Beijing has retaliated in kind, striking recently tariffs of 5-10% on $60 billion of US goods.
China is committed to equalizing the United States, and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will vacillate anytime soon.
To push Washington back is to yield to the demands, but to publicly yield to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Experts believe, however, that if Beijing can properly play its role, the pressures of the US trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions conducive to an economic slowdown in either country is actually much more dangerous than what observers have previously acknowledged,” Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia, told the think tank at the Center for New American Security.
Syria 'prepared' for return of refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria declares its readiness for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild this country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All conditions are now met for the voluntary repatriation of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have deserted the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid for the reconstruction of this devastated country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept conditional aid or assistance from the countries that sponsored the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating the US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the National Golf near Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the title when the team of the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn crossed the bar of 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who was in trouble for most of the tournament, plunged his starting shot into the water at the 16th hole in par-3, ceding his duel to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of four players to have ever reached 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament, the first edition of which dates back to 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5-4 by the least-placed player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark.
The best golfer in the world, Dustin Johnson, bowed 2 and 1 against Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran of eight Ryder Cups, the Spaniard Sergio Garcia became the European champion of all time with a total of 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today it’s stronger than me.
It was a busy year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
What matters is the team, and I'm happy to have been able to help him," Garcia said with emotion after the European victory.
He passes the torch to fellow golfer John Ram, who beat American golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in a single last Sunday.
“I feel incredible pride, having beaten Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy,” said Rahm, 23.
Woods has lost his four games in France and now holds a 13-21-3 career record in the Ryder Cup.
A surprising statistic for one of the greatest golfers of all time, who picked up 14 major titles, just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find the fairways, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top-level golf throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk commented after a disappointing performance about his team: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we had a certain moment when we put pressure on Europe.
We gave up.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We're going to come together, I'm going to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
We have to bow.
We have been overtaken.”
Tide information point Red: Lower concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report by the Florida Fisheries and Wildlife Commission indicates a general decrease in red tide concentrations in certain areas of the Tampa Bay region.
According to the CPF, more irregular flowering conditions are reported in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties - raising concerns about declining concentrations.
The red tide covers about 209 km (130 miles) of coastline, from north of Pinellas to south of the counties of Lee.
