USA Gymnastics supports the U.S. Olympic Committee’s letter and recognizes the absolute need for the Olympic community to strive to create a safe environment for all of its athletes.
We agree with what the USOC has said, namely that the interests of our athletes and our clubs, and their sports, can be better served by bringing about significant change within our organization, and not by decertification.
USA Gymnastics has promoted an independent investigation to understand how it was possible that an abuse of the dimensions described so courageously by those who managed to survive Larry Nassar remained hidden for so long, and is willing to implement any necessary or appropriate change.
USA Gymnastics and USOC have the same goal: to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible, so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a reliable, positive and accountable environment.

This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widespread, but provides greater details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the feathering of this animal was brown chestnut at the top, with a pale coloration or carotenoid at the bottom.
The discovery also provides detailed information on the evolution of bird feathers.
Since the dinosaur feathering is not equipped with the basic structure, the so-called spine, but instead has other characteristics typical of feathers, beards and beards, the researchers concluded that the spine is probably the result of evolutionary development subsequent to such characteristics.
The structure of the feathering suggests that it was not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or courtship. The researchers hypothesize that, while it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the find shows an adult feathering and not the chick duvet.
According to the researchers, despite the tail belonging to a young dinosaur, the sample reveals an adult specimen feathering and not that of a chick.

Brightness is used in conjunction with rotation to define the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the flow of plasma.
The lower Rossby's number, the lower the star's activity compared to magnetic reversals.

The activity was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect sought by the team was to be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of this galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a force of attraction on Earth that generates tides, so does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to deduce that the effects of dark matter on other dark matter are the same effects that "normal" matter has.
This theory holds that much of the dark matter around a galaxy is collected in a halo species, formed by a multitude of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll has identified extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal.
According to a statement released in an interview, this new variant was "highly worrying and alarming, due to the high mortality rate."
According to Dr. Moll, some patients may have contracted the microbe inside the hospital, and at least two of them were health workers at the hospital itself.
Over the course of a year, an infected person can become infected with 10 to 15 close contacts.

Glen Cushing of the team of astrogeologists at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona, said: “Their thermal behavior is not constant like that of large terrestrial caves, which often maintain a relatively stable temperature, but is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground.”
In France, voting is traditionally an untechnical experience: voters enter an isolated booth and put in an envelope a pre-printed sheet indicating the chosen candidate.
After verification of his identity by the officials, the voter deposits the envelope in the ballot box and signs the electoral register.

Since 1988 the polls must be transparent, so that voters and observers can testify that at the beginning of the vote there are no envelopes and that no other envelopes are inserted than those of the voters, duly counted and authorized.
Candidates can send their representatives to assist at every stage of the process. In the evening, volunteers carry out the calculation of votes under strict control, in accordance with specific procedures.

Huhne has resigned and will be replaced in government by Ed Davey MP. Norman Lamb MP is expected to fill the role of Minister for Enterprise left vacant by Davey.
Huhne and Pryce are scheduled to appear in Westminster magistrates' court on February 16.
The victims were 25-year-old Nicholas Alden and 21-year-old Zachary Cuddeback.
Edgar Veguilla has reported injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider will undergo facial reconstruction surgery.
Uka's weapon did not explode when it was pointed at the head of a fifth man. Schneider has constant pain, is blind from one eye, he is missing a section of the skull and his face has been reconstructed in titanium.
Schneider testified via videoconference from a USAF base in his country.
In addition to the event on Wednesday, Carpanedo participated in two individual competitions of the Championships.
The first in the slalom, where on the first descent he recorded a DNT. Another 36 out of 116 competitors in the same race did not finish the test.
The other race in which she participated, the giant slalom, saw her place tenth in the women's group in the "sitting" category, with a combined running time of 4:41.30, slower by 2:11.60 minutes than the first-place finisher, the Austrian Claudia Loesch, and slower by 1:09.02 minutes than the ninth-place finisher of the Gy ungye.
Four women's group skiers failed to finish their descents, and 45 of the 117 participants in the Giant Slalom did not qualify in the race.
Police in Madhya Pradesh managed to retrieve the laptop and mobile phone that had been stolen.
Deputy Inspector General DK Arya said: “Five people have been arrested for the rape of the Swiss woman and we have also recovered her cell phone and her laptop.”
The names of the defendants are: Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
None of the three people who were in the house at the time of the car crash were injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The road on which the accident occurred was temporarily closed, while emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the Sheriff's Court of Edinburgh on charges of killing her own son.
She is being held awaiting trial and trial, but any testimony given by an eyewitness could be polluted, as her image has been widely published.
This is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scottish justice has other parameters. The Scottish courts have considered the publication of the photos potentially harmful.
According to Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee, “journalists who publish photos or other suspicious subjects walk on a minefield.”
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for legal proceedings, has told reporters that no new comments will be released until at least the formal indictment.
According to leaks, the document will focus on the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on existing borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
According to what is said, the other issues addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement is signed, Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to abandon that presence only for five years.
The shooters within the experimental program for pest control had to be closely monitored by rangers, since the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association, the NPWS in collaboration with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., recruited qualified volunteers.
According to Mick O’Flynn, acting director of the NPWS Park Conservation and Heritage, the four shooters chosen for the first shooting operation received comprehensive training and safety instructions.
Yesterday Martelly was sworn in to a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) consisting of nine members.
This is Martelly’s fifth provisional election council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission proposed a package of measures to push the country towards new elections, including the resignations of the previous CEP.
The committee constituted Martelly's response to the widespread protests, which began in October, that challenge the regime.
The occasional violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which had been planned since 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating of malfunctioning iPods were reported, which caused a total of six fires and caused minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 device-related incidents.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that it had been informed by Apple of another 34 overheating-related incidents, which the company called "not serious".
In its response, the ministry called Apple’s deferral of the report “absolutely deplorable.”
The quake in the Mariana Islands was reported at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office, no damage has been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there were no signs of a tsunami.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Philippine police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus.
With his M16 rifle Rolando Mendoza set fire to tourists.
Many of the hostages have been rescued, at least six have died.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were immediately released along with Filipino photographers.
The photographers then replaced themselves with an elderly lady who needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza was hit to death.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began his medical career.
After completing her obstetrics training, she began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While serving in the hospital, in his free time, Liggins began to study cases of premature labor.
His research showed that the administration of a hormone would accelerate the maturation of the lungs in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday recovered two "black boxes" with flight records.
His wrestling comrades also wanted to pay tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Moon was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. She died on the night of the two moons. Unique, just like her. A strong woman."
“Moon was weird like me... Maybe even more... I love her and I’ll miss her... We hope she’s in a better place,” Dustin “Goldust” Runnels commented.
According to the survey of 1,400 people conducted before the 2010 federal elections, people opposed to Australia’s move to the republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard said she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
This opinion is shared by 34% of poll participants, according to which Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
Contrary to the survey, 29% of respondents said Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% said it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist should have competed in the 100 and 200 metres freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but has accused several disorders that have led to doubts about his fitness.
He could not take the necessary drugs to overcome the pain because they are banned from the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest first number ever known to date.
The discovery was verified by several people through the use of various hardware and software in early February, and was announced Tuesday.
Comets may have been one of the sources that brought water and organic matter to Earth, that is, matter capable of forming proteins and supporting life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form and in particular how the Earth formed, having collided with comets a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, has been in office since the beginning of this year as governor; last month he put his signature on a law that makes same-sex marriage legal.
According to him, the speculations are nothing more than "talk and political idiocy".
A presidential candidacy is expected in 2016.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system would allow aircraft to cover shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel per year, thereby reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
The system uses satellite technology rather than obsolete ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and provide pilots with more accurate information.
Additional transportation is not being arranged and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, while car parking or interchange parking is not available on site.
Fears related to the absence of means of transport have led to the possibility of having the game necessarily played behind closed doors, without the support of the fans of the team.
According to a study published Thursday in the journal Science, a new species of birds was born on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
According to researchers at the University of Princeton, USA, and the University of Uppsala, Sweden, the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that the time required for this process was much longer; this was due to the coupling between an endemic Darwin's squirrel, Geospiza fortes, and the squirrel's squirrel.
Gold can be worked in any shape. It can be rolled up to create tiny shapes.
It can be pulled to form a thin wire, suitable for twisting and braiding. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. Sometimes it was used to decorate the hand-painted images in the books called "miniature codes" precisely thanks to the possibility of being made so thin.
This is the so-called pH of the substance. Using red cabbage juice it is possible to build a pH indicator.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical element is.
The pH level of the analyzed chemical is given by the amount of hydrogen ions present (the letter H of pH).
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been torn away (since hydrogen atoms are formed by a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dried powders together and then, with clean and wet hands, put them into a ball.
Between the moisture present on your hands and the outer layers will trigger a reaction that will cause a strange feeling and form a kind of shell.
Almost all houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a bathroom with running water equipped with a connection to an advanced sewer system.
In Greece, in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, remains of sewage networks have been discovered.
Cabinets in antiquity also existed in Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization they were sometimes placed in public toilets, attended by a mixed audience of men and women.
To call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then sends it back almost instantly.
The launch of the satellite into space was made with a rocket. Scientists resort to space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts light and visuals.
To carry a satellite or a telescope into space, a rocket more than 100 feet high is required.
The wheel has changed the world enormously. Among the various advantages it has offered us, the most important one is to have provided us with simpler and faster transportations.
Thanks to his invention, they made their appearance the train, the car and several other means of transport.
Below them are other medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic cats at large) that feed on small prey, significantly more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The concept of niche is the secret of their success, a particular goal that every feline has and that allows him not to compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live in numerous groups called rays.
The branches are composed of adult males, usually 2 or 3 related to each other, and a number of females and puppies that can reach 30.
Usually the females are closely related to each other, being a large family of daughters and sisters.
The pack of lions acts in a very similar way to the pack of wolves or dogs, whose behavior is in fact surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not that of other large felines), even with regard to deadly attacks on their prey.
A complete athlete: the tiger is able to climb (though not too well), swim, make very long jumps and exert a tensile force five times greater than that of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same family (the genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard and jaguar. These four cats are the only ones to roar.
The roar of the tiger is not as powerful as that of the lion, but rather resembles a phrase of screaming and angry words.
Ocelots love to feed on small animals. If possible, they go hunting for monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds and almost all the prey they catch are much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find the animals to eat (pred) thanks to the smell, sniffing to the ground where they have been.
Thanks to night vision they are able to see very well in the dark, as well as being able to move stealthily. To hunt their prey, the ocelots mimic the surrounding environment and then float on it.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population to which they belong (for example, if they move beyond a mountain range or river, or move to a new island, thus making it difficult to return), they will probably find themselves in a different environment from the one in which they were before.
This new environment is characterized by different resources and competitors, so in order to position itself as a strong competitor, the new population will need different characteristics or transformations from those previously needed.
The original population has not changed at all; it continues to need the same adaptations as before.
As time passes and as the new population adapts to its new environment, it becomes less and less like the other population.
At some point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different from each other that they can no longer be defined as belonging to the same species.
This process, which consists in the formation of new species, is called speciation. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and is a fundamental element of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that is inhaled by humans and absorb the carbon dioxide expelled by them (through exhalation).
Plants process their own nourishment with the sun through photosynthesis. They also shade.
We build our homes from plants and produce clothes with plants. Much of the food we eat is made of plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the superpredator of his era and therefore feared nothing but the other mosasaurs.
More than 70 sharp razor-like teeth emerged from his long jaws, plus an additional row located on the palate, so there was no escape for anyone who crossed his path.
We do not know for sure, but it is possible that he had a forked tongue. His feeding included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs and it is also possible that he was a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex could not compete with him.
Although much of their food would seem familiar to us, the Roman banquets also provided for different strange or unusual ranges, such as the boar, the peacock, the snails and a species of rodent called the giro.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate sitting on the chairs, the rich men liked to feast together while lying on one side while consuming their meal.
Of course, the meals of the ancient Romans did not include several foods, coming to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built for each deity a main temple, which was considered the dwelling place of the god.
People sacrificed to the gods and priests sought to provide for the needs of the gods through ceremonies and feasts.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an internal sanctuary accessible only to priests.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers were built, called ziggurats, which became part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a sanctuary dedicated to the god.
Due to the mild climate that characterizes the Middle East, the house was not of fundamental importance.
Much of the life of the Jewish family took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard, while the shops were simple outdoor counters overlooking the street. The stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so wood was particularly expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Nordic sagas it is said that it was Erik the Red who gave it its name, having met Greenland on his journey after being exiled from Iceland for murder.
But, regardless of its discovery, at that time the Eskimo tribes already lived there.
Although all countries were "Scandinavian", the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland had very different characteristics.
If you’ve seen the movie “The Mystery of the Templars,” you might think that a treasure map is drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is false. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is the inscription "Original Declaration of Independence of 4 July 1776". The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although it is not known for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence the large paper of parchment (measured 29.75 inches by 24.5 inches) was rolled up to be stored.
Probably, therefore, the annotation was intended only as a label.
The D-Day landings and the clashes that followed had led to the liberation of northern France, but the south was still occupied.
It was ruled by the Vichy regime, that is, by those French who in 1940 had made peace with the Germans and had allied themselves with the invaders, instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France: this offensive action took the name of "Operation Dragoon".
The American and Free French forces had liberated southern France in just two weeks and were heading for Germany.
Civilization means a specific culture, shared by a significantly broad group of people who live and work collaboratively, constituting a society.
The word civility comes from the Latin "civilis", which means civil; the term is in turn associated with "civis", i.e. citizen, and "civitas", i.e. city or city-state, and in a certain way defines the size of society.
The city-states are the first realities to anticipate the idea of a nation. Culture of civilization means transmitting knowledge through several generations, leaving an indelible cultural imprint through a fair spread.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical traces, thus not being recognized as real civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states formed for the first time a weak central government, and Congress was the only component of it, according to the Statute of the Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes and, given the absence of an executive or judicial power at the national level, relied on state authorities, often uncooperative, for the application of its own acts.
He did not even have the authority to bypass tax laws and tariffs between states.
In order to amend the articles, the unanimous consent of all the states was necessary, which, on their part, had so little regard for the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German national team, is the second most successful football team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the most popular sports are: football, basketball, volleyball, volleyball, volleyball, screen, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, track hockey and Formula 1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most prevalent in the northern regions and see Italians engaged in competitions in international competitions and Olympic events.
There are almost 7,000 islands in Japan (the largest is Honshu), and this makes Japan the seventh largest archipelago in the world!
From a geographical point of view, it refers to Japan as an "archipelago", considered the presence of groups of islands that make up it.
Taiwan was born in the 15th century, when European sailors who were passing through there soon registered the name of the island with the name of Ilha Formosa, or Wonderful Island.
The Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwestern part of Taiwan in 1624, beginning a transformation involving Aboriginal grain production systems and hiring Chinese miners to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan ended up under the control of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912); in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895 thus ceding Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan; the island remained under Japanese rule until 1945.
Machu Picchu comprises three primary structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the peripheral buildings have been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu's site had been recovered, but restoration work is still underway.
The most common format in the world for still photography, for example, is 35 mm, the same as the most used film at the end of the analog photography era.
It is still produced today and, more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Strangely, the height of the 35 mm format is 24 mm and its width is 36 mm.
The proportions of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of integers) are therefore considered 3:2.
The proportions of many common formats (for example, the APS family of formats) are equal to or very close to this value.
The so exploited and often derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism, while maintaining a measure of order within an image.
According to this rule, the most effective point where to position the main subject corresponds to the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds, both vertically and horizontally (as in the example).
At this stage in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, found itself under scrutiny.
The Christian religion had acted as a glue between European states for over a thousand years, despite linguistic and customary differences.
Its omnipresent power has influenced everyone, from the king to ordinary citizens.
One of the foundations of Christianity is that wealth must serve to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church’s monetary reserves exist precisely for this reason.
The central authority of the church has remained in Rome for over a thousand years and this convergence of power and money has prompted many to wonder whether this principle has been respected.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain decided to implement a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective: it provided for the interruption of any essential military and civilian supplies, despite this blockade violating international law usually accepted and codified by multiple international treaties of the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any vessel's access to entire sections of the ocean, also putting neutral ships at risk.
Since this tactic had elicited a limited response, Germany expected a reaction similar to its indiscriminate submarine warfare campaign.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and horrors of the First World War, nations wished to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla accepted a job offer at the Edison Company in New York City and this led him to move to the United States of America.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation written by Charles Batchelor (his manager in his previous work) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China the different periods of time were indicated in a very singular way: each period of China or each family that was in power constituted a specific dynasty.
The intervals between the individual dynasties were also characterized by periods of instability and division between the provinces. The best known was the so-called Three Kingdoms period, between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty, which lasted for 60 years.
During these periods, fierce wars broke out among many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the most violent periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting to gain a place of honor in the imposing Xi'an Palace.
The social and political effects are numerous, including the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republic, nationalism, and the belief that the nation belongs to the people and is not owned by a single sovereign.
In addition, after the Revolution the professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and fortunate to succeed.
The same goes for the military, since the army rankings, instead of being class-based, are now caliber-based.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other oppressed workers from various countries to begin their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters that go beyond earthly life. He used to go to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of the "noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave, which has survived the passage of time, offers itself a very clear picture of the spirituality of Muhammad.
The cave rests on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, completely detached from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not at all easy to find, even if it was known to exist. Once inside the cave, the isolation is total.
You can see nothing but a wonderful clear sky and a lot of mountains around. From the inside of the cave you can see or hear very little of the surrounding world.
Among the seven wonders of the world, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one not in ruins.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the great pyramidal structures built in honor of the dead pharaoh.
The plain of Giza, or "Necropolis of Giza", in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, houses numerous pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheops), several smaller tombs, various temples and the great Sphinx.
The important pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Cheops, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Pharaoh's wives and relatives.
The indication "arched up" resembles a V and the indication "arched down" resembles a staple or a square without the bottom side.
Upwards means that you should start from the tip and push the bow, and downwards means that you should start from the hammer (which is where the hand holds the bow) and pull the bow towards itself.
An ascending arc usually produces a softer sound, while a descending arc produces a stronger and more determined sound.
You may decide to add your own custom directions to the pencil, but keep in mind that the signs of the archipelago you find printed have a musical value, so in general they should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of market women forced King Louis XVI, in the grip of terror, to leave Versailles to return to Paris, along with Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Maria Teresa of 11 years and Louis Charles of 4 years) and to Elizabeth, the king's sister.
With a carriage they returned to Paris, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and shouting threats against the rulers.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their chariot open.
At one point someone in the crowd showed the terrified queen the head of a royal guard who had been killed in Versailles.
The war expenses of U.S. imperialism incurred to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover much of the expenses and interest on bonds fluctuated on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Clearly, the enormous gains derived from protracted exploitation in the time of the Filipino people constituted the profits at the basis of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must know the context that led to the creation of this order.
The time when the events took place is commonly called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history covering the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (from the year 1000 to 1300 AD).
The Full Middle Ages were preceded by the Upper Middle Ages and followed by the Lower Middle Ages, which concluded by convention in about 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that includes in practice a wide range of ideas, from technological innovation or technological imperative to the narrow sense according to which the fate of man is moved by an underlying logic, associated with scientific laws and their realization in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas in common: one is that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond political and cultural influence, and the other is that technology itself has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that the car necessarily involves the development of the road network.
However, a national road network for only a few cars is not economically sustainable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs of owning a car.
Mass possession of cars also leads to a higher percentage of accidents on the roads, and consequently the invention of new rescue techniques for the care of injured people.
Romanticism was characterized by a consistent component of cultural determinism, written by authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography has conditioned individuals, and over time there have arisen customs, customs and culture related to this geography that, being in harmony with the context of society, have proved more effective than the laws imposed in an arbitrary way.
Similarly to Paris, known today as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its notoriety as a centre of luxury began around 400 A.D. and continued until around 1100 A.D.
During the twelfth century its prestige diminished, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned bringing gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The highest point of the Gothic style was touched in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
But the slowness of the communication routes means that the spread of styles in the West can be delayed by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of the time, the result of the crusades, was the introduction of buttons to tie clothes.
Agriculture is defined as subsistence when it is practiced for the sole purpose of producing enough to meet the food needs of the farmer and his or her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, usually of organic type, that uses preserved seeds originating from the ecological region in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques aimed at getting the most out of crops.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and in many developing countries it is still so.
Subcultures unite individuals with the same opinions, who do not feel representative of society’s standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are distinguished by the age, ethnicity, social class, position and/or sex of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinctive may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a set of factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership through a peculiar and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, manners, and slang.
One of the most commonly used methods to explain the importance of socialization is to analyze some unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, have grown up without proper socialization with adults.
These children are called "feral" or savages. Some of them have been segregated by people (often their own parents): in some cases the abandonment is motivated by the refusal of a serious intellectual or physical impairment by the parents.
Working children may have suffered severe violence or trauma before abandonment or escape.
Other children may have been raised by animals; others still seem to have lived alone in the wild.
When the feral child is totally reared by non-human animals, he shows behaviors (within physical limits) almost completely analogous to those of the particular animal that took care of him, such as fear or indifference to man.
Project-based learning should make learning itself easier and more interesting, while scaffolding goes a bit further.
Scaffolding is not a learning mode, let alone a help for those who undertake a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is an example of "scaffolding", but so is the little staple-shaped assistant of Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to interrogate, prompt and explain procedures that the student may have had difficulty managing on their own.
Children are given into custody for a variety of reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse, if not even extortion.
A child should never grow up in an environment that does not provide him with nutrition, care and training, but it happens to them.
We believe that the trust represents a safe zone for these children.
Our trust system should provide safe homes, loving foster parents, stable education and reliable health care.
The trust is supposed to meet all unmet needs in the house from which they were taken.
The Internet brings together elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The characteristic elements of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage theory and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
The study by Eighmey and McCord (1998) on public reactions to websites identified two new aspects of motivation, namely "personal involvement" and "continuous relationships".
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that it is possible to find out if a person is lying by interpreting microexpressions correctly.
In his essay "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks illustrated how people unable to understand spoken language due to brain damage are however able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even argues that such skills in interpreting human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century, research has shown the existence of two pools of genetic variability, i.e. hidden variability and expressed variability.
With the mutation a new genetic variability is added, with the selection it is eliminated from the expressed variability pool.
Generation after generation, segregation and recombination redistribute the variability back and forth between the two pools.
For a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans, it is difficult to meet its own need for amino acids with the plant resources available in the savannah.
In addition, the failure to carry out such activities has serious consequences: slowing growth, malnutrition and, in the end, even death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us they are difficult to digest, unless they are cooked.
Animal foods, on the other hand (such as ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but provide a high amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
In light of all this, it should come as no surprise that our own ancestors have solved their “protein problem” in a certain sense as savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentional awakening that occurs during the normal sleep period, followed by a resumption of sleep (10–60 minutes later).
This process can be easily put into practice using a relatively silent awakening to bring you to a state of consciousness, without fully waking you up.
If you decide to reset the watch in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you will be forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-focused options include consuming many fluids before bed (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties), which force you to get up from bed to urinate.
A person enjoys an inner peace proportionally opposite to the tension existing in his body and in his spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the existing life force. Each of us has the potential capacity to find absolute peace and fulfillment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. This goal is only hindered by our tension and our negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been enriched by the love path of the Mahayana rite and various techniques of Indian yoga.
In general, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It has foundation in Kundalini Yoga, in meditation and in an all-encompassing path of love.
Kundalini Yoga activates the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) through the use of yoga positions, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Deity Yoga is the focus of Tibetan meditation. Through the depiction of various deities the energy channels are cleaned, the chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is developed.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, systemic, procedural and cultural conflicts caused a break between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies had become enemies; thus the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would have been fought for real, by mercenary armies, in the battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other countries.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken; the only option was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans proved to be outdated, however, at a time when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army advanced and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
Harnessing ships for the transport of goods is certainly the most efficient way to move large volumes of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of the navies has always been to guarantee the country the safeguard of its ability to move people and goods, while countering the same ability of enemies to move their people and their goods.
One of the recent examples in support of this theory and most noteworthy is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. During the battle, the Americans tried to move men and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to support Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany would probably have had the chance to conquer Britain, as it had done in the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
They began to be bred by the cultures and tribes of antiquity to have readily available milk, fleece, meat and skin.
Domestic goats were usually bred in herds left free to move on the hills or other pasture areas, often cared for by goats (similar to shepherds) who were often children or adolescents. These methods of pastoralism are still used today.
Already in the 16th century, wagonways were built in England.
Although they were simply made up of parallel wooden axes, the wagonways, when compared to the slightly rougher roads of the period, allowed the horses that rode them to reach higher speeds and move heavier loads.
The crossbars were introduced relatively early to keep the rails in place. Gradually, however, it was understood that the rails would be more efficient if they had an iron bar on top.
It became a common practice, although iron caused greater wear on the wooden wheels of wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels gave way to the iron ones. In 1767 the first completely iron wheels appeared.
The first means of transport that man has known were the legs. Humans began to walk in an erect position two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning "erect man").
His predecessor, the Australopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
Signs of specialization for bipedal walking are present in Australopithecus fossils dating back to 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs already seven million years ago.
To try to mitigate to some extent future suffering we can start adopting more environmentally friendly lifestyles, we can adhere to the environmental movement and also activism.
In many cases this only works as a symptomatic treatment. If instead we do not want only a temporary solution, we should find the ultimate cause of the problems and disable it.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological advances of humanity, while the problems have increased because of the overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humans.
After Congress adopted it on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
In the night they were produced between 150 and 200 copies, today known as "The Dunlap Posters".
The document was first read publicly on July 8 in the courtyard of the Independence Hall and the assignment was entrusted to John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9, while a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 edgings of Dunlap still known are the oldest existing copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
According to many paleontologists today, a category of dinosaurs has survived and is still alive. They are what we call birds.
Many tend not to consider them dinosaurs because of feathers and their ability to fly.
Yet birds have many characteristics that join them to dinosaurs.
Like the T-Rex, they have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on two hind legs.
Ultimately, the manipulation of encoded information in the form of binary numbers is the basis of all computers currently in use.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and in computer technical language these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Its symptoms, including vomiting, are very generic, so much so that an immediate diagnosis is impossible.
The main indication of internal poisoning could be the presence in the home of an open container of drugs or harmful chemicals.
Check if there are first aid instructions on the label for that specific poison.
The term mite is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from familiarity in ancient times with bed bugs, insects that have adapted strongly to become human parasites.
Both killer bed bugs and bed bugs are nesting, that is, adapted to live in the nest or in the home of their host.
In the United States of America, multiple sclerosis (MS) records about 400,000 known cases, ranking first among neurological diseases that affect young people and middle-aged adults.
MS is a condition that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that the chances of developing MS among females are double that of males.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their own interest, or that of their child.
These couples have the opportunity to choose an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, natural parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most of the scientific investigation.
But it’s not just about experimentation, since an experiment is a test that is used to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses; even asking questions and making observations can guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on various subjects of knowledge, including psychology, were accepted.
With the progressive decline of the Greek language, the West has been isolated from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many have observed that physiological rhythms and behavior depend decisively on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just reactions to external periodic signals, have been documented in relation to most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators, whose free cycle continues for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the first experiments to suggest that DNA was genetic material was the one conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, i.e. viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments highlighting the DNA of the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the bacteriophage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a number of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the relevance of the piece of genetic material involved, and whether the affected cells belong to the germline.
The mutations that can be transmitted to children are only those at the germ cell level; mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including flora and fauna.
Examples of activities to do on site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
For example, visiting, photographing and getting to know the Borneo orangutans.
Every morning, people leave small country villages to drive to work, crossing other people whose place of work is the place from which they have just left.
In this dynamic come, everyone is somehow connected to a transportation system based on private cars, which at the same time support.
Today, science reveals that this massive carbon-based economy has forced the biosphere out of one of its conditions of stability that has allowed human evolution for the past two million years.
Every person participates in social life and uses transport systems, which almost everyone complains about.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges falling into ruin.
Why do transport systems attract so many complaints, why are they rejected every day? Are the engineers who design them incompetent, or are there deeper motivations?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one point to another and the interactions they generate with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is complex because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, the behavior of drivers tends to fall within a reasonably constant range, so, in turn, traffic flows tend to show reasonable consistency and can be represented generically mathematically.
To obtain a more accurate representation of the traffic flow, the three main variables were correlated: (1) flow rate, (2) density and (3) speed.
These reports are useful for planning, designing and managing road structures.
Insects were the first animals to fly. The ability to fly allowed them to escape more easily from enemies and to find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects benefit from the ability to fold their wings along the body.
This allows them to take advantage of a greater variety of small ambushes to hide from predators.
Among all the insects that exist today, the only ones that are not able to fold their wings are dragonflies and ephemerals.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
For some he was right, but many others believed the opposite, namely that the solar system, including the Sun itself (and also the other stars), was moving around the Earth.
Which makes sense, because we don't feel like the Earth is moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the largest and second longest river on Earth. It carries an amount of water equal to 8 times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with a width that in some places reaches six miles.
20% of the total water that flows from the planet’s rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and flows into the waters of thousands of smaller tributaries.
Stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, but despite this the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in terms of size and technical excellence of their realization.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom remained enchanted by admiring the monuments of their ancestors, who at that time were much more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the one with the smallest population.
The language of the Vatican City for official legislation and communications is Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language spoken by most people working within the state, while Latin is often used in religious functions.
In the Vatican City, all citizens are Roman Catholics.
Man began to know basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper already in antiquity: these elements can be discovered in nature in native form and can be extracted quite simply with the help of primitive tools.
According to the philosopher Aristotle, everything is composed of a combination of one or more of the following four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
These are in fact more like the four states of matter, i.e. (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma. However, he also theorized that they would transform into new substances, forming what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains numerous elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There may also be alloys composed of minimal amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
In the universe, everything is made of matter and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly tiny, so many trillions of them could enter the point at the end of this sentence.
After its invention, the pencil then turned out to be a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and less and less widespread use.
Today, everyone writes messages on computer screens and never has the need to approach a temperament.
We can only ask ourselves what fate the keyboard will have when something new arrives.
The principle that it takes energy to put together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons is the basis of the operation of the fission bomb.
In practice, it's like rolling a heavy cart on a hill, so by further dividing the core, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to break down in the presence of little or no thrust.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the nearest side and 100 km on the farthest side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountainous areas.
The maria may be more numerous on the nearby side because the crust is thinner. This has facilitated the ascent of the lava to the surface.
Content theories are focused on the search for what satisfies or attracts individuals.
According to these theories, people present certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they become adults.
These theories analyze what unites some people and drives them to want to do what they do, and what are the factors of the context in which they live that drive them to do or not do certain things.
Among the most popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, when managers start directing their former colleagues, two behaviors can emerge. On the one hand, there are those who try to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
The manager of this type finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, implement disciplinary actions, evaluate performance, define and assign responsibilities.
On the opposite side, the manager turns into a completely different person, who feels he has to change the entire operation of the team and do it himself.
In the end, the leader is the person who is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This attitude often generates disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The standard of excellence of virtual teams is similar to that of conventional teams, but with a few small differences.
Virtual team members often have the point of contact function for their next physical group.
They often have greater autonomy than members of conventional teams, as meetings can take place depending on the different time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a fundamental element of a virtual team.
The “invisible team” is the management team to which each member refers and is the one that sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organization have the will to face the long process that leads to the construction of a learning organization? A good reason to implement organizational learning concepts can be innovation.
When you are able to use all the resources available effectively in all the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Consequently, the path of collaboration within an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
In order for an organization to define itself as innovative, leaders need to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) illustrates continuum theory as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological results have demonstrated the physical existence of a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. The research area becomes narrower and therefore much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is at the heart of scientists’ research.
It has long been known that certain types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and cancer can affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never before observed.
This provides us with a large amount of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our mental processes.
Although it has a strong sci-fi connotation, AI is a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
AI research includes the creation of machines to automate operations that require intelligent behavior.
Some examples of application are control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as writing, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become distinct disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real problems.
The AI system is now widely used in the economic, medical, engineering and military fields, as well as being integrated into various software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are a fundamental part of teaching. Often teachers would like to take their students to places that can not be reached by bus.
The solution is offered by technology with virtual tours. Students can see the artifacts of the museums, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing a virtual school trip is also a great pretext for sharing travel experiences and reflections with future classes.
For example, every year students at Bennet School, North Carolina, design a website on their trip to the capital; the website is redesigned every year, but previous versions are kept online and become an album.
Blogs can also help to improve students’ writing. Often, in fact, their first experiences with blogs are characterized by a poor grammar and spelling, but usually the presence of an audience changes things.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, to avoid negative reviews the blog author is committed to improving writing.
Blogs also "constrain students to become more aware of the moment around them". The need to fuel the public interest motivates students to be ingenious and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that aims to encourage collaboration and develop the learning of students well beyond the normal school day.
The correct use of blogs "can help students become more critical and analytical. By actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their own position within the writings of others, as well as outline their own perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada’s evocative and bilingual capital, full of art galleries and museums that tell the country’s past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls and to the north you can admire the natural and pristine beauty of the Muskoka region and much more.
All this and more makes Ontario typically Canadian in the opinion of foreigners.
The larger northern areas are sparsely populated, some of which are almost uninhabited wild lands.
If you compare the population, the result can be surprising for many: in the United States, the number of African-American citizens is higher than that of Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and its natural heritage makes it a continent in its own right.
Almost all of the smaller islands, known as luxury beach resorts, are mostly independent nations or associated with France.
In the lands the Arabs also brought Islam, which undertook a long journey to the Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, the discovery of the Cape route, which runs from Europe to India, by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama paved the way for European influence and colonialism.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, while to the south and west it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
For travelers: it is recommended that everyone declare that they are married, regardless of the actual marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
It is appropriate for women to realize that cultural differences can give rise to what they consider to be a nuisance, and that it is not unusual for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and do not be afraid to oppose them (cultural differences or not, there is no justification!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC; with the name of Anfa, it was a port of strategic importance used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed it to rebuild it under the name of the White House, which they abandoned in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city called Daru l-Badya, then called Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who chose these places for their trading bases.
Throughout Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities for shopping.
In the vicinity of the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tajin, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs and a lot of chincagliero, but all this is reserved only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, Nyiragongo volcano lava destroyed Goma, burying much of the city’s streets, especially those in the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, it is advisable to document yourself well before making any visits outside of Goma, in order to assess well the state of the clashes that still persist in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as being one of the least expensive opportunities to see Africa’s mountain gorillas.
You can use a boda-boda (taxi-motorcycle) to get around Goma. The normal price (in local currency) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Even as a result of its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuct<0xC3><0xB9>" ended up becoming an exotic and distant land metaphor.
Today Timbuktu is a fallen city, but for its reputation it remains a tourist attraction, also equipped with an airport.
In 1990, it was included in the UNESCO list of heritage sites that are in danger, due to the threat posed by the desert sands.
In the Henry Louis Gates special of PBS "Wonders of the African World" was one of the main stages.
With its more Arabic than African touch, the city stands out from the rest of the country.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and winds east along the border with Mozambique, to the north border with Zimbabwe, and its southern border is represented by the Crocodile River.
With an area of 19,500 km2, the park comprises 14 different ecozones, each of which provides support for a different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the most important of the South African national parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there are daily contributions for conservation and entry to the park.
The purchase of a Wild Card could also be useful, as it allows access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong, which gives its name to the entire territory, is the main destination for many tourists.
The series of buildings forming the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a glittering bar chart, even more evident because framed by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and visit the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
Most of the urban development of the island of Hong Kong has focused on the densely populated, reclaimed land on the northern coast.
This is the place that the English colonizers chose for themselves, so if you are looking for testimonies of the colonial past of this land, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal range of mangroves in the world. It extends for 80 km (50 mi) from the coast inland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of the forest included in the Indian territory takes the name of Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only made up of mangrove swamps: there is also what remains of the imposing jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third consists of swampy areas.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have become a sanctuary for wildlife; the area is estimated to have 400 Bengal royal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although many (especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang) depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since service buses between different districts are often full, it will be good to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the neighborhoods are reached by comfortable and sturdy small Japanese buses.
Shared taxis are a convenient and fast way to reach nearby resorts, including Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a sloping bridge that connects the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
Its two lanes have a height of 83 meters, is 378 meters long and has two lanes 3,50 meters wide.
Under the bridge the free vertical space is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but the opening to traffic took place only in March 2017.
In September 2017, when probably the Brazilian customs checkpoints will be completed, the bridge should be fully functional.
The Guaran<0xC3><0xAD> were the most important indigenous group living in present-day eastern Paraguay. They were seminomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and Payagu<0xC3><0xA1>, who lived on hunting, harvesting and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "The Great Province of the Indies", was born in the 16th century from the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period that lasted three centuries, the period of colonization.
Since the founding of Asunci<0xC3><0xB3>n in 1537, Paraguay has been able to retain much of its identity and native peculiarities.
Everyone knows that Argentina boasts one of the best teams and the best polo players in the world.
In December, the most important tournament of the year takes place in the Las Ca<0xC3><0xB1>itas polo fields.
Here you can watch minor tournaments and matches also at other times of the year.
To receive information about tournaments and the purchase of tickets for polo matches please contact the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The Falkland Islands have their official currency, the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is equivalent to that of the British Pound (GBP).
The only bank in the islands, located in Stanley in front of the FIC West store, offers currency exchange service.
British Pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands. At Stanley you can often also pay with credit cards and U.S. dollars.
Credit cards are likely not accepted on the peripheral islands, although UK and US currencies may be accepted. Check with the owners in advance to decide on an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falkland Islands outside the islands, so you change the money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; during the summer months temperatures above 30°C are quite normal.
Winter can be deceptively cold: rarely temperatures reach below zero, but the combination of wind and humidity gives the sensation of a temperature lower than that marked by the thermometer.
There are no definite "dry" and "rainy" seasons: the amount of rain remains almost constant throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are accustomed to human sight, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
The park authorities recommend maintaining a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves and a distance of 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals.
No matter how docile they may seem: bison, elk, deer, bears, virtually all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors suffer injuries for not maintaining an adequate distance. It is necessary to leave these animals adequate space because they are large, wild and potentially dangerous animals.
Also keep in mind that odors can attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing food with you or cooking with very strong odors, and try to keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of the Samoan islands. It is located on the island of Upolu and its population is just under 40,000.
Apia was founded between 1850 and 1860 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In this port occurred the notorious naval stalemate of 1889, in which seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, with the exception of a British cruiser, and nearly 200 U.S. and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the killing of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the supreme leader.
There are many beaches, since Auckland is located between two ports. The most popular are divided into three areas.
The beaches overlooking the Pacific Ocean of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are mainly sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and most of them enjoy the shade of pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive in Auckland Central, in the elegant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, overlook Waitemata Harbour.
These are family-friendly beaches sometimes a bit crowded, surrounded by a wide choice of shops. You can bathe safely.
The best known local beer is a non-complex, pleasant and refreshing beer called "Number One". The other local beer is called "Manta".
You can have a lot of French wines, but Australian and New Zealanders could cope better with the trip.
The tap water of the place is totally safe to drink, but if you are afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
According to Australians, 'flat white' coffee originates from a foreign idea. The 'espresso' is black short coffee, the cappuccino is covered with cream (not foam) and the tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is at the same level as the Belgian one. Fruit juices are expensive, but very good.
Throughout the year there are many excursions on the coral reef and injuries for one of these causes on the coral reef are rare.
Always ask the authorities for advice, follow the instructions and pay special attention to safety warnings.
The cubomeduses appear from October to April near the beaches and estuaries of the rivers north of Seventeen Seventy. Outside this period they can only be found occasionally.
Sharks are present, but rarely attack the man. Most sharks fear him and tend to stay away.
The habitat of saltwater crocodiles consists mainly of estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton, not actively living them in the ocean.
By booking in advance, the traveler has the serenity of finding a place to sleep once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often make agreements with certain hotels, but it is still possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through the same agencies.
Travel agencies generally offer packages including breakfast, transfers to/from the airport or even combined flight+hotel packages.
They can also keep the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to get you additional documents needed for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests must be submitted first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, most participants decide to camp on site, considering this aspect a crucial element of the experience.
To be close to the center of the action it is necessary to arrive early and acquire a space close to the music.
Remember that once the music is finished on the main stages, there may be sections of the festival where the music lasts until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the North Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, since crossing the ice causes rather annoying noises for those who are most exposed to it.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include time spent exploring the city. Cruise passengers are granted a visa waiver (check the conditions).
Generally, casinos do their best to increase the time and money spent by their guests as much as possible. Generally, there are no windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer exclusive food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in a high mood making sure they stay.
Alcoholic beverages are offered in some rooms from the house. However, the state of drunkenness alters the ability to judge and every good gambler knows how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who decides to drive at high altitudes or on mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or temperatures close to zero.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is reduced and it is not possible to drive like when you are on clean asphalt.
During a snow storm, in a very short time so much snow can fall that you stay stuck.
Precipitation and snowstorms, or the formation of ice or condensation on the vehicle windows, can also reduce visibility.
However, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic continues to flow almost continuously throughout the year.
Safaris are probably Africa’s biggest tourist attraction and the focus of many visitors’ vacations.
In popular use, the term safari refers to trips by land, particularly in the savannah, to see the beautiful African wildlife.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to cars, so normal equipment is enough to get a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes fearful and therefore can be best observed with the binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "bush walk", "hiking safari", or "walking safari") is an excursion that can last a few hours or more days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2012, and some of the events will take place in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, the first of which was held in 1964.
If your booking for flights and accommodation for 2020 was made before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but most coronavirus-related cancellation policies, at the end of March 2020, do not arrive until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
The cost of most event tickets is expected to be between <0xC2><0xA5>2,500 and <0xC2><0xA5>130,000, while normal tickets will cost around <0xC2><0xA5>7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can make it easier to dry. Many hotels offer the use of iron and ironing board, even if they are not present in the room.
If you do not have an iron, or if you do not like to wear stretched socks, you can try a hairdryer, if you have one available.
Be careful not to expose the fabrics to too high temperatures, to avoid shrinkage or, in the worst case, burns.
There are several ways to sanitize water and some of these prove to be more effective against specific risks.
In some areas it is enough to boil the water for a minute, in others it takes many minutes.
The effectiveness of the filters is variable, so in case of doubt it is advisable to evaluate the purchase of packaged water inside sealed bottles from a reliable company.
Travellers may come into contact with animal pests that are not widespread in their regions of origin.
Parasites can spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst case scenario, cause allergic reactions, as well as transmit poison or infections.
The same infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can hurt or kill people by force are not usually qualified as harmful animals.
Duty-free purchases are an opportunity to purchase duty-free and excise-free products in certain locations.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save a lot, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
The section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway between Point Marion and Fairmont is the one that presents the most difficult driving conditions, as it often crosses isolated areas among the vegetation.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, it is advisable to keep your eyes open, as steep slopes, narrow streets and narrow bends predominate.
The speed limits exposed are significantly lower than those applied in the previous and subsequent sections (normally 35-40 mph / 56-64 km/h). Their strict observance is extremely important.
Strangely, however, in this area the level of coverage of the mobile phone service is much higher than that of other sections of the route, for example in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
The German desserts are quite good and in Bavaria they are quite tasty and varied, similar to those of neighboring Austria to the south.
Fruit cakes are a timeless classic, from those with apples available all year round to those with cherries and plums, which make their appearance during the summer.
Several German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. The most popular cakes are often very well accompanied by a strong cup of coffee.
If you want to taste small but rich in flavored desserts, you can focus on those that, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish prepared with herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be both "dry" and "wet", depending on the amount of liquid contained.
In northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is normally used for curry in inland regions; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is more commonly used.
Given the presence of 17,000 islands to choose from, the term Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found in the country.
However, when used without further specification, the term generally refers to foods originating from the central and eastern area of the main island, Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widespread throughout the archipelago, offers a range of dishes of simple preparation; its predominant flavors are given by the use of peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The brackets are supports for the rider's feet and are hung on both sides of the saddle.
They guarantee greater stability to the rider but may present safety problems due to the possibility that the rider's feet will remain stuck.
If a pup is bumped by a horse but has a foot stuck in his brace, he could be dragged by the running horse. To minimize this risk, there are some safety measures that can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots equipped with a heel and a smooth and rather thin sole.
Subsequently, some saddles, especially the English ones, inserted safety bars, which cause a leather bracket to stand out from the saddle when, in the event of a fall, the rider pulls it back.
Cocham<0xC3><0xB3> Valley: Chile’s most important climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, where a large number of huge walls and granite cliffs are slashed.
The peaks of the peaks include breathtaking views. Climbers from all parts of the world continuously trace new paths on its walls, potentially endless.
Free-riding snow sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very widespread and provide snow slide thanks to the use of skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities and boasts multiple enthusiasts, sometimes also called "ski bums" (ski skiers), who dedicate entire periods of vacation to the skiing activity in a particular area.
The principle behind skiing is very ancient: the first rock paintings depicting humans skiing date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport has its origins at least in the 17th century; in 1861 the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by the Norwegians.
Hiking on skis: the activity is also called off-piste, ski mountaineering or trekking on skis.
It is connected, although usually does not understand them, to ski touring or skiing, which are practiced on steep terrain and require much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski slope as a trail similar to the hiking trail.
If the conditions are good, you can cover distances somewhat larger than those traveled on foot, but only very rarely will you reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on cross-country skiing.
Europe is a relatively small continent but consists of many independent countries. Normally, to travel through multiple countries you would need to apply for a visa and pass through passport control several times.
However, in this respect, the Schengen area works rather like a single country.
If you stay within this area, you can normally go from one border to the other without having to pass passport checks again.
Similarly, if you are in possession of a Schengen visa, it is not necessary to apply for visas for individual member countries, thus saving time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition of what makes an article a piece of antiques. Some tax agencies consider such an object to be at least 100 years old.
The definition differs geographically from the age limit which may be lower, as in the case of North America compared to Europe.
Craft items could be defined as antique pieces, although more recent than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer farming is an important source of livelihood for the S<0xC3><0xA1>mi and the culture on which this trade is based is also the basis of many other professions.
Even over time, not all S<0xC3><0xA1>mi were involved in large-scale reindeer farming; some lived by fishing, hunting, and similar activities, using reindeer primarily as working animals.
Tourism is an important source of income in S<0xC3><0xA1>pmi, the territory of the S<0xC3><0xA1>mi.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma people, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and a misperception of Roma people.
If a travel warning is issued for the destination you will be visiting, there may be consequences on your travel health insurance or your insurance in the event of a trip cancellation.
You may also be interested in the opinions of governments other than your own, but keep in mind that such opinions are aimed at citizens of those governments.
For example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East might encounter different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The warnings are simply a brief summary of a country’s political situation.
The opinions reported are often superficial, generic and simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
"Adverse weather conditions" is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that may cause damage, serious social distress or loss of life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur in any part of the world, and there are different types, depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong gusts of wind, hail, above-normal rainfall and uncontrolled fires are manifestations and consequences of adverse weather conditions, similar to thunderstorms, tornadoes, sea trumpets and cyclones.
Among the weather phenomena of strong regional and seasonal intensity are storms, snowstorms, ice storms and sand storms.
Travellers are advised to inquire about adverse weather conditions that affect their area, as they could affect travel planning.
Anyone planning to visit a country potentially considerable as a war zone, must support professional training.
By searching the Internet for 'Course on hostile environments' you are likely to find the address of a local company.
A course will normally deal with all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually using hands-on experience.
A course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing games, as well as many first aid and sometimes weapons training activities.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in nature are widespread, while few publications deal with war zones.
Travelers who are planning a surgery to change sex abroad must make sure they have valid documents with them for the return trip.
The intention of governments to issue passports without gender (X) or updated documents to match a desired name and gender is variable.
Equally variable is the willingness of foreign governments to accept such documents.
Security inspections also became much more scrupulous in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Transgender people in the pre-operative phase should not expect to pass checks without their privacy and dignity being compromised.
The ripple currents are the return flow of the waves that break on the beach, often near a coral reef or similar formations.
Given the underwater topology, the return flow concentrates in some deeper sections where a strong current can form towards the open sea.
Most deaths survive due to fatigue in the attempt to swim countercurrently, which may prove impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, going back to swimming will not be more difficult than normal.
Try to identify an area where you are not at risk of being trapped again, or evaluate whether to wait for rescues, based on your skills and whether you have been spotted.
The return shock manifests itself in a shorter time than the cultural shock (being a smaller "honeymoon" phase), lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travellers who have found it easy to adapt to the new culture, sometimes have difficulty adapting to the culture of their home country.
Upon returning home after living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the uses of your home culture.
In the first experience abroad, you are likely to have met patient and understanding people, aware that travelers to a new country need to adapt.
Many people did not imagine patience and awareness were necessary even for those who return home.
The show of sounds and lights of the pyramid is the most interesting thing there is in the area for children.
Before the start of the show, it will be possible to admire the pyramids immersed in darkness and silence.
Normally you always hear the noise caused by tourists and sellers. The spectacle of sounds and lights is just like a book of tales.
The Sphinx becomes the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and each pyramid is illuminated.
Claimed by various countries, the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have the largest number of bases, of which sixteen are active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island is the largest and is home to the small town of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among the other islands are Livingston Island and Deception; on the latter, the caldera of a still active volcano filled with water from its source to a magnificent natural harbor.
The land of Ellsworth is the region that lies south of the peninsula and overlooks the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, then re-emerge and form the Ellsworth Mountains, a 360-kilometer chain cut in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, known as the Sentinel Chain, boasts the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches 4892 m with Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, without mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only possible alternative.
A satellite phone is not usually a replacement for a mobile phone, because to call you have to be outdoors with the visual clearing up to the satellite.
The service is often used by pleasure craft, including pleasure craft, as well as by missions that require remote data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
One of the increasingly popular options among those planning to take a sabbatical year is to travel and learn.
It is particularly prevalent among neo-diplomats, since they can take a year before starting university without compromising their education.
In many cases enrolling in a course abroad in the sabbatical year can actually increase the chances of resuming higher education upon returning to your home country.
Usually enrolling in these educational programs requires payment of a fee.
Finland is the ideal destination for those who love to sail. In the "Land of a Thousand Lakes" there are also thousands of islands, inside the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
There is no need for a yacht for the archipelagos and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are certainly large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Sailing is the national pastime of Finland, where one boat counts every seven or eight people.
This also happens in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in general it is a rather singular fact (e.g. in the Netherlands the ratio is one to forty).
Most of the different Baltic cruises include a multi-day stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic town for two full days, returning to the ship in the evening to sleep.
A separate visa (starting from 2009) will not be required for the descent to land using the on-board excursions.
Some brochures also offer cruises in Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, also the visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can scare people of all ages and conditions, especially if they have never flown before or had some traumatic experience.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is not dissimilar to the fears and personal aversions that many people manifest towards other things.
For some people, understanding a little bit about how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can be helpful in overcoming a fear based on what’s unknown, or not being in control.
Couriers are well paid to deliver products quickly. Often the timing is very important in the case of business documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
For some routes, larger companies use their own aircraft, but for other routes and in the case of smaller companies, problems emerged.
On some routes, air shipments would take days for unloading and customs.
The only way to make it arrive faster would be to ship it as hold baggage. And this is where you come into play, since airline regulations do not allow you to ship luggage without a passenger.
To fly in first class or in business class the most obvious way is to pay a nice amount for the privilege (or, even better, convince your company to do so).
However, the price to pay is high: indicatively, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economic rate for business trips and up to eleven times the rate for those in first class!
In general, on direct flights from A to B it is not even worth looking for discounts on first class or business class seats.
Airlines know well that there is a category of travelers willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting to their destination quickly and comfortably, and consequently apply certain fares.
The capital of Moldova is Chi<0xC5><0x9F>in<0xC4><0x83>u and the local language is Romanian. However, Russian is also very widespread.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that in the past was the scene of an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, with its own government and currency, but not recognized by any UN member country.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations between these two areas of Moldova have been restored.
The predominant religion in Moldova is the Christian-Orthodox religion.
Smyrna is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million; it is the second largest port after Istanbul and an important crossroads for transport.
The ancient city of Smyrna spreads over a huge bay, is surrounded by mountains and currently constitutes a modern, evolved and active shopping center.
Although the atmosphere in the city is more similar to that of Mediterranean Europe than that of traditional Turkey, the wide avenues, buildings with glass facades and modern shopping malls are dotted with characteristic red tile roofs, the 18th century market and ancient mosques and churches.
In the village of Haldarsvik you can enjoy beautiful views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and you can visit a unique octagonal church.
In the shrine of the church, on some of the tombs, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
Half an hour is enough to walk around the enchanting village.
To the north is the romantic and charming city of Sintra, easily accessible. It has become famous in the eyes of foreigners thanks to the brilliant tale of its splendor written by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb 403 line bus regularly connects with Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north, visit the great shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (place of worship), a place of Marian apparitions celebrated all over the world.
Remember that the site you are visiting is basically a common pit, and has an almost incalculable meaning to a significant part of the world’s population.
There are still many men and women who have survived in these places, and many others who have seen their loved ones murdered or made to work to the death, whether Jewish or not.
Treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves. Avoid jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Avoid misrepresenting these places by embracing the structures with signs or graffiti.
In the city of Barcelona the official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority is able to understand it; Spanish is known by practically everyone.
However, most of the signals are written exclusively in Catalan, which is by law the first official language.
Spanish, however, is also widely used for public transport and other services.
In the metro, ordinary announcements are only in Catalan. Any unplanned service interruptions are communicated in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese, thanks to an automatic system.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude and presumptuous.
Although it is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to feel good in Paris is still to behave at its best, treating yourself as a "bien levé" (well-educated) person. This will definitely facilitate your travels.
The rough exterior appearance of the Parisians will fade quickly if you show some basic good manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is rich in forests, predominantly beech, peach and fir trees, and is characterized by a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to a multiplicity of microclimates, soils and different levels of altitude presents a wide variety of plant communities.
The area is also home to a huge variety of animal and bird species.
Rare species such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wild cat and the cedar rooster live in these places, alongside several other more widespread animal species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and to cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide stoles for women who arrive unprepared, but if you already have one, especially if in bright colors, you will gain a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear long pants all the way under their knees.
These can also be borrowed from the warehouse at the entrance; however, clothes are not washed after each wearer, so wearing these skirts may not make you feel comfortable. For men, one size fits all!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil everywhere.
The Pa amb Oli is a simple popular dinner, typical of the summer season: bread with olive oil, tomato and all available seasonings, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, in addition to the pronoun "You" used for the form of courtesy that stands for "You", always start with the capital, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important mechanism for distinguishing certain verbs and complements.
This aspect probably also facilitates reading, although the need to understand whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantiated form makes writing rather complex.
The Italian pronunciation is relatively simple since most words are pronounced as they are written.
The main letters to pay attention to are the c and g, since their pronunciation changes according to the following vowel.
Also, be sure to pronounce "r" and "rr" differently: dear means beloved, while carriage means carriage.
Persian has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar manual could help you a lot with Persian grammar and in understanding sentences.
It goes without saying that if you already know a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, people with minimal knowledge of the Spanish language can come to the rash conclusion that Portuguese is quite similar and therefore should not be studied separately.
These days, premodern observatories are obsolete and serve as museums or educational places.
Since light pollution in their golden age was not a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge structures in remote areas where weather conditions are favorable.
The admiration of cherry blossoming, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where plum blossoming was preferred.
In Japan, the first feasts for cherry blossoming were organized by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy close to the imperial court.
Plants give their best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even "only" one specimen.
If you visit an Italian garden, even collecting some specimens of plants will cost you the distance from this place, without discussion.
In general, Singapore is a very safe and easy-to-go city; you can buy virtually anything once you arrive.
But being in the "high tropics", just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with the heat (always) and the strong sun (rarely, when the sky is clear).
Some buses also head north to Hebron, the traditional place where the Bible patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives were buried.
Make sure that the bus you want to take reaches the interior of Hebron and does not stop at the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a great theme around which to organize a holiday.
For example, you can visit the castles in the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley, you can take a cruise to visit the interesting cities of the Danube or you can sail on the Erie Canal.
In addition, they define the routes of hiking trails and well-known cycle paths.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity and celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
One tradition is to spend Easter night staying awake in an outdoor place to admire the dawn.
There are of course Christian theological explanations behind this tradition, but it could well be a pre-Christian ritual linked to spring and fertility.
In the most traditional churches, an Easter vigil is often celebrated on Saturday night of the Easter weekend, with congregations often starting the midnight ceremony to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands arrived there by swimming, flying or floating.
Because the distance from the mainland was considerable, the mammals could not cope with the journey. This made the giant turtle the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Numerous mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, dogs and cats were introduced to the Galapagos after the arrival of man.
If you visit the territories of the Arctic or Antarctic during the winter, you will be able to experience the polar night, when the sun remains below the horizon.
This phenomenon offers the opportunity to witness the northern dawn, because the sky remains dark almost all day.
Since the territories are sparsely populated, light pollution is often not a problem and you can also enjoy the stars.
In Japan, the culture of work is more hierarchical and formal than that to which Westerners tend to be accustomed.
Office clothing usually consists of a jacket and tie or a suit and is addressed to colleagues with the surname or professional title.
The harmony of the workplace is of crucial importance, as it gives importance to the commitment of the group rather than praise individual achievements.
Workers often have to receive approval from their superiors for every decision, and they are expected to follow instructions without asking questions.
