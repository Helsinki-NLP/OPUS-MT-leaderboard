Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law on the introduction of administrative responsibility for the violation of the time and procedure of payment of goods (works, services) when making purchases for state and municipal needs.
This law is intended to address the very acute problem of non-fulfilment of their obligations by customers in the implementation of public and municipal procurement.
Two years ago, the situation where entrepreneurs could not receive payment under already executed state and municipal contracts was ubiquitous.
At the same time, the President of Russia instructed the Prosecutor General’s Office of the Russian Federation to take the problem under special control.
Because the businessmen themselves could not cope with unscrupulous customers who entered into unfunded contracts, tried to evade payment obligations and included illegal conditions in the contracts.
The problem was systemic in the country as a whole.
Since 2015, in order to protect the rights of entrepreneurs to receive payment for public orders, the Prosecutor’s Office submitted 9,7 thousand submissions, as a result of their consideration, 4,5 thousand officials were brought to disciplinary liability, to the administrative - 533, to the investigative bodies for the organization of procedural inspections.
As a result, the debt to entrepreneurs in the amount of more than 66 billion rubles was repaid.
And these huge sums were not accumulated as a result of the non-payment of multi-billion contracts.
Numerous, systematic delays in the payment of services to entrepreneurs have resulted in much more modest amounts.
Here's a typical case.
The head of a small company won the competition for the provision of social transport services for several million rubles.
The person invested all his working capital, fully fulfilled the obligations, but did not receive the money in time.
The result is a growing financial pile of debt on salaries, taxes, loans, which would lead to bankruptcy if the entrepreneur did not seek help from the prosecutor's office.
Now, in some regions, the problem has been managed to level as much as possible.
However, as of the first half of 2017, the total amount of debt under state and municipal contracts, identified by prosecutors of entities of the Russian Federation, amounted to about 27.4 billion rubles.
In regions where indebtedness rates continue to reach critical levels, the Prosecutor’s Office operates under manual crisis management.
The Prosecutor-General personally conducts exit meetings with representatives of local authorities, at which all violations discovered by prosecutors and measures for their immediate elimination are subjectively discussed.
Such operational meetings this year have already been held in Yaroslavl and Yekaterinburg.
To improve the payment discipline of public customers will be able to implement the Federal Law No. 189-FZ "On Amendments to the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offences in Part of the Establishment of Administrative Responsibility of the Customer's Officials and the Order of Purchases for the violation of the term and procedure of payment of goods (work)
The draft law was developed by the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia at the initiative of the Prosecutor General’s Office.
The new law will supplement the Code of the Russian Federation on administrative offences with an article that provides for a fine of 30 thousand to 50 thousand rubles for violation by an official of the customer of the time and procedure for payment of goods, works and services in public and municipal procurement.
And if the official has already been subjected to administrative punishment for a similar offense, he is awaiting disqualification for a period of one year to two years.
All prosecutors of the subjects of the Russian Federation have already been instructed to ensure the application of these legislative novellas in practice.
Civil Rights Protection Group Announces Warning on Movement in Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of the Colored Population issued a warning to colored people traveling to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and attacks on racist grounds.
The statement of the group reads as follows: "Warning for the National Association for the Advancement of the Colored Population, valid until August 28, 2017, calls on African-American travelers, guests and citizens of the state of Missouri to be particularly attentive and to exercise increased caution in allocating pilgrimages to the staff.
According to the National Association for Promoting the Advancement of the Colored Population, the group’s announcement of a movement warning was prompted by a recently passed law in Missouri that made it harder for people to win discrimination-related lawsuits, as well as the fact that state law enforcement agencies disproportionately often choose their targets.
“You have people who are subject to human rights violations.
They are stopped on the roads because of the color of their skin, beaten and killed," Rod Chapell, president of the National Association to Promote the Progress of the Colored Population of Missouri, told the Kansas City Star newspaper.
“We hear complaints more often than ever before.”
This is the first warning of its kind issued by the organization against the U.S. state.
The group cited incidents such as the racial humiliation of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of twenty-eight-year-old Tori Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gasoline while on a state tour, and Missouri State Police arrested him without bringing any charges of the crime.
The warning also mentions a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General’s Office that said black drivers are 75 percent more likely to be stopped on the road than white drivers.
"The goal of the warning is for people to be aware of the situation and to warn their relatives and friends and colleagues about what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
“People should be prepared one way or another, whether they take money with them for collateral or report to relatives that they are traveling through the state territory.”
According to the latest data from the FBI’s Hate Crime Reporting Program, there were 100 hate crimes in Missouri in 2015, making it the sixteenth state in the state in the number of hate crimes.
The motion warning is also a response to a new law in the state of Missouri that will make it more difficult to sue a legal person for housing or employment discrimination.
Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Protection Union (ACLU) issued warnings to travelers in Texas and Arizona after these states passed new immigration control laws, under which local law enforcement agencies were ordered to arrest people for violating immigration laws, which, according to ACLU, was due to increase the number of people arrested for violating immigration laws.
Traffic warnings are usually issued by the Department of State in relation to other countries, but recently public organizations have resorted to this measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two people killed as a result of the shooting of a police patrol in Egypt
Unidentified people fired on a police patrol in the Egyptian city of Isna, Reuters reports, citing Egypt’s Interior Ministry.
During the shooting, two people, including one policeman, were killed and three people were injured.
All the wounded were taken to the hospital.
According to the agency, police stopped the car, after which two armed men in the car opened fire on law enforcement officers.
One of the attackers was arrested, the other managed to escape.
Rosturism supports the law on the cancellation of free baggage for non-refundable air tickets
The head of Rosturism Oleg Safonov said in an interview with the RBC television channel that he is "positive" about the adoption of the law on the cancellation of free baggage transport for non-refundable tickets.
"It is necessary to create conditions in which a person who does not have luggage can buy a ticket cheaper than the one who has luggage," he stressed.
At the same time, Mr. Safonov noted that, despite the fears of citizens, it will not be necessary to pay for the carriage of upper clothing and mobile phone in the hand luggage.
“It would be right to reassure all our citizens and tourists and to say it, to say that it will not be related to the upper garment, to the umbrella, to the mobile phone, to the iPad or even to some computer,” the head of Rosturism said.
Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law that provides for the right of airlines to exclude the rule on the free carriage of luggage with a non-refundable ticket.
We are talking about the fact that airlines can determine the number of seats and the weight of luggage included in the non-refundable tariff.
Vladimir Putin ordered to eliminate the pollution of Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin at a meeting on the protection of Baikal said that in recent years, significant areas of the lake have been exposed to extreme pollution.
He commissioned to identify sources of funding, plans and executors for the eradication of pollution.
Mr. Putin also instructed to carry out a full recovery of the contaminated territories.
"It is necessary to deal with the objects that continue to work here, the purification facilities of most of them are worn out," the president's RIA Novosti quoted him as saying.
He also added that the Prosecutor General’s Office of Russia should conduct an inspection to identify environmentally harmful activities.
According to him, in the area of the lake there are problems associated with the appearance of natural landfills and a number of violations in the field of ecology by the organizers of recreation.
“I want to emphasize this: not to check everything in a row, here too, the measure needs to be known, but it is illegal and environmentally harmful activities and take appropriate measures,” he stressed.
Earlier, the Prosecutor General's Office reported on the reduction of fish stocks in Lake Baikal and proposed to increase the number of facilities that fall under environmental supervision.
Recall, on June 15, Vladimir Putin in the course of the direct line stated the need to change the legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in the natural territories of the special protection regime.
He was informed about problems with the management of economic activities by the inhabitants of the island of Olhon, which is part of the Baikal natural territory.
The head of the Ministry of Nature Sergey Donskaya immediately proposed to solve the problem by clarifying the boundaries of the Baikal water protection zone, but the government of Buryatia reminded that such a change is not enough, as the restrictions are related to a number of normative acts.
Previously, the Ministry of Economics proposed to solve the problem by amending the Land Code and the Environmental Protection Act.
There will be a new temple in the city.
In the village of Sosva, members of the community from the representatives of the indigenous few peoples of the North "Rahtynya", together with the inhabitants of the Berezovsky district take part in the construction of the Orthodox church in honor of Saint Nicholas the Wonderworker.
Its location - the river bank, the temple will be well visible from afar, so it will serve as a lighthouse for fishermen.
According to the representatives of the community, construction work will be completed already this year, domes are now installed, church bells are available.
The Igrim REB fleet provided transport support.
The temple is named after Saint Nicholas the Wonderworker, as it is revered by the Orthodox Church as the patron saint of travelers, including fishermen.
In Sosva, the fishery gives the settlers a job, feeds them.
The locals wait for the temple to open its doors, and the children even write in school writings about it as a local attraction.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why are laws enforced in Singapore?
I'm talking to a local businessman, Chang, sitting in an outdoor dining room.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, while the smoker neatly stores an iron box with him from the office.
At the end of the conversation, the businessman goes to the nearest urn - to it a hundred meters - and throws bulls there.
The fine for garbage in a public place is 500 local dollars, - reports Chang.
You know, since I was a child, I just had a reflex: you can't throw a snitch from the candy to the bridge, you'll be fined immediately.
There are video cameras everywhere now.
And indeed - the sidewalks of Singapore in the center of the city are clean, as if in a museum.
Three months ago, his neighbor’s 18-year-old son painted graffiti on the wall of an old colonial building.
The court found the man guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to torture.
What?!
Imagine that.
He received ten punches with a wooden stick on his buttocks and spent a week in prison.
Corporal punishment is not uncommon.
As in Singapore combine the highest standard of living and incredibly harsh laws, the observer "AiF" studied on the spot.
No one here thinks of abolishing the death penalty, explains lawyer Victor Lee Hong.
And the government has long not cared about the opinion of both the European Union and the United States on this matter.
If a person carries a large batch of drugs or trades in them, he is given a hangover.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian man was arrested at Changi airport, carrying 400 grams of cocaine.
In his defense, the Australian prime minister threatened sanctions, international human rights defenders and even the pope.
The boy was eventually hanged.
After that, drug couriers carefully travel around our country on the side.
The thing is, Singapore has a rule that laws must be followed by everyone in a row, not just the humble and the poor.
It does not matter who you are - a millionaire, a vice-premier, a famous artist or a resident of the European Union.
There's only one option in this case: if you get a penny of cocaine, you're going to be hanged.
When you walk around Singapore and everywhere you meet signs with a lot of warnings, you simply wonder - how many prohibitions in this city-state!
For example, chewing gum is sold only in pharmacies, and you can buy it strictly on the prescription (!) of a doctor.
The tourist on arrival will not take the chewing gum, but it is worth gluing the "rubber" in the subway, will impose a fine of 1000 local dollars.
In four days, I met two people with white plaques on their neck: “I was trashing.”
For thrown past the urn, the curfew in addition to the fine is often condemned to "link to the barracks": a week to clean up parks and beaches.
6 thousand rubles. pays a "criminal" who forgot to wash the water in a public toilet, and when trying to do a small need in the elevator of a residential house, a special detector is activated - the doors are blocked and a signal is sent to the police.
Among the very exotic laws - prohibitions on feeding pigeons on the street, public performance of songs and even excessive watering of the indoor plant (!): it is believed that the abundance of water attracts mosquitoes.
To avoid fires, smokers can not carry lighters in the subway, otherwise they will be fined 5,000 Singapore dollars.
In general, there is a thought: no matter how hard you try, you will definitely break something.
This is not the case at all, - is trying to convince me Mohammed Kabir-Kajaria, the owner of the local travel agency.
Especially fantastic laws exist only on paper, and in the last twenty years I have not seen anyone attracted for their violation.
Why are they still there?
So that the citizens do not relax.
Compliance with the basic rules is strictly monitored.
Let’s say, if a minor is sold cigarettes in the kiosk, then everyone in the chain will be punished: the store owner will pay a huge amount, the offender himself will receive blows with sticks on the “back”, and the seller will also be evicted and put in prison.
It is because of such harsh laws that crimes in Singapore are very rare.
Is that justified?
Back in the 1970s we had chaos on the roads - motorists ignored traffic lights, drove as they wanted, sat drunk behind the wheel.
After the introduction of the fines for a year, everything calmed down.
Now the driver, after drinking a portion of whisky, knows: if stopped, the police officer will not let go for a bribe, impose a fine in the amount of the cost of the apartment and for years send for the grid.
To many foreigners, the city-state in Southeast Asia seems to be a kind of concentration camp.
In 1993, the American writer William Gibson called Singapore “Disneyland with the Death Penalty” – a guest from the United States horrified the general wealth of residents, “a frighteningly clean airport” and “cultured nature”.
Descate, such things are unnatural, look artificial, and so in principle should not be.
The first days in Singapore and you are afraid to throw paper on the sidewalk, you catch up if you get on the subway with ice cream.
But then you come to the "Little India" district, and all of a sudden there's a "pattern crack": the bus stop has plastic cups.
"What's that like?" you wonder.
That's right, the Singaporeans are smiling.
It's all happening.
Not for every such "crime" will be caught on the spot, but you should know: if you are counted, you will not get rid of - because you have violated the law.
This is often enough for a person to behave normally.
Of course, the power in Singapore is quite authoritarian.
But you know what?
In Vietnamese Ho Chi Minh City, I moved very carefully - motorcyclists often take smartphones and cameras out of the hands of tourists.
In the center of Paris is full of dirty bombs and beggars.
In our streets, not everyone tries to throw garbage into the urns.
Thanks to a set of draconian fines and ruthless (up to the death penalty) laws, Singapore has become the most peaceful, clean and safe city on Earth.
You're thinking.
This is human nature: remember, and in Russia, no one got behind the wheel until they began to fine.
Although the main thing in Singapore is not fines, but voluntary compliance with the laws.
And we have to think that in Russia, people would also be happy with clean streets, the absence of garbage in the subway and would welcome the arrest of those who confuse the elevator with a public toilet.
Here are the corporal punishments - thank you, you don't have to.
For the rest, Singapore’s laws are at least worth looking at.
Nothing sacred?
Now the Trump White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The most reliable sign of a regime change is when it begins to struggle with statues.
Americans understand this no worse than everyone else - hence the deliberate demolition of Saddam Hussein's statue in Firdous Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump administration’s key ideologues, no doubt knew what he was doing when he put a symbolic axe over the Statue of Liberty during a fierce dispute with CNN journalist Jim Acosta over the president’s proposals for a sharp reduction in legal migration.
Let's be honest, Miller didn't try the statue himself.
A lynching of shipowners and artists depicting the Statue of Liberty would have lynched him if he had tried to do so.
But he tried to make sense of it, and especially the meaning that was attributed to it in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, when poems of Emma Lazarus were added to the pedestal.
As Miller whispered to Acosta, “I don’t want to go deep into history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you are talking about was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.
Miller put the facts right, but as he himself said, it’s not really about history.
This is about the current sound of the astonishing words Lazarus, the only one in which the state invites not any immigrants, but the poorest: "Your tired, your poor, / your crowds, dreaming of breathing freely, / the unfortunate wastes of your abundant shores."
“Unfortunate waste” has never been more visible on our screens.
Miller was not involved in literature – he made it clear that in Trump’s America these people are not expected.
This dispute about the meaning of the statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is really a dispute about America’s meaning.
Lazarus—and her friends, who struggled to put her words on the bottom of the statue after her death—were very well aware that they were committing an entirely political act.
The sculpture was intended to mark the connection between the French and American republics with the help of a banal classical figure - the female image of Liberty.
Lazarus changed her meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract, she has a voice.
And she got a completely different name: Mother of the Exiles.
The combination of poetry and image was a brilliant feminist movement and a crushing attack on American nativism.
And as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right wing wanted to change it back.
Loud Rush Limbo, a kind of John the Baptist who announced the arrival of Trump, argued in 2010 that Freedom invites no one, rather she is an early neocon, carrying the flames of America to the dark world: “Freedom is moving forward.
It carries a torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
A torch is not needed to illuminate the way to the United States.”
Against the usual Limbo here really got to the point.
The meaning of the statue depends solely on the angle of view.
The great creative achievement of Lazarus was to see her as she would be seen by exhausted, unhappy, but hopeful people on ship decks after a long and often difficult voyage.
It means literally looking at the world through the eyes of people who seek refuge and a chance for a better life.
Her statue responds to them with the words of hope and hospitality that they dream to hear.
And, of course, this is not the prospect that Miller and Trump will ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch is not needed to illuminate the path, but to inflame hatred, which is the only source of their strength.
World Cup 2017: Neil Blake highly esteems the Scottish members of the UK national team.
Eilid Doyle remembers a time when there were only two Scots in the UK national team
Neil Blake, director of the British Athletics Federation’s game, said the 16-man Scottish squad at the World Cup would make “a significant contribution to the team’s game.”
A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for the 2017 London Championships starting on Friday.
Blake believes that in Scotland "something special is born" and the British Athletics Federation should take this into account.
“We know this and we’re trying to understand it and we’re going to support it as long as they have the potential,” Blake said.
“I’ve spoken to people at the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it’s because of what they’ve done.
The Scottish Athletics Federation thinks that with what they have done, it is necessary to work.
The British Athletics Federation: With what they have done, we have to work.
People on the street think the same.
I don’t know why the circumstances are so, but it’s absolutely brilliant.”
Some of the Scottish athletes claim medals, including Laura Moore and Andrew Bachert - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah at a distance of 5,000 m; and Eilid Doyle's team has chosen their captain.
“Ali is humble.
Her captain's speech was great," Blake said.
"Many athletes, whether they are Scottish or not, and from where they live or train, have come out of this room, feeling proud and in the mood to win.
The passion and sincere feelings that Eilid put into it were remarkable.”
The winner of the Commonwealth Championship silver medal, who will run 400 metres with obstacles at her fifth World Cup, says that 16 Scots in the British national team are "unbelievable".
The previous record for the number of Scots at the World Cup was seven, in 1983 and 2005.
Laura Muir, who specializes in mid-distance running and broke five British and two European records last year, is ahead.
She'll run 1500 and 5000 meters.
Chris O’Hare, who will be competing in the 1500m, is another Scotsman to pay attention to: behind him is a successful season, in which there were victories in the qualifying competitions of the British national team and at the Annual competitions.
Doyle recalls her first World Cup, when besides her the only Scot in the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she is "incredibly proud" of the fact that so many of her compatriots have not only entered the national team, but in some cases will claim medals and fight for the final.
"The captain of the team is chosen by other members of the team, so it was a huge honor anyway, but knowing that your comrades voted for you and you were chosen is a very special thing for me," she added.
"Of course, I am very proud of all the Scots who have joined the team.
It shows how much we have achieved.
And they are all held athletes who will strive to get on the pedestal of honor.
What about my captain's speech?
Yeah, I think she was good.
I just noticed that we were very lucky to host the World Cup at home.
So it’s just about how important it is to get support from the fans and take advantage of the fact that we’ll be at the Olympic Stadium again.
I got another chance to go to his arena and take part in the competitions and the atmosphere there will be just great.”
Facebook Critics’ Blocking: Don’t Stand Up for a Public Position if You’re Unwilling to Listen to Criticism from Voters
The founder of our country understood what a critical press is.
The Americans loved George Washington, but that didn’t stop them from criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
His criticism, of course, irritated him.
But he didn’t shut his mouth to critics.
In 1783, Washington said, “It is possible to deprive freedom of speech, and we, the deaf and dumb, will be led like sheep to the slaughter.”
Now I'm going to go to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who should try to be more like Washington.
Hogan’s subordinates blocked and deleted posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for it.
The governor’s subordinates called the claim null and void, and the comment on the Internet was written in the spirit of “well and what.”
“It’s just Facebook,” many will say.
But it's also important.
And this is especially important when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
He is a remarkably popular Republican governor in a predominantly democratic state.
It is second in the approval rating among 50 governors of the country.
Hogan is not a stubborn reactionary.
He has demonstrated a firm hand in the management of the state and a commitment to its principles.
He also cleverly uses Facebook as the primary way to communicate with his constituents and jokes about his bald head after chemotherapy on his page.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the governor's page - which is declared as an official public forum and is run by the administration for taxpayers' money - is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In an interview with the Washington Post, spokeswoman Amelia Chess defended the governor’s actions, arguing that blocking comments was simply moderating them.
But it's too easy - to use the image of trolls, spammers and haters who are rogue on the Internet.
"Post" spoke to some of the real people that Hogan blocked.
And these are the real people, not the trolls, the teacher, the businessman, the pastor, who address their elected leaders.
They all say that their comments were respectful, substantive and not rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to Hogan to be Catholic.
Lakshmi’s lawyer, Sarma Raman of Bowie, Maryland, did not express hatred, but asked about hate crimes.
“I wrote a polite commentary that I am disappointed by his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news,” she wrote in the comments section of the post.
“I also don’t like the idea that when a lot of people leave comments on the same topic, some immediately say it’s a so-called rant, instead of admitting that they’re dealing with a large group of disgruntled citizens.”
What the governor’s subordinates call a “concentrated spam attack,” others would probably call an “active life stance.”
In the age of Facebook, it’s easy to edit your image by simply blocking critics or deleting negative comments.
This is much less dusty work than before, when it required sending people, collecting and burning newspapers with critical edges, or arresting and shutting down protesters.
But that’s exactly what’s happening now, just in numbers.
Hoggen is not the first official to be criticized for not listening to Facebook and other social networks.
President Trump has been sued by Twitter users who have been banned from his Twitter account.
One of the first, pivotal decisions on this topic was made this week in Virginia.
According to U.S. District Judge James C. Casheris, the chairman of the Laudon County Supervisory Board violated the First Amendment by banning the voter from his Facebook account.
And in Kentucky, Republican Governor Matt Bavin has filed claims by the American Civil Liberties Union for his behavior on Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington’s time, the era of affordable postal spending was about the same as today’s Internet.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers grew fourfold, and the authors of anonymous letters greatly undermined his authority.
And even then Washington was dealing with anonymous trolls.
People under the aliases "Yuricola", "Valerius", "Belizarius" and "Portius" wrote letters to newspapers ridiculing Washington's decision.
According to historical documents compiled by the online George Washington Papers project, his office was flooded with petitions criticizing his stance on the Treaty of Friendship, Trade and Navigation.
But he didn’t try to silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and speech is at the heart of our state.
And true leadership means agreeing to it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home amenities in the club "Renaissance"
Former European champion Ronan Rafferti hopes for home amenities for the next three days when the Renaissance club in East Lotto will host the twenty-fifth Scottish Open golf tournament for senior athletes.
The Northern Ireland native, who led the neighborhood at the Archerfield Links, moved to the final round last year before losing to Paul Ilsa, is attached to the new venue and serves as the tournament representative on behalf of the club's founder and director, Jerry Sarvadi.
“I saw the Renaissance club being built and we are watching it come to success with this event,” Rafferti said.
“The players will see this field at its best, it’s in great condition.
Jerry's done a great job of arranging this place.
He is an avid supporter of this game and is proud of his achievements here.
It’s a great demonstration for this field.”
The Englishman Iles is looking forward to the opportunity to defend the championship for the first time, despite the fact that during his 32-year career he has won both the European tournament and the tournament "European Challenge Tour".
“It’s really a special feeling,” said the Southport player.
“I failed to try again to win the Extremadura Open because it was removed from the schedule a year after I won it.
Going back to this part of the world is magical.
This is a great place to play golf.
The memories of last year are coming back, and for me and my wife Sharon it was a very special impression to win last year.
It was a really special time and we will always remember it.”
He returns to the homeland of Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Athlete Tournament after he turned 50 earlier this year.
This event will be his first public appearance in Scotland since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
“When you play at home, it’s always a little bit more important,” said Helensboro Orr.
“You want to perform well, but you feel that extra burden.”
I was happy to play again, and I showed a good golf.
I’m happy with how things are going so far.”
On the field this trio will join the former winner of the tournament "Masters" Ian Wusnem and the champions of majors for older athletes Paul Brodhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots on the field; the rest are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Participation in the tournament is free, and parking costs <0xC2><0xA3>5 per hour if one person is in the car, and <0xC2><0xA3>10 if the person is two or more.
All proceeds go to the British Prostate Cancer Foundation.
British Roads Will Learn to Absorb Harmful Emissions
The tunnels above the highways, capable of absorbing the carbon dioxide emitted by cars, are already undergoing tests on the roads of the United Kingdom.
The transport agency of the country, according to the edition of Autocar, reported positive results of tests of a 100-meter tunnel installed on one of the highways in the north of the country.
The 6-metre-high tunnel is constructed of some of the latest polymeric materials that are capable of absorbing harmful substances contained in automotive exhausts.
However, the creation of a whole network of such tunnels is only part of the large-scale measures that the UK authorities are going to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the network of tunnels, the British are going to expand the network of charging stations for electric cars, implement a number of measures to reduce road traffic flow, expand the use of commercial transport on electric traction and modernize the fleet of heavy trucks.
According to official statistics, a quarter of all air pollution is caused by transport, and poor air quality causes up to 40,000 premature deaths per year.
Moscow court changed the punishment of disabled Mamaeva to a fine
The Moscow court changed the punishment of the disabled Anton Mamaev, sentenced to four and a half years in the colony, to a fine of 200,000 rubles.
This is reported by TASS.
Earlier, the prosecutor's office asked the court to replace the term with probation, explaining its request that Mamaev's disease "obstructs his being in prison."
28-year-old Anton Mamaev was sentenced to four and a half years in prison with a sentence in a general-regime colony for robbery, the victim of which was a former special forces fighter.
On July 19, the court at the exit meeting in SIZO released the man from custody.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia's 'Golden Land'
When preparing lunch, Bardin Degei does not use the stove.
It is rarely used even in pots.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai County in the rebellious Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually simply places a sweet potato, which here is called a "note", right in the focal point.
After half an hour, the charred tubers are caught and eaten with impatient, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the ground floor – she has no furniture – and it is here that she does her homework, such as washing clothes with muddy water from a nearby swamp.
The bathroom serves as a bucket in a room without a roof.
She is the youngest of her husband’s four wives, so she was not assigned to work in the field.
Plurality is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: many men in this village are unemployed, many drink, and there are soldiers.
“No one decides to walk around the village after five in the evening,” she says.
This is a rare opportunity to look at everyday life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969 after a dubious referendum when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote, publicly raising their hands in front of the occupying troops.
The existing movement for independence from the Netherlands quickly turned its anger against the government of Jakarta, which maintains tight control of the region without allowing foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, and the independent state of Papua New Guinea occupies the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is abandoned; the road here includes a one-and-a-half-hour flight from Jayapur, the administrative center of the province, to Nabir, and then a five-hour shaking in a rental car.
There is no public transport here.
The city with a population of about 19,000 people consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences; corrugated steel roofs are painted with rust in a variety of reddish shades.
Few of the Indonesians, not to mention journalists, and almost none of the foreigners arrived here.
Prior to the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Papuans worshiped a god named Uga Tamei.
There were other changes.
“It was unusual for us to wear this dress,” Degei says, pointing to her bright, hand-woven turban, dark skirt, and bright shirt.
“In the past, we only had leaves on our bodies.”
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of its population living below the poverty line, and child mortality and literacy levels among the worst in Asia.
But it's also Indonesian gold.
The world’s largest and most lucrative gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, is only sixty miles from Paniai, a high-altitude province roughly the size of New Jersey, where 153,000 people live.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined about $3.1 billion in gold and copper.
In addition, Papua boasts forest reserves, the value of which is estimated at $78 billion.
These riches, however, entail one misfortune for the Papuans, ensuring that Indonesia's powerful armed forces retain their stifling presence here.
According to an investigation by the New York Times in 2005, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid local servicemen and units nearly $20 million, including up to $150,000 per officer.
The demands for greater autonomy on the part of the Papuans threaten the existence of this goldmine and are mercilessly suppressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed by Indonesian military forces since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and deprived of their liberty.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the mass killing of indigenous people in the highlands of Papua in the 1970s can be considered genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
“We will lose everything,” the report, published in 2016, by the Diocese of Brisbane, contains evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as executions without trial, torture — especially frequent, as is demonstrated in another report, rape and electric shock.
“It’s hard to count the number of victims because accidents happen every week,” said Andreas Harsono, a researcher in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
Nuts have been protracted as Papua’s resources have attracted influxes of migrants from other areas of Indonesia.
The province’s 3.5 million population is 83% Christian, but demographics change as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the densely populated Indonesian islands of Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javan banks, "varungi", sell fried chicken and a mixture of vegetables "gado-gado", served with peanut sauce.
The locals are trying to keep up with the competition.
“Migrants have started selling chicken and vegetables cheaper in the traditional market than the indigenous people of Papua,” explains Abeth You, a twenty-four-year-old native of Paniai, who moved to Jayapur, the provincial administrative center, for work.
“Because of this, the indigenous people of Papua, the mother-mother (women) of Papua, have lost their market.”
Indonesian President Joko Vidodo, known to the people as Jokowi, vowed to deal with inequality and rights violations in Papua during his 2014 presidential campaign.
On his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, the former carpenter secured the support of 27 of Papua’s 29 counties, including Paniai.
But in Papua almost nothing has changed, and the locals feel loyal.
“Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokovy, expecting him to fulfill our hopes of restoring justice,” Jou said.
In fact, just two months after the October inauguration, Jokovi Paniai experienced the tragedy.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas hymns at the fire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle broke out of the darkness.
The frightened children told them to turn on the headlights.
According to local pastor Javedt Thebai, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone and after a while returned with four soldiers.
According to the victims and witnesses, the soldiers, who were drunk, chased the children and beat them with examples of rifles.
Then one of the soldiers shot at a group of children.
One child, sixteen-year-old Julian Aimo, was so severely beaten that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to a government building near the election commission, and the next day the situation worsened.
About 1,000 Papuan men, women and children gathered on the football field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They brought with them ritual hunting bows and performed the vaita, the dance of the Papuan tribe of Mee Pago: they ran in circles and depicted bird singing.
Some protesters began to throw stones at the police station and military base.
When the situation inflamed, the soldiers on the internal radio were given the order: "If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them", - so he sounded, as stated in the official document, which was seen by the correspondents of the magazine "TIME", but which was not published in the local.
Fifty-six-year-old Eremias Kayama, the head of the Kego Koto district in Enarotali, felt the approach of danger and called for calm, appealing to the crowd with a request to disperse around the house.
No one wanted to listen to him.
“When I turned, I suddenly got a bullet in my left wrist,” he told TIME magazine, standing on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot, but says the bullet came from the sherring of the assembled soldiers.
“There was a crowd, there were a lot of shots,” he adds.
The local resident Alfius Jouva was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
“I ran up to him and examined his body to make sure it was him,” Johanes, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name, told TIME magazine.
“I saw that he was dead...I kissed him.”
General Yotge Mende, Papua’s senior police inspector, told reporters that his officers were only “defending” their base because it was under attack.
“We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us,” said Papua Police Commissioner Pujo Sulistio in 2015.
“It’s a matter of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters have been killed and many more injured.
The news of the murders reached Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi delivered a heartfelt speech in Jayapur in which he expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and vowed to address the issue of historic abuses of power in Papua.
“I want this situation to be resolved immediately, so that it will never happen again in the future,” he said.
In October 2016, Security Minister Viranto said he would establish a non-judicial organization to put an end to historic human rights violations.
But almost immediately there were excuses.
“Most of the violations happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s or early 1990s.
The fact is that we certainly want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures that need to be followed,” he said.
Viranto then renounced his words, speaking to Time magazine on June 5 in Jakarta, and said he did not plan to set up an organization to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, “Everything will be decided through the court.”
Viranto, who was accused by the United Nations of "crimes against humanity" in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people during the bloody 1999 independence vote in East Timor, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the victims from Paniai encountered such statements with murky mistrust.
“I have been questioned four times over the past three years, but there has been absolutely no change,” says Johannes.
“I am tired.”
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
“I’m scared,” he says.
“I’m afraid I’m going to be arrested by the military, I’m afraid I’m going to be shot.”
His brother Jacobus also expressed the opinion that the inhabitants of Pannaya were afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after he helped bury the four victims.
“After we buried the bodies, the military came after me,” he says.
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired at villagers in the Paniai district of Deiyai.
During the clash between the villagers and the manager of the construction company, who refused to help bring a man who was unconscious to the hospital, one person died and another 17 were injured, including children.
A man, twenty-four-year-old Ravianus Dove, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the office of the construction site owned by the company.
According to police, the villagers threw stones at officers, who in response fired warning shots.
But locals claim that the mobile brigade (Indonesian special forces) started shooting at the crowd and killed one person.
“We were in such a panic, we are afraid of retribution,” twenty-nine-year-old Domingu Badia, who lives near the hospital, told TIME magazine and saw how they were rushing to deliver the wounded.
“I hid at home for two days.”
Deijai demanded that the officers involved in the incident be called to account and the mobile police brigade recalled from the region.
Paniai has always been a sick place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of significant development is caused by the dissatisfaction of the Mee, Monks, Dani and Damal tribes scattered throughout the green central highland areas of Papua.
Many have joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to defend Papuan rights by arranging sporadic attacks and assaults with kidnappings on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the senior OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yoga and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested and unjustifiably detained in Paniai in recent years under the pretext of “protecting national independence.”
Some of them never came back.
Among the population of Papua, Paniai is considered a “sad, forgotten place”.
Poverty intensifies discontent.
A small portion of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is not available to the same extent.
People here grow everything they eat: mostly a note, as well as some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of whom can care for four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, and the rest is sold at the local market.
Ten club notes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic disparities between indigenous Papuans and new migrants, who arrived in large numbers after the introduction of new flights to the airport of Nabire, have increased.
Few existing vacancies are usually given to more educated and wealthy migrants.
Papuans rarely have enough money or skills to run their own competitive business.
“Young people don’t want to stay in the village ... because there is no work or money here,” says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Isolation keeps Papua away from the rest of the world.
In addition, restrictions on the work of the international media remain strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudi and Basil Longshan were deported from Papua for “insufficient coherence with the relevant organizations” despite being granted rare video recording permits.
According to Felim Kine, deputy director for Asia at Human Rights Watch, the promises made during the Jokovi campaign to lift restrictions on the work of the media in order to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
“Now, foreign journalists trying to report from the rebellious eastern provinces of Indonesia, Papua and West Papua, face new dangers: visa waivers and blacklisting,” he said in a statement.
The lack of attention from the press means that international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is largely limited to Papua’s immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific states – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands – appealed to the UN Human Rights Council to investigate “diverse and widespread violations” in Papua, including the shooting in Panaya.
The same countries have supported OPM in the past.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arramanat Nasir declined the group’s statement, telling reporters in Jakarta that “In Indonesia there is still a democratic system and there is a free press, so it would be difficult to hide evidence of human rights violations.”
Locals want more foreign governments to pay attention to the situation.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by Dutch human rights ambassador Kees Van Baaar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke the silence, please: “We want freedom”, as the source, who was also present at the meeting, claims, but wanted to stay.
Indonesia will hold new presidential elections in 2019, but the Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Djokovic again.
“The Jokowi are a man who has good intentions, but is surrounded by people involved in the shooting in Paniai,” said Gobai, chairman of the tribe’s council.
He wants Djokovic to know that the inhabitants of Paniai, in addition to living in the shadow of the threat from the greedy army, are plunged into poverty, and their education and health care are in a miserable state.
Gobai says that the people of Paniai, like other Papuans, consider their voice given to Jokovi to be a debt that he has to pay.
“They don’t need money, they just want justice,” he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the shooting in Paniai carried out the last symbolic act of disobedience: they buried the body of one of the victims in the plot of land directly opposite the police and military station.
Knowing that justice will probably never prevail, they will at least not allow the guilty to forget their crimes.
“They killed a member of our family,” Jacobus says without raising his head.
“What else did we have to do?”
The fire for the second time covers the Dubai skyscraper "Fakel"
The fire engulfed one of the world’s tallest residential skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to leave the seventy-seven-story structure 337 meters high.
This is the second fire that has struck a high-rise building – which is coincidentally called “The Torch” – in two years.
The building was evacuated, human casualties were not reported, and there was no operational news of the cause of the fire.
“We slept and woke up from the fire alarm and the screams of the people.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about ten minutes to get down from the fiftieth floor,” a skyscraper resident named George told Reuters.
According to the Civil Defense Administration of the city of Dubai, firefighters extinguished the fire at about 4:00 a.m. local time (00:00 a.m. Greenwich time) and cooled the building.
The government said it was working on providing asylum to the victims.
The incident could return to the agenda security issues of materials used in the exteriors of high-rise buildings around the world.
In the course of an investigation by the Fakela administration after the fire there in 2015, it was found that the plaque suffered the most – external panels used for decoration and insulation.
In the United Kingdom, police said they believed the insulation system and plasterboard at the Grenfell Tower in London could have accelerated the spread of the June fire that killed about 80 people.
The growth of tourist flow in Ida-Virumaa in June turned out to be minimal
According to the data received by the correspondent of the portal rus.err.ee in the Department of Statistics, in June 2017, a total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists benefited from the services of the hotel companies of the North-East, which is 125 people or 0.6% more than in the same period a year earlier.
At the same time, the number of local tourists decreased and foreign tourists increased.
Thus, the foreign tourist flow increased in June by 7.3% (544 people) to 7994 tourists.
And the number of local tourists decreased by 3.2% from 12,944 to 12,525 people.
The most noticeable increase in the number of Russian tourists in the region - by 8.9% or by 318 people compared to June 2016.
In June 2017, 3885 guests from Russia stayed in Ida-Virumaa hotels for the night.
Andrei Malakhov made it clear to fans who are to blame for his care
Andrey Malakhov hinted to his fans on Instagram who are to blame for his departure from the "First" channel.
So far, he has not commented on the rumors, but today posted a fragment of the article of the newspaper "Vedomosti" for August 1.
Photo Malakhov signed the tag "boss milkshake".
An article on how to prevent the "burning" of an employee and pay attention to his condition.
If you remember the numerous reports that the leader could not find a common language with the newly arrived producer, who began to reformat "Let's Talk", it becomes clear what he so transparently hinted at, writes "KP".
As reported, TV host Andrey Malahov is currently on vacation and has not signed an application for dismissal from the First Channel.
The situation with the dismissal could be cleared up in the coming days.
In Afghanistan, five soldiers were killed in a car bombing.
At least five soldiers died in the explosion in the Afghan province of Guilmande, reports RIA Novosti.
According to police, last night near the military checkpoint in the county of Girishk exploded a mine-laden car.
There are 20 known dead.
On Friday morning, a new emergency occurred in Girishka.
The armed criminals attacked the currency exchange point.
The shooting between the attackers and the security forces continues.
Diver filmed a video of a shark biting his camera
Diver and researcher Greg Skomal filmed a video of a shark biting his GoPro action camera.
The video was posted on Facebook by a division of the U.S. Maritime Fisheries Agency in Massachusetts, an employee of which is Skomal.
The incident occurred on August 2 off the coast of the Cape Cod Peninsula in the northeastern United States, according to the Necn portal.
The man, while diving, tried to remove the shark on the camera, which he held on a special stick.
When a man noticed, an animal more than three meters in length swam towards him.
The shark began to bite the camera, while not trying to attack the scientist.
Skomal explained that the predator acted in this way to determine whether the gadget was edible.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the device.
He also noted that such behavior of a marine animal was a novelty for scientists.
The cause of the mass fighting in the Ural military center became known
A working group of senior officers of the Central Military District arrived at the Elan Training Center, where a mass fighting took place, to investigate the circumstances of the incident.
Some details of this massacre have already become known.
According to the public Mash, who appeared on the page "VKontakte", the contractors of the Ural military unit number 31612 fought fiercely because of the unopened bed.
It all started with the fact that an officer named Saiyan demonstratively ignored the officer's order to fill the hanging sheet.
On the side of the officer stood the soldiers of the sixth company.
Sayana supported the first company.
In half an hour, 140 young men were smashed in the barracks beds and sinks, knocked out glasses.
More than 10 people were injured in the mass fighting.
The CSO denied the information about the knife.
The study found that at least one-fifth of passengers in the U.S. carry prohibited items on planes.
The study found that more than 20 percent of air passengers deliberately or accidentally carried prohibited items on board a plane through U.S. Transportation Safety Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 percent boarded the plane, uninspected, carrying prohibited knives or other sharp objects.
Nearly 1 percent reported that they later discovered that they had accidentally carried firearms, ammunition or explosives.
A study conducted by Stratos Jet Charters, Inc., which involved more than 1,000 people, also found that young passengers were more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they deliberately tried to fly with something that was banned by the ATB, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared to less than 15 percent of Generation X members.
Consciously, ATP employees most often carry food and water.
More than 3 per cent admitted to having specially carried through the examination of sharp objects, and 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents admitted to knowingly carrying prohibited drugs on the plane.
The company said it surveyed passengers across the country to find out how many of them were accidentally smuggled through airport checks and how many were deliberately smuggled.
It is expected that most often - consciously or unconsciously - drag smuggling through inspection those who fly the most.
As the company points out, the rules of ATB are quite complex and confusing.
People often do not know exactly what liquids they can carry and in what amount.
Therefore, it is not surprising that most of what ATP selects are prohibited liquids.
Some time ago, people thought that the ATB could consider the book to be prohibited from being transported.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Head of EPA Pruitt Rejects Intention to Delay Compliance with Obama’s Emissions Reduction Rules
The day after the 15-state lawsuit, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency reversed his decision to postpone the implementation of Obama's rules aimed at reducing emissions of polluting substances that lead to the formation of smog.
Pruitt explained his decision by saying that his agency now listens more than in previous administrations to the needs of individual states’ environmental regulators.
He did not mention the lawsuit against his previous position filed with the Federal Court of Appeal.
The dispute unfolded around the October 1 deadline, to which states must ensure compliance with the 2015 ground-level ozone standards.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would defer their compliance by one year to give his office more time to study the plan and avoid “non-compliance with local decisions or obstacles to economic growth.”
Pruitt, who before he was appointed by President Trump to his current position, was the Attorney General of Oklahoma, has long been known as a consistent opponent of tightening environmental standards.
After moving to Washington, Pruitt repeatedly blocked or postponed the introduction of norms that the chemical or gas-oil industry opposed.
The unexpected change of course on Wednesday is another legal defeat of the course taken by Pyuitt to return to the old norms.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the head of the EPA exceeded his authority in trying to delay the Obama administration’s enforcement of a rule requiring oil and gas companies to track and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that by abruptly changing course on ozone standards, he was simply fulfilling the EPA’s duty to cooperate with states in a comprehensive process of timely implementation of the new standards.
“In previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet the deadlines set, then awaited lawsuits from activist groups and others, and discussed the deadlines in the course of the settlement,” said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the EPA in his previous post.
“We don’t believe in regulation through court proceedings, and we take the deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously our charter and the power it gives us.”
However, the EPA statement said that Pruitt could at some point re-use its “deferral powers and other data by law” to make sure that the rules “jcyjdfys on a clear course and on all available information.”
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader revision of the rules on ozone.
The bill, approved by the House of Representatives last month, seeks to postpone the implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on this issue.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that filed lawsuits against the EPA this week, said the group intends to continue legal pressure.
“Changing the EPA’s course – after our lawsuits – is an important victory in the fight for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog covering their cities,” Schneiderman said.
New York was joined by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, as well as the District of Columbia.
Ozone at ground level occurs when conventional pollutants from machines, power plants, oil refineries, and chemical plants and other sources enter the atmosphere in response to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause severe breathing problems in people sensitive to it, leading to thousands of premature deaths a year.
Health advocates and environmentalists welcomed the unexpected change in Pruitt’s course.
“It’s sad to think about how much pressure it took to achieve this perfectly logical step from the person assigned to protect the air we breathe,” said Lori Ann Bird of the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to resist the Trump administration’s ideological campaign and protect those who pollute the air and their special interests.”
IAAF Congress extends the suspension of the All-Russian Athletics Federation
The Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) voted to extend the suspension of the All-Russian Athletics Federation (VFLA).
Thus, Congress backed the IAAF Council on the Restoration of VFLA, which issued a report on Monday recommending that the suspension remain in effect.
166 people voted for the extension of the suspension, against - 21, reports TASS.
The report of the IAAF Board stated that VFLA had made significant progress towards meeting the conditions set by the Board for Membership Reconstruction, but these conditions had not yet been fully met.
Due to the disqualification of VFLA at the World Championships in London, Russian athletes were forced to compete under a neutral flag.
The team consisted of 19 people admitted to the IAAF championship.
VFLA was disqualified indefinitely by the IAAF in 2015.
Then was published the report of the independent expert of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Dick Pound, which mentioned the numerous violations of the WADA regulations committed by Russian officials and athletes.
For more information on the IAAF’s latest report, see “IAAF Extended Sanctions on UFLA.”
Violent defeat
As part of the 3rd round of the Fonbet Championship of Russia among the PFL teams, the Novomoskovsky "Khimik" held a away match against FC "Kaluga".
Just over 10 days ago, rivals played each other in the Russian Cup, but this time the picture of the game was completely different.
"Chemist" did not give in to the opponent, but a second relaxation at the end of the match led to an offensive goal and a fiasco.
After the recent defeat of the bats with a score of 0:3, many predicted an easy victory of the hosts in advance.
However, since the beginning of the meeting, the Novomoskovskys were forced to reckon with themselves and acted from the defense, but from a position of strength.
In the first half, the bats created more and had an advantage in possession of the ball.
Another very high-quality match was held by Alexei Sirotin, who repeatedly reflected dangerous blows and gave confidence to his partners with his actions.
Unfortunately, in the attack "Chemistry" lacked effort and luck to put a stop to the defense of "Kaluga" and score the first goal at the departure.
After the break, the game began to run on opposite courses.
The Novomoskovs played more actively in the attack.
The alarming bells for our team were errors in defense, which allowed the moles to create a number of sharp moments.
Ten minutes before the end of the meeting, the Chemist intercepted the territorial advantage and carried out several dangerous attacks.
But the experience of the sausages played a role - they spent the end more competently and coolly, waiting for their moment to take the gate.
After a dangerous attack "Chemist" transferred the ball to the corner, the feed of which the owners of the field without resistance transferred to the goal.
The author of the goal was Yuri Dubrovin.
In the reporting meeting "Chemist" showed a good game, but suffered an offensive defeat.
In front of our team is waiting for another departure - on August 11 at 7 pm in Moscow at the stadium "Torpedo" named after Eduard Streltsov, the Novo-Moscow team will fight with the favorite of the group "Centre" FC "Ararat", which includes Roman Pavlyuchenko, Marat Izmailov, Igor Lebedenko.
Come and support the chemist!
The place and time of the meeting of the Novomoskivs - 18:30 min. near the store "Magnolia" (East, D.2, Korp.
Composition "Chemistry": Sirotin, Manokhin (k), Romashchenko, Shayunov, Khumutov, Gogiya (Oreshkin), Dudaiti, Ryzhov, Svyatov, Belyanin (Adoevtsev), Andreychenko (Lygin)

According to the published decryption of telephone conversations, Trump pressed Mexico about the payment of the wall at the border
The Washington Post published decryptions of telephone conversations between U.S. President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, during a phone conversation with Mexican President Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, Trump insisted that he stop publicly declaring that he would not pay for the planned wall at the border.
The U.S. president denounced him for publicly speaking against the wall and, according to leaked information, told him, “You can’t tell the press that.”
Trump began his election campaign with a promise to build a wall along the southern U.S. border and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
A published decryption of his first telephone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull also revealed a hot streak.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the U.S. should take in refugees heading to Australia was “ridiculous,” “disgusting,” and “stupid,” and insisted that because of the deal the U.S. administration has signed, it will look like an idiot to the Obama administration.
Trump ended the conversation by telling Turnbull that “it was the most unpleasant conversation in the whole day.”
The bodies of the dead in Abkhazia tourists sent by plane from Sochi to St. Petersburg
The plane, owned by the airline "Russia", on board which are the bodies of the dead in Abkhazia Russian women, flew at 20:15 Moscow time from Sochi to St. Petersburg, reports TASS.
At the site of the final point of follow-up, the board will meet the employees of the ritual agency, as well as representatives of the city's city hall, Deputy Minister of Resorts and Tourism of Abkhazia Astamyr Ahba told reporters.
Earlier, representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic said that all the costs associated with the delivery of bodies back to Russia were borne by the government of Abkhazia.
In addition, the official Sukhum intends to pay the families of the victims compensation in the amount of 500,000 rubles.
According to Ahba, the leadership of Abkhazia expressed willingness to pay relatives of those killed as a result of the explosions of tourists flights and stay in the republic, but relatives sent to the republic only the powers on the right of local authorities to act in accordance with the established procedure.
On August 2, at about 16:20 Moscow time, two explosions occurred in the village of Primorsky Gudautsky District in the missile and artillery weapons warehouse of the Ministry of Defense of the Republic, after which the large-caliber projectiles and other munitions stored there began to detonate.
As a result, there was a fire in the warehouse, which provoked uncontrolled explosions of projectiles of various modifications.
As a result of the emergency, two Russian citizens died - Elena Polyakova born in 1970 and Elena Timofeev born in 1962, who were on vacation near a hydrogen sulfide source.
64 people, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 citizens of Abkhazia, with injuries of varying severity were brought to medical institutions of the Republic.
There are currently seven people in the hospital, the rest are discharged.
The study of the Russian influence on the American elections will be taken by a large jury
Special Prosecutor for Russia Robert Mueller has convened a grand jury in Washington, which will study Russia’s influence on the 2016 U.S. presidential election, The Wall Street Journal and Reuters reported.
The grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offences and have the right to interrogate witnesses under oath.
The materials collected will be examined by the Special Prosecutor and will decide whether they are sufficient to file an indictment.
The convening of a grand jury gives Müller additional powers to collect testimony.
One of the investigations of the jury, which began several weeks ago, will be the details of the meeting of the son of the then presidential candidate Donald Trump with the Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
To check the details of this meeting, held in June 2016, Mueller himself promised earlier.
They're already under investigation by the FBI.
At the end of July, it was reported that Donald Trump Jr. expanded the staff of his lawyers.
Trump-younger previously said that from the meeting with Veselnitsa he was waiting for a compromise at the headquarters of the candidate from the Democratic Party Hillary Clinton, but no explanatory documents were presented, and the speech was ultimately about adoption.
In early August, a number of media outlets reported that Trump Jr.’s statement about a meeting with Veselnitsa was literally dictated by Trump Sr.
The White House said the president did not dictate anything, but simply used his authority, which any father would do.
Deputy Mayor of Penza was detained in the workplace
Deputy head of the Penza administration Irina Shirshina is detained for 48 hours on behalf of the Investigative Committee at her workplace, reports RIA Novosti.
Official reports from law enforcement agencies on this matter have not yet been received, but the press service of the Supreme Court of Kazakhstan has assured that they will follow soon.
The city of Penza has not yet commented on what happened.
Irina Shirshina is one of the five deputy heads of the Penza administration.
She has been in charge of urban planning and land relations, holding this position since April 2015.
Prior to that, she worked for a long time as the head of the Department of State Building Inspection in the Penza region.
Irina Shirshina raises three underage children, it is noteworthy that once again becoming a mother a year ago, she gave up maternity leave and returned to work.
Of course, there is no spaceport or rocket launcher in Mexico.
But there is a space agency established in 2010 and a desire to develop its own space program.
And the installation of the bust of Yuri Gagarin is a tribute to the first person who visited in space.
Unlike Soviet-era monuments, which are demolished in some countries, monuments to Gagarin, on the contrary, "walk around the planet".
In 2012, the monument was erected in the American city of Houston near NASA’s former headquarters.
In London, a monument on the territory of the Royal Observatory was installed in honor of the 50th anniversary of the first flight into space.
There is a monument to Gagarin in Germany in the city of Erfut, where our astronaut visited in 1963.
The monument in Karlovy Vary (Czech Republic) escaped demolition in 1992 due to public protests and was moved from the city center to the square in front of the local airport.
In the year of the 70th anniversary of Gagarin, a monument to Yuri Gagarin appeared in Riga.
This is how the name and surname of the first cosmonaut in Latvian sounds, and he looks as if he was 70 years old.
Morse Ford Murder: Activists Lose Lynch Courts on Stage to Call for Justice
In 1948, Ford Mercury drove past the spectators in the village of Monroe in the state of Georgia and ran to the small Morse Ford Bridge.
When the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, arrived at the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked her way.
The main - a middle-aged man in a suit in a thin strip - stretched his cigar and looked through the windshield.
Those inside were trembling with fear.
"We need this nigger, Roger!" the man squealed.
"Get him out of the car!"
Pervasive screams broke the silence when a young black man was pulled from the front seat.
Fortunately, this horrible scene, which took place on July 22, is just a staging.
But when Roger's neck was looped, almost all the spectators really took their breath away.
Since 2005, activists have returned to the Morse Ford Bridge to lose again on the night that the doll clans lynched two black couples – Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and May Murray Dorsey – in 1946.
No one has been convicted of these murders.
“It’s astonishing that no one has been arrested in all these years — even though we see them next to us; even though we know who they are,” says Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the production.
“This is a stain on our history and a stone on our souls.”
The 71-year-old Brooks is a former member of Congress of Georgia who has been fighting for human rights his entire life.
For him, the play is a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the people of Monroe that injustice has never been corrected.
“We want investigations, we want completions, we want healings, we want reconciliation, but first we have to achieve justice,” he said.
“We can’t go to healing and reconciliation until we get justice.”
The coroner covers the body of one of the victims of the lynching at Morse Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI material obtained by NSA News, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighboring counties were suspected of involvement in lynchings.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although the suspects have remained at large for decades, human rights activists say the city has always known two related motives of lynchings: politics and sex.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court’s decision allowed black citizens to vote for the primaries that were to take place that summer.
About the same election, according to the FBI, black exploiter Roger Malcolm struck a knife in a fight with Barnett Hester, a white landowner apparently because of a woman.
Brooks says that, according to rumors spread in the city, Hester slept with Malcolm Dorothy's wife, and that the child she was to give birth to was not from her husband.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a large white landowner, paid $600 in collateral to free Malcolm from prison.
He went to prison with Dorothy and their cousins May Murray and George Dorsey.
But as they drove out of prison and came to Morse Ford Bridge, a mob of lynchmen surrounded the car.
“It turns out that he organized and commanded the killings of Harrison,” one of the FBI’s reports said.
“It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and city law enforcement agencies that not only participated in the killings, but also destroyed the evidence and hid the identities of the witnesses.”
Brooks calls it shorter.
“It was an attempt on electoral rights,” he said.
“They were all killed to send a signal to the blacks in the city: if you register and vote, you will be the same.”
For almost ten years, Cassandra Green has directed an annual spectacle reproducing the lynching at the Morse Ford Bridge.
Her performance is visual, it captivates the viewer and tells of that deep racism, which, as many would like to believe, is no more in America.
It’s hard to see and even harder to turn away, but Green believes that’s the main thing.
“We don’t want to talk about the Lynch courts because they show us our own ugliness,” she says.
“But I can’t build a relationship with you if you don’t hear me or hear what I’ve been through.”
This year’s rehearsals began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors – a dozen white, the rest black – gathered in the room and listened to a polished overview of the play over the years.
Wade Marbo was the director with Greene.
He played the role of chief member of the clan for several years, but says the role has never been easier.
“I feel like I’m messed up because he’s not the person I am,” Marbo says.
“But I think it’s very important to remember this story because we don’t want to go back to that time.”
In the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, repeat their roles.
The show begins with Malcolm, angry that Hester is sleeping with his wife Dorothy, screaming and pushing him.
"I said, nigga, get out of my house!"
Screams Raccoon in response.
It's a blow.
And at the same time, everyone (at least all the black actors) is annoyed by the hoax.
Green laughs the loudest.
"What is that?" asked Ascona.
He's worried and embarrassed.
Am I overplaying?
“No,” Green said with a laugh.
“I just don’t think white people used to say ‘nigga’.”
“Yes,” one of the black performers laughed.
"You have to wear a solid 'r'."
And so does the energy in the room: discomfort is replaced by a sense of companionship.
Everyone should do everything right, not only for the play, but also for the memory of four people killed.
The scene begins first.
This time, when Raskona speaks the word "n", it becomes clear and sharp.
No one is laughing.
The show ends violently and quickly.
Screams, shots, and then silence.
A woman in mournful black clothes stands above the actors’ bodies and performs Billy Holiday’s sad song “Strange Fruit.”
Her voice is interrupted by a word.
In a hundred yards from it, half a hundred spectators wipe tears and sweat from their eyes.
Among the spectators almost equal number of blacks and whites.
One couple came from Ithaca, New York to watch the show; many live very close by.
They all endured the heavy spirit of Georgia for almost eight hours while Brooks led them on a pilgrimage to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until then, the murders were history, but now that they are standing in the same place where people were lynched, it seems that their ghosts are floating right in the air.
When the last note of the song is quiet, Green invites people to come closer and look at the bodies.
Children bow to their heads, touch the paint depicting blood, and the motionless bodies and whisper something to each other.
“They’re not really dead,” one little boy mutters, as if to remind himself of it.
In a few minutes, Green thanks the audience, and all of a sudden it ends.
The actors throw the ropes from the neck and wipe the tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbo, the man in the costume who played the main puppeteer.
Nick Rascona hugs the other two actors and suddenly, crying, falls into their arms: the emotional load of the show has finally fallen on him.
"It's all right," whispered one of the women.
“We know your heart is good.
You had a reason for that.”
Later, the spectators sit down to dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta is busy discussing a show with a black couple they’ve just met.
Deniza Daplinski struggles to find words to describe what she feels after the performance.
“It’s hard to listen to those horrible, horrible words and actions... people who look like you and who do it because they look like you,” she says.
“After that, I think the lynchings are still going on,” she adds, “but now it’s called what the police are shooting.”
In the other corner of the room, Tyrone Brooks, who remembers his work as a human rights defender, received general attention.
He says he has already begun planning for next year’s show.
“The production inspires us because it not only describes the horror of what we have experienced, but also teaches us,” he says.
“Because if you don’t learn from this lesson, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their history, who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it.”
The court fined Navalny for violations on the "agitation Saturday"
The Simonov court of Moscow fined Alexei Navalny 300,000 rubles for violating the order of organizing the rally.
The opposition member was found guilty of the administrative offence provided for in Article 20.2 of the Russian Civil Code, No. 8, “Repetitive violation of the order of organization of the rally”.
Earlier, the judge of the Simonovskiy court of Moscow Hyzyr Mussakayev ended the administrative case against Leonid Volkov - the head of the opposition's headquarters Alexei Navalny, who was brought to justice under the same article as Navalny.
Volkov was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300,000 rubles.
In this amount, Judge Mussakayev estimated the distribution of leaflets on the "agitation Saturday", which Navalny's supporters held in Moscow on July 8-9.
After seeing the agitation materials that followed the participants of the Saturday, the police believed that the organizers of the event intentionally hid its true essence - a public action (for which it is necessary to ask for permission from the capital authorities in advance).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers Ivan Zhdanov and Alexander Pomazuev requested the termination of administrative proceedings due to the absence of the composition of the offence and indicated that the police had made certain errors in the drafting of the protocol.
Volkov was not detained on the "agitation Saturday" itself, but he received an agenda obliging him to appear at the police station to tell about the event held during his active participation.
The same agendas were received by Navalny himself and another colleague of the opposition - Nikolai Lyaskin.
In Mordovia, the shooter of the bride and three guests of the wedding
A court in Mordovia has arrested a local man who shot four people at a wedding, including a bride.
This was reported in the Republican administration of the Investigative Committee.
The incident occurred on the evening of July 29.
During the dispute, the 42-year-old resident of Saransk fired several shots at guests of events that came to the rural pond to bathe.
As a result, three women and one man were injured.
A criminal case has been initiated under paragraph "a" of part 1 of Article 213 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation ("Hooliganism"), part 3 of Article 30 and paragraphs "a", "e", "and" of part 2 of Article 105 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation ("Attempt to murder two or more persons, committed in a general dangerous manner, from hooligan motives").
According to Interfax, local media reported that the man opened the shooting due to the fact that the wedding guests, having decided to bathe, passed through the territory of his plot to the pond.
The Ministry of Energy will tighten the requirements for suppliers of turbines for power plants
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation will update the rules for providing information by suppliers of critical equipment, in particular turbines for power plants.
With the launch of gas turbines, turbines, oil pumping facilities and oil production equipment suppliers will be obliged to share data on access to it with the Ministry of Energy and the Federal Service for Technical and Export Control.
The Government’s draft resolution is now ready for public discussion.
The new requirements will only affect “critical energy equipment” delivered to Russia.
Potential threats in the document are phenomena such as obtaining information and access to the management of the object by foreign intelligence services, criminal elements and structures, unscrupulous partners and hackers.
EU extends anti-Russian sanctions over Siemens
The press service of the European Union on August 4 said that the anti-Russian sanctions were extended due to the scandal around the supply of turbines produced by "Simens" in the Crimea.
This was previously reported "Arguments of the week".
The press service of the Council of the EU said that the sanctions against the Russian Federation have been extended due to the scandal with the turbines of the production of "Simens", which were allegedly delivered to the Crimea in circumvention of the sanctions.
Today, the Council of Europe is considering all possible complaints and proposals from member countries on the expansion of anti-Russian sanctions.
Earlier it was reported that the final decision will be made before the end of the current day, and the decision has been made, sanctions against Russia have been extended.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts dividends to bring business back to life
On Friday, Pearson, a British education group, announced it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut the amount of preliminary dividends by 72 percent due to the start of another restructuring program aimed at tackling the problems facing their businesses.
These job cuts, which CEO John Fallon says will mostly occur in late 2018 and early 2019, are in addition to 4,000 jobs cuts from previous restructurings.
Pearson said it plans to cut costs by another <0xC2><0xA3>300 million ($394 million) in May during its third cost-cutting program to try to revive a business that has been hit by a rapid shift to digital learning.
The company, which last month agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner, Bertelsman, said its forecasts for the year remained unchanged after announcing a 1 percent increase in sales of the main product in the first half of the year to 2.05 million.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing
According to official sources, a suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
Five soldiers and a translator were injured, NATO said in a statement.
According to unconfirmed data from local sources, three civilians were also killed as a result of the incident in the urban area of Karabakh.
The blast was the latest to hit Afghanistan this month: more than 30 people were killed in the explosion at a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO, the explosion, which occurred on Thursday evening, occurred when a joint convoy with the Afghan army was attacked with the help of a "man-made man-made explosive device".
According to the report, all the wounded are in stable condition and receiving treatment at the US military hospital at Bagrama Airport.
The growing power of the Taliban and a group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Karabakh is a major source of concern for NATO forces stationed nearby in Bagram.
According to UN reports, in the first half of 2017, at least 1,662 civilian casualties occurred in Afghanistan, and about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bombing killed at least 30 people in the Shia area of Kabul.
The Taliban said they carried out the attack.
More than 150 people were killed in a massive explosion in the city centre on May 31, the country’s most serious terror attack since U.S.-led forces removed the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence accentuates the unreliable situation in Afghanistan, while U.S. President Donald Trump is assessing whether to increase the number of U.S. military forces providing assistance to troops and police in the country.
The attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the government, its lines of conduct, and especially the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
The Environmental Protection Agency after the lawsuits cancels the decision to postpone the adoption of the law on air pollution
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reversed its decision to postpone the passage of the Obama-era law, which requires states to limit emissions of air pollutants a day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
On Wednesday evening, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called “ozone measurements – 2015”, stressing that this step shows the agency’s willingness to cooperate with the states.
“We believe in dialogue with and responsiveness to our partners in the states,” said Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency.
In June, Pruitt announced the Environmental Protection Agency’s intention to postpone measurements of ozone, in which existing air pollution is measured in different parts of the country to determine where it needs to be reduced to meet more stringent air purity standards by 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly democratic, along with the federal district of Colombia filed a lawsuit alleging that the intent was illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump is trying to roll back a wide range of environmental protection resolutions introduced by former President Barack Obama, as part of a broader program aimed, according to Trump, at brilliant economic growth.
But action in this direction has prompted resistance from Democrats and environmental organizations concerned about the possible impact of large emissions on public health.
The Environmental Protection Agency’s website states that the use of ozone-containing air for breathing “may impair lung function and intensify respiratory symptoms”, such as asthma.
Association of European Business Opposed New Anti-Russian Sanctions
The Association of European Business expressed its disagreement with the economic sanctions of the United States against the Russian Federation.
According to AEB, such measures can lead to a serious reduction in production and the number of jobs.
Business is one of the important linkages between countries and people, so the principles of free trade cannot be restricted.
The European business unites more than 500 companies from the countries of the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls on the heads of states and governments of the EU, the US and Russia to develop a new line of conduct that would allow businesses to be separated from politics and find a common, mutually acceptable solution in a spirit of peace and harmony.
Deputies ask the police to restrict traffic on the promenade in Pskow
The Pskov people's elected representatives addressed the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the city Sergei Surin on the problem of movement along the river Velika.
Pride deputies Konstantin Bolotin, Grigory Storonenkov and Valery Lesnikov believe that motorists prevent people from walking and resting in this place.
In their opinion, the control of the drivers will help to make this territory more peaceful and safe.
The problem is that the violators ignore the signs of the "Pedestrian Trail" and freely ride on the embankment.
It turns out that major repairs and improvements have been carried out in vain.
Sports and children's playgrounds due to cars become uncomfortable.
According to the Pskov Information Agency, in the evenings the central promenade is patrolled by the employees of the motor patrol of the PPS and friends.
Thanks to them, the number of passing cars becomes smaller, but the movement does not stop completely.
Putin urges investigative authorities not to remove hard drives
Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed banning investigative bodies from removing servers and hard drives from working computers at enterprises.
The head of state said this at the meeting on investment programs of development of the Far East.
According to the president, it is necessary to "exclude the use in the interest of investigation measures that lead to the suspension of activities of enterprises, including the seizure of hard drives from working computers and servers."
Putin noted that if investigators have such a need, "it is enough to take copies, to certify them and to use them during the investigation."
The head of state added that it is impossible to "create conditions that prevent the continuation of the activity of the enterprise until the impossibility of paying taxes".
Olga Buzova told how much she wanted to call her ex-husband
TV host Olga Buzova admitted that she really wanted to call her ex-husband - footballer Dmitry Tarasov.
Currently, the celebrity is in the United States, where he deals with work issues.
Literally the day before, Olga visited Las Vegas, after which she decided to post on the social network Instagram.
She said she didn’t get married, didn’t make new tattoos, and didn’t name her ex-husband with the words that he ruined her life, even though she really wanted to do it.
Buzova said that she will remember this trip forever, because she had a great time.
British actor Robert Hardy has died.
British actor Robert Hardy, who played the minister of magic Cornelius Faj in the screenplay of a series of novels about Harry Potter, died at the age of 92.
This was reported by the newspaper "Independent" on Thursday.
The actor's death was reported by his relatives.
According to them, he has lived a "huge life, achieving success in film, theater and television over 70 years of his career."
Hardy was born in 1925 in the English resort town of Cheltenham.
In 1959, on the stage of the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, he played with Lawrence Olivier in The Tragedy of Coriolanus.
Hardy was also remembered for repeatedly performing the roles of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, including in one of Agatha Christie's screenplays of Miss Marple.
For playing Churchill in the BBC drama Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years (1981), he was awarded the British Academy of Motion Picture and Television Arts (BAFTA) award.
Robert Hardy has also played the role of President of the United States, Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
Something rotted in the Danish state: Prince Henrik, and in fact Henri Marie Jean André, Count de Laborde, refused to be buried with his venerable wife, Queen Margrethe.
This year, the couple has a "golden" wedding, but on the agenda of the couple - not the preparation for the celebrations, but a deadly dispute.
His Highness renounced the title of Prince-Consort, at the same time he told the Queen that she never complained to him about the title of King-Consort.
Henry lives in France, although he remains the Queen's official husband.
Russian Foreign Ministry urges Washington to stop shelling Moscow
The Russian Foreign Ministry reacted to the statements of Mike Pence, who accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Balkans.
A corresponding statement was circulated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs some time ago.
In his commentary, the Foreign Ministry pointed out that the United States is increasingly using Cold War stamps that are inadequate to modern reality.
In addition, Russian diplomats called on the US authorities to stop shelling the Russian Federation.
As the “Arguments of the Week” wrote the day before, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Western Balkans and organizing a failed coup d’état in Montenegro.
Mikey Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko meet for the first time, there is a talk about the possibility of a decisive fight
Vasily Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who seem to be steadily moving towards holding the most exciting boxing match weighing up to 147 pounds in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in the office premises of the ESPN channel in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the undefeated lightweight champion of the World Boxing Council, walked down the corridor to greet Lomachenko, the champion of the World Boxing Organization in the second half.
After Garcia’s unanimous victory over the former world champion in four weight categories by Erien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both boxers are among the top five boxers regardless of weight categories.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, “How are you, champion?
Good luck to you.”
Lomachenko defends his belt in a fight with Miguel Marriaga on Saturday at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
When the boxers posed for the photo, manager of Lomachenko Egis Klimas noticed that the potential decisive fight between them would be at the very time.
“I used to be half-weight,” Garcia recalled.
“I went up in the category for Broner [up to <0xC2><0xA3>140], but I’m not that big.
I'm short for 140.
I want to get down to the semi-light.
And he needs to go up to the semi-light [up to 135 pounds], and then we'll have a fight.
That's what fans want.
Let's do it for them."
Lomachenko agreed.
“The boxing team needs this fight.
Klimas asked whether the fight should be broadcast through the service PPV, as part of the strategy he adheres to, that Lomachenko held his debut fight in weight 135 later this year, to appoint next summer meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who is also interested in fighting the victory.
“The fight may be on PPV because all the fans have asked for it,” Garcia said, later expressing readiness to fight on the channel that will offer the best financial conditions.
“We are the main names.
No other name will cause such an interest.
As soon as they are ready...”
Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a said he considers Lomachenko to be an “astonishing boxer” and may visit his Saturday match.
But Lomachenko did not immediately praise Garcia and said that, in his opinion, the three-way champion from Riverside looks “very slow, sorry, Mikey... you were trying to knock out”.
Garcia said he focused on showing the power of the punch, and then boxing.
They both said they felt the tension rising before their own fight.
“This fight has to take place.
No other fights cause so much interest and conversation.
I’m more than happy to work on it,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: “I was waiting for someone from the top boxers, and here he is, Mikey.
It will be a great fight.”
On several central streets of Moscow will shut down traffic for the weekend
This weekend, 5 and 6 August, traffic will be limited in the capital on the section of Tverskaya Street from Nastasinskaya Street to Triumphal Square, as well as traffic on 1st Tverskaya-Jamskaya Street.
In addition, the passage will be closed on Leningrad Avenue, from the Third Transport Ring to 1st Tverskaya-Jamskaya Street.
In all areas, the intersection will operate on both lanes, according to the information center of the Department of Transport of Moscow.
The streets will be closed from midnight on August 5 to 5 am on August 7 due to their improvement.
Also on the weekend, traffic will be closed on the Moskvoretska promenade.
There continues the construction of the park "Zaryadye".
Putin ordered the Prosecutor General's Office to check Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin has instructed the Prosecutor General’s Office of the Russian Federation to conduct a check on the territory of Baikal on the facts of illegal and environmentally harmful activities.
"I ask the Prosecutor General's Office to check the Baikal territory for the facts of illegal and environmentally harmful activities," Vladimir Putin said at a meeting on environmental development issues in the region.
In addition, the Russian leader asked to take action if the facts of the violations will be revealed.
New test results to assess the age of asylum seekers in Sweden have been published
Recent results from asylum-seekers in Sweden who were subjected to a new method of medical assessment of age show that more than 80 percent of those tested were evaluated as persons over 18 years of age, but not everyone trusts the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish National Agency for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) began testing earlier this year.
They were designed to make the assessment of age in the asylum process more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) criticized for failing to determine the actual age of some refugees who claimed to be minors.
So far, the Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases for testing, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,481 tests for the period between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) of those tested were assessed as people 18 years of age or older, and in another 25 cases, the forensic agency assessed that the tested “probably a person 18 years of age or older.”
In the case of 432 cases, the conclusion stated that the person "probably less than 18".
The tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person raises doubts.
According to Johan Geransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are in line with the results of the past months.
“We don’t see a big difference from the statistics over the past few months, the numbers are quite consistent,” he told The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which people were assessed as having reached the age of 18 does not necessarily indicate that asylum seekers lied about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases, "it is likely that the age of the tested person is 18 years or older."
However, after reviewing 581 published results, the newspaper "Svenska Dagbladet" found that in 243 cases the person openly stated that he is performing 18 this year.
The method of medical age assessment, which consists of x-raying wisdom teeth and tomography of the knee joints and giving them to dentists and radiologists for analysis, has also been criticized in some instances.
One of the skeptics is an endocrinologist from the Carolina Institute Claude Marcus, part of whose work is to assess the biological maturity of people in order to determine whether they have gone through puberty earlier or later than usual.
“I had reason to think about it, and I don’t think we should use the measurement methods that are being used now.
The biological age is thus determined very precisely.
If we can’t define it with confidence, we shouldn’t pretend that we can,” he told the Metro newspaper.
However, Geransen of the Forensic Medicine Agency said in favor of the accuracy of the tests: "In general, it can be said that the risk is wrong to take a child for an adult toddler.
We face the greatest risk when a person is soon 18, in which case it is about 10 percent.”
I wonder if I can run for president.
During a working trip to Buryatia, Vladimir Putin said that he was ready to consider whether he would run for president of Russia in the elections in 2018, Interfax reports.
This statement was a reaction to the request of the residents of the village of Cheremushka, Buryatia region.
During a video conference dedicated to the eradication of the fire in Buryatia and the Irkutsk region, the interlocutor addressed Putin with the words: "Vladimir Vladimirovich, we have a request to you: when the next presidential elections are held, we all ask you to run again for this post."
"Okay, I'll think about it, thank you," the president said in response.
On July 28, the press secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov commented on the statements of some media that the pre-election staff of Vladimir Putin will be headed by the head of the administration of the President of the Russian Federation Anton Weino.
Peskov called these assumptions “nothing grounded, hypothetical reasoning.”
"While there are no headquarters, before the establishment of headquarters is far, before the election campaign is far," Peskov said.
"This is not on the agenda yet," Peskov said.
The governor of West Virginia has said he is moving to another party.
The governor of West Virginia, a representative of the Democratic Party, Jim Justice, announced Thursday during a rally with President Trump that he is moving to another party.
“Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have distanced themselves from me,” Governor Justice said.
“Today I say to you with many prayers and many reflections ... today I say to you, the people of West Virginia: I can no longer be of use to you as a Democratic governor.”
The rally exploded with applause.
“That’s why tomorrow I will change my registration to a Republican,” Justice added.
“As a coach, I would tell you that it’s time to play differently.”
Earlier, Trump promised that an important statement would be made at a rally in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia by 42 percent, and Justice did not support Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states as he inherited the coal business from his father.
His fortune is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday night that “Governor Justice’s transition to another party is yet another blow to the Democratic Party, which is more of a hindrance than working to make our country great again.”
"Given only 15 governors and control over the smallest number of state legislatures in history, the statement of Governor Justice is just another rejection of the party, which has no leaders from the top to the bottom and is not able to find a positive, unifying message to the Republican Party," a spokeswoman for the party said in a statement to CBS News.
Cat-heavyweight named Mr. Krasavchik found a home thanks to social networks
A pet store in Pittsburgh, North Carolina, USA, has set up a cat named Mr. Beautiful, weighing more than 14 kilograms after it became famous thanks to the Internet.
This is reported by Mashable.
At the end of June, a photo of the cat was posted on Facebook asking to find his owner because “someone had obviously fed him before.”
In the comments, users noted that the expression of the animal's muzzle could become a new meme.
The publication received more than 3.2 thousand likes and 15,000 comments.
In the comments, dozens of people expressed a desire to shelter Mr. Krasavchik.
As a result, he was handed over to Angela Frazee, who promised to take care of his excess weight.
In an interview with WNCN radio, the American told that she had already had a similar experience: she took home a cat weighing about 10 kilograms, and now he weighs just over five.
In July, users of Reddit paid attention to a cat from Australia with unusually long paws.
The post with the photo of the animal collected more than 68 thousand views.
Commentators noted that she could quite possibly make a career in the modeling business.
Coe praised Russia’s “sincere” apology for the doping scandal
International athletics expert Sebastian Coe on Thursday praised what he called sincere apologies from Russia over the doping scandal, but reiterated that now is not the right time to allow the country to participate in sports competitions again.
The Russian representative of the athletics federation Dmitry Shlyachtin told the congress of the International Association of Athletic Federations, which was held on the eve of the World Championship in athletics, that the removal of his country from sports competitions was fair and that he was firmly in a good mood.
He apologised to “all athletes who had stolen gold and silver medals in the competitions.”
Despite his comments, the Congress of the International Association of Athletic Federations voted to maintain the suspension imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report on the found evidence of the use of state-funded doping.
“It seemed to me that today’s response, today’s report, was very sincere,” the president of the International Association of Athletic Federations Cow told reporters.
“The whole council and the whole congress liked ... that the Russian Federation itself admits that it had experienced extremely hot times and is now doing everything possible to take care of the restructuring of the federation.”
Coe said he also “liked” that Russia agreed to the criteria for its recovery.
“I think it was a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but Congress supports the recommendations of the special commission that now is not the time to restore Russia to rights,” he said.
“Over the next few months, we need to do everything we can to resolve this situation.
Our guiding principle was our desire to separate clean athletes from the stained system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes who meet the strict criteria of the International Association of Athletics Federations will take part under a neutral flag in the World Championships in Athletics, which will begin on Friday in London.
The head of the special commission of the International Association of Athletic Federations, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that a number of requirements for the restoration of Russia still have to be met.
He told reporters in London after a report made at the board of the International Association of Athletic Federations, drug testing is still not being conducted in sufficient volume, and suspended coaches are still calmly doing their job.
Court Arrests Ukrainian Journalist Suspected of Gossip
Detained by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) journalist Vasily Muravitsky is sent to arrest for two months, reports SBU.
An employee of the online publication Zhytomyr Journal is suspected of treason by posting his publications on Russian websites and invading the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
At the same time, Russia does not support the measures of the Ukrainian authorities against the journalist, considering it a "barbaric policy" against the media.
Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy decided on a limited military operation in the Mediterranean.
The patrol ship "Commander Borsini" entered the territorial waters of Libya, then together with the Navy of that country to stop the influx of illegal migrants.
The decision to start the operation was taken by the Italian parliament on Wednesday.
Rome agreed with the internationally recognized Libyan government, which, however, does not control much of the country's territory.
An opposition cabinet and Tobruk-based Libyan parliament has accused Italy of violating Libya's sovereignty.
And the commander of the Libyan National Army, Field Marshal Haftar, ordered his subordinates to counter the Italian ships.
In Rome, however, they said they do not believe in these threats and intend to send another warship to Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week at the talks between Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and the head of the European-recognized Libyan cabinet, Faiz Zaraj.
Italy has set up a naval mission to combat illegal migration after statistics on the number of illegal migrants arriving in the country from Libya were released in July: 95,000 people since the beginning of the year.
The government said the resources for the reception of migrants were exhausted.

For some time, users were unable to receive and send messages.
Two leaders of the national team of Ukraine on athletics suspended from participation in the World Cup
Olga Zemlyak and Olesya Povh, who specialize in short distance running, are excluded from the Ukrainian national team for the 2017 World Cup in London.
This is reported on the website of the Federation of Athletics of the country (FLAU).
This decision was taken by the executive committee of the organization in connection with the initiation of disciplinary proceedings against athletes by the International Association of Athletic Federations (IAAF).
Zemlyak coach Sergey Basenko has also been excluded from the Ukrainian delegation.
According to Sportarena, the IAAF suspects an athlete in the use of doping.

The World Athletics Championships will be held in London from August 4 to 13.
How Football’s Financial Rules Will Affect Neymar’s Move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unlimited spending on the part of European football clubs will not prevent the world record-setting transfer of Neymar from the Spanish "Barcelona" to the French "Paris Saint-Germain".
Whatever consequences may arise further along the chain, for the Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA, the governing body that controls European football, in whose power to prohibit teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League tournament.
From the financial fair play rules introduced by UEFA in 2011, it follows that PSG will eventually have to show that Neymar’s transfer was financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million ($262 million) just to free the Brazilian from the contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of Neymar’s move to France.
PSG can certainly afford to hire Neymar and add him to the galaxy of other stars, considering the team’s funding from the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs have the right to spend large sums to acquire players, but they have to balance them at the expense of legitimate sources of income to reach the profitability threshold in their football business.
The FFP was introduced by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The former French footballer believed that clubs in huge debt in their quest for success, in fact, cheated and risked destruction in the event that banks or owners stopped financing.
In 2011, the FFP stopped focusing on the debts of the clubs and instead switched to tracking their losses.
As a result, the change in the business model that Roman Abramovich initially used at Chelsea in 2003 – to buy a club with good potential, and then spend seriously in order to improve the team and create a global brand – became a difficult plan.
During the current three-year evaluation period, which is exciting for 2018, clubs could suffer losses of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million.
And despite the fact that Platini was shamefully removed from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Alexander Ceferin, is still determined to deter excessive spending.
“Of course, the FFP is alive and we will tighten the rules as we move forward,” Andrea Traverso, who controls the FFP at UEFA, told Associated Press last week.
Although PSG will pay the redemption of Neymar's contract at once, it can distribute this amount for the entire duration of his contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer value can be shown in the annual report as an expense of 44.4 million euros over the next five years.
During the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, the PSG, as well as the Manchester City, which belongs to Abu Dhabi, were subjected to severe sanctions.
PSG was fined <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 million (about $82 million at that rate), which was later reduced to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 million, and was ordered to limit its team in the Champions League during the 2014-1015 season to 21 players instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is tracking clubs that may try to outsmart its financial inspections by inflating its revenue at the expense of companies associated with the club's owners.
Although the Qatari company could have sponsored PSG, if the amount of funding were deemed to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not have allowed it to be considered a legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the amount of funding for PSG by the Qatar Tourism Authority was inflated.
It was reported that part of Neymar’s earnings in PSG could have come in the form of payments from the organisational committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar will become the ambassador of the World Cup, and such a maneuver could easily be detected by UEFA inspectors.
The past sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will be even more careful to monitor any attempts to circumvent the rules.
As reported on Thursday by people familiar with the situation, UEFA did not hold preliminary discussions with PSG about the transfer of Neymar.
They spoke with the Associated Press under conditions of anonymity, as they were not authorized to discuss the situation of PSG.
According to the latest published report, in 2015-1016, PSG received more than 10 million euros in profits with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The report for the last financial year has not yet been published.
PSG expects that Neymar’s arrival will be a favorable ground for sponsorship deals, sales of attributes and T-shirts with the team’s logo.
The club expects turnover to grow by at least 30 percent as a result of hiring a new player.
Undoubtedly angry that one of the best players is leaving, the Spanish league tried to prevent Neymar's transfer, saying that PSG would violate the financial fair play.
“This is an obvious case of ‘financial doping’, with the club and the state,” La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to Qatar as the final owner of PSG.
Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sports tycoon, shares La Liga’s doubts about the club’s funding by the state.
"These are all consequences of participation and have completely changed the landscape of football over the past fifteen years," Wenger said on Thursday.
“When the club belongs to the country, anything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to follow the financial fair play, because the country can have many ways and many reasons to be presented by such a serious player.
The order and place of the oath shall be determined by the President.
Where and how new Russian citizens will swear allegiance to the Russian Federation will be determined by the President - such amendments to the second reading of the relevant law have been developed by the State Duma Committee on Legislation and State Construction.
A week ago, MPs planned to directly determine the procedure for swearing in the law.
Children under the age of 18, as well as incapable, will be exempted from the solemn oath, it follows from the revised text of amendments to the draft law "On citizenship of the Russian Federation" (available at the disposal of "Izvestii"), which the committee will consider before the second reading at its meeting on July 11.
The idea of introducing an oath of citizenship of the Russian Federation instead of the formal signing of documents, President Vladimir Putin supported on June 6 during a meeting with the Speaker of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodymyr.
The deputies have drafted this idea in the form of an amendment to the second reading of the draft law, which provides for the annulment of the decision on the extradition of citizenship to those who were subsequently convicted of a number of crimes of a terrorist or extremist nature: for example, the Internet.
According to the bill, his logic was this: by issuing citizenship documents, a person signs a promise to comply with Russian legislation - he has taken the path of extremism, he violates this promise.
The bill was introduced in the State Duma in April by the leaders of the Duma factions Vladimir Vasilyev ("United Russia"), Gennady Zyuganov (KPRF), Vladimir Zhirinovsky (LDPR), Sergey Mironov ("Fair Russia") and the Speaker of the General Assembly Vyacheslav Volodin.
On May 19, the deputies adopted it at first reading.
Last week, the DG Committee on State Construction and Legislation approved the text of the bill at second reading, but now it has been revised again.
Now it says that the procedure for taking the oath will be established by the President of the Russian Federation.
Earlier, parliamentarians were going to describe the procedure directly in the law "On citizenship of the Russian Federation", specifying that the ceremony should be held in a solemn atmosphere in front of the state coat of arms and the flag of Russia in the presence of the representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
However, it was not clear from the text of the bill where such an event should take place - the list of places where it is possible to place the coat of arms of the Russian Federation is regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include courts, offices of heads of state bodies of subjects, municipal entities, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal executive bodies, etc.
Most likely, it could also be ZAGS.
A solemn oath will be taken by those wishing to obtain Russian citizenship after officials have checked their documents.
But the Russian passport a person will receive only after taking the oath, it follows from the revised text.
A week ago, the draft stated that the oath should precede the signing of the decree.
In the updated text, it is said that Russia will be sworn in from the age of 18, not from the age of 14.
The rule has been maintained that incapacitated or incapacitated persons, as well as those who cannot pronounce, read or sign the text of the oath by hand, will be exempted from taking the oath.
In addition, the President of the Russian Federation has the right to exempt from this procedure and "other persons",
Also, the updated bill prescribes a special procedure for admission to Russian citizens of residents of Ukraine, who are considered to be native speakers of the Russian language.
They will have to formally renounce Ukrainian citizenship by submitting a corresponding application to the authorized body of Ukraine.
A notarized copy of the application will need to be handed over to Russian officials.
The renunciation of "foreign" citizenship, as it is now, will not be necessary if it is provided for in an international treaty or if it is not possible "for reasons not dependent on the person".
The corresponding amendment to the law was proposed by a group of deputies, among them the first Deputy Speaker of DG Ivan Melnikov (KPRF), Natalia Poklonskaya, Pavel Krasheninnikov and Ayrat Farrahov (all - "United Russia").
I think many of you know that getting a certificate from Ukraine is unrealistic, simply impossible.
Accordingly, a lot of people are waiting for the decision of their fate on the citizenship of the Russian Federation, - explained the head of the Duma committee on state construction and legislation Pavel Krasheninnikov (ER).
In addition, the text clarified that restrictions on the occupation of certain positions for foreigners will not apply to those who have in writing refused “other” citizenship and handed over the former passport to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia, but “for reasons not dependent on it” it has not ceased to be considered a citizen of another country.
Now foreigners are forbidden to hold positions in the municipal service, to be accepted to work in facilities and organizations, whose activities are related to ensuring the security of Russia.
Also, a person with dual citizenship or a residence permit of another country may not become a member of the State Duma or a member of the Federation Council.
It is planned that the law should come into force from 1 September 2017, by which time the necessary by-laws must be prepared.
Nostalgia becomes a niche in "Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
The current iteration of the story is nostalgically reminiscent of the glorious days of the characters in the 80s; of the era of grunge in the 90s (about the time when the outstanding masters David Wayne and Michael Shawalter made the comedy sketches "The State" for MTV); and of course,
As a fact of culture, it is at the same time the elevation and embodiment of our era with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a franchise, it seems to be anachronism.
"The First Day of Camp" was surprisingly good, and not just because of the absurd humor (including the original story of the talking can of vegetables, voiced by H. John Benjamin).
The result doubles the main joke: middle-aged actors play sexually preoccupied children who have just reached adulthood; as a result, the impossibility of returning to the game becomes part of the joke.
“Ten years later,” where adults have played adults, has less deep emotional roots, and its parody is more unsystematic, and includes riffs from 1990s stalker films such as Hands Swinging the Cradle.
In one episode, the character gets an Apple Powerbook, four-wheeled roller skates, and "a bunch of other things from 1991."
Many of the plot lines are the same.
The Brave Coop (Shaolter), now a writer, has not yet reached reciprocity from Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has not yet broken up with his virginity.
And then there’s the insane and vicious conspiracy involving Ronald Reagan (also Shawalter), who is now incited by George W. Bush Sr. (a tried-and-tested parody performed by Michael Jan Blake).
As always, the best part of a franchise is a departure from it.
It is especially funny to see the forever young Rudd, who sings the song of Matt Dillon from "Lonely Ones", whose character, the former great man Andy now looks old.
To bring this franchise success could be accidental madness in the spirit of the recursive series "Seven Up", until it reaches what, in my opinion, would be its logical conclusion: "Hot American Summer: twenty years later", where in the last scene the whole company would go to the cinema.
"Comrade Detective" on the Amazon addresses a different type of nostalgia: Cold War memories from "Americans", "Explosive Blonde" or even "Blitz" with her images of the struggle of East and West.
This comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with director Reese Thomas depicts a television film: a Romanian police drama of the 1980s about two policemen in Bucharest fighting for the truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist path.
The main roles - the life of Gregor and the idealist Joseph - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Cornelia Ulich, and their dialogues were voiced in English by Chenning Tatum (he is also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But only an idea.
There are a few visual jokes (police spends time watching a game of chess as Americans might watch football).
The team of famous voices behind the scenes - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - makes it interesting to play in "Guess the Voice".
But "Comrade Detective" is so attached to the plausibility of a clumsy propaganda drama - there is even a killer in the mask of Ronald Reagan - that often looks like it.
Six long episodes are lengthy, and funny is not very and not often.
If it were shorter, Comrade Detective would be better able to handle his satire in the spirit of agitprop; for example, every time Gregor and Joseph come to the American embassy, two fat men sit in the lobby, devouring a bunch of hamburgers.
To the imaginary communist spectator, this image tells us that Western culture is capable of making a meatball from anything.
The fictional Romanian authors of the film are not so wrong: We do this even with our own recent history, and with them too.
The prize pool of the match for the Russian Super Cup for football between "Spartak" and "Lokomotiv" will amount to about 30 million rubles.
This was reported by the President of the Russian Football Premier League (RFPL) Sergey Pryadkin at a press conference.
According to the head of the RFPL, the winner will receive 70% of this amount, reports RT.
He also added that to date there are almost no tickets for the match.
The match "Spartacus" - "Locomotive" will take place on Friday, July 14, at 21:30.
As noted by TASS, "Spartak" is the current champion of the Russian Federation, and "Locomotive" is the owner of the country's Cup.
Two young ufimts cleaned the furniture shop for 200,000 rubles
The other day, a 37-year-old Uffizi, who owns a furniture company, approached the police.
The man claimed to have stolen expensive tools from the workshop, which caused serious damage to its production.
The extraction of thieves became tools with a total cost of almost 200,000 rubles: two welding machines, a perforator, a hydraulics, a winch.
The police began to search for the criminals and soon came upon the residents of the Blagoveshchensk district of Bashkortostan, friends of 23 and 24 years.
According to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic, accomplices penetrated the territory of the enterprise, broke in the front door and brought out the tools.
Immediately after that, the guys sold the stolen equipment to the first hit car service.
A theft case has already been initiated against them, and law enforcement officials have managed to return only part of the stolen instruments to the legal owner.
The State Department commented on the words of Medvedev on the relations of the Russian Federation and the United States
The United States and Russia must be able to work together.
This statement was made by the official representative of the State Department Heather Nauert in response to the words of the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev on the relationship between the two states.
Earlier, the head of the Russian government said that by adopting new anti-Russian sanctions, the United States put an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations and declared a full-fledged trade war with Russia.
Commenting on these words, Nauert acknowledged that Russian-American relations are at a “low level,” but noted that “areas for interaction” should be sought.
“Look at the ceasefire in southwestern Syria, which has been in place for almost a month.”
“This is an example of good cooperation between the United States and Russia,” the diplomat told RIA Novosti.
At the same time, the representative of the foreign policy department refused to comment on the statement of the Russian prime minister that the sanctions are equivalent to a trade war.
The bill on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK was signed by US President Donald Trump last Wednesday.
At the same time, he admitted that the document failed and contradicts the American Constitution.
Dior "grows" roses from amethysts and quartz
The jewellery division of the French fashion house Dior - Dior Joaillerie - complemented the collections of Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose.
There were five new rings and three choker rings on velvet ribbons.
The Rose Dior Pré Catelan line released two new rings and pendants made of amethysts, pink quartz and diamonds, made in the technique of gliptic (manual carving on stone) and respect and dedicated to the 70th anniversary of the house.
The head of the Dior Joaillerie, Victoire de Castellan, was inspired by the roses that Christian Dior, the designer of his estate in Granville, had grown, and by the Parisian gardens of Bagatelle and Pre-Catélan.
Trump has found the culprits of the deterioration of relations with Russia
U.S. President Donald Trump has sharply criticized members of Congress.
According to the American leader, their actions led to the deterioration of relations with Russia.
Our relations with Russia are at an unprecedentedly low and dangerous level.
“You can thank Congress, these same people can’t even give us medicine,” the president tweeted.
The day before, Donald Trump signed a law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK.
They will, in particular, affect Russian banks and energy companies.
Later, the White House issued a statement by the president, in which he indicated that the law would not allow the United States to make profitable deals and would bring Russia, China and North Korea even closer.
Belarusian entrepreneur refuses to buy Ukrainian daughter of Sberbank
Belarusian businessman Viktor Prokopenya has withdrawn from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) an application for the purchase of a subsidiary of Sberbank.
The businessman explained his decision to RBC with the intention of "concentrating on our other planned investments and projects that we are working on."
According to Mr. Prokopeni, such a step will be the "best investment of time", despite the investment attractiveness of the purchase of Sberbank's daughter.
Mr. Prokopenya became the main contender for the purchase of a Russian bank unit in Ukraine after the NBU rejected the application of NorvikBank consortium Grigory Guselnikov and the Belarusian company Said Guceriev in July.
Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after President Petro Poroshenko imposed sanctions on their subsidiaries in March.
One such financial organization - in addition to VTB and Vnesheconombank - became Sberbank.
Novak named the reason for the blackout in Crimea
In the Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation called the cause of blackout in the Crimea.
Explanations about what happened were made by the head of the department Alexander Novak.
According to him, the peninsula was left without electricity due to a traffic accident on the territory of the Krasnodar region.
The truck hit the power lines, as a result of which the Cuban and related Crimean networks were disconnected.
Failures in the power supply of major Crimean cities were recorded last week.
Experts corrected the problem within a few hours.
Initially, it was reported that the cause of blackout could have been an abnormal heat.
Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and weakening inflation have silenced rumors of a possible rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain sluggish and has left interest rates unchanged amid growing pressure on household incomes.
Experts from the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6 to 2 to maintain rates at 0.25%, with a smaller number of committee members this month in favour of rate hikes because weak economic growth weakened support for the hike.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank limited its forecasts to an increase of 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that pressure on family incomes will continue, while inflation is still expected to rise to about 3% in the fall.
However, the bank warned that rate hikes in the next few years would be necessary to control Brexit-induced inflation, and said that borrowing costs would likely have to rise more sharply than expected in financial markets.
Members of the committee also voted to abandon part of the huge package of economic development measures launched a year ago as a result of Brexit.
Starting next February, the bank will close the emergency financing plan, under which it provides banks with cheap loans, although he said he would now have to provide another <0xC2><0xA3>15 billion under the plan - up to <0xC2><0xA3>115 billion.
In a statement, the bank said: “According to MPC’s core forecasts, GDP growth will remain slow in the near future, while pressure on real household incomes continues to affect consumption.”
On the issue of rates, he reiterated that in order to halt inflation, it will require “some tightening of financial policy” to “slightly larger” than the markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all increases will be “gradual” and “limited”.
The bank’s forecasts for an increase this year and next year are lower than the forecasts made in May, which were equal to 1.9% and 1.7%.
The bank left its forecast unchanged at 1.8% in 2018.
After this news, the sterling fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to $1.31 and 0.4% to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.11.
The decision not to change the rate was made after the recent disappointing growth indicators weakened the expectation of an increase; GDP then grew by 0.3% in the second quarter against 0.2% in the previous three months.
According to a representative of the bank, growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will begin to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The bank’s latest report on inflation gave little cause for rejoicing to households, which were hit by high inflation and very slight wage increases: according to the bank, the pressure will intensify before declining.
The bank added that financial policy “cannot prevent” the earnings udao in the next few years, but expects that wages will “significantly” recover by the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also geared towards growth as a result of growing demand for British goods, due to the low pound exchange rate, which offsets some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision came a year after rates were cut to 0.25% last August after the shocking results of the referendum on leaving the European Union, which led to the pound falling.
The bank estimates that it will likely take four years to fully influence prices and the economy.
Before the bank made its last decision on rates, there was an increase in the noise around the expected rate hike, as inflation pushed households under increasing pressure: three of the experts on the committee asked to raise rates to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in July, although, according to the bank, this fall was expected and will be compensated again in the coming months.
According to the bank, the higher rate compared to the planned 2% is entirely a consequence of the low rate of the pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Mortgage Brokers Koreko, said: “If you take into account the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become even more competitive once again as lenders demand business opportunities and expect a good end to the year.
The market looks particularly favorable for those who are approaching the end of their existing contracts, as refinancing of loans, often with the possibility of no commission, as well as at a low rate, is becoming more popular than ever.
The State Health Service will prescribe the controversial drug for HIV 10,000 people
Starting in September, patients will have access to a “revolutionary” drug for HIV prevention after a battle in the High Court on the question of financing the drug from the funds of the State Health Service.
The National Health Service of England has announced that pre-exposure prevention of HIV (PrEP), a pill taken before sex, which has been proven to reduce the risk of infection in people at risk by an average of 86 percent, will now be provided by the health service for a period of 10 years.
She agreed to fund the trial after the appeals court backed a High Court ruling last year that the National Health Service had the option to pay for the PrEP despite her claims that it should be funded by local authorities.
The move, which was announced on Thursday, was dubbed the "most important innovation" by Simon Stevens, president of the National Health Service of England, and the National AIDS Control Authority (NAT) called it a "turning point".
Before the full launch of the program across England by April 2018, venerological dispensaries in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start registering people, and even more dispensaries will join the program in October.
Pre-exposure prevention (PrEP) is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Research has shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
When taking PrEP before sex in the human body, a sufficient number of certain drugs to prevent infection with HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken daily or no later than two hours before sex.
Patients entitled to receive the drug include homosexual and bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are HIV-positive and do not receive successful treatment.
The dispensaries will select suitable participants who have agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgender people, and individuals whose partners are not known to have their HIV status deterred by antiretroviral therapy.
People living and enrolled in a general practitioner in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in the nearest venerological dispensary participating in the program.
The program will cost <0xC2><0xA3>10 million, and the National Health Service of England this week after an international tender for purchases signed a contract for the provision of the drug.
The study is designed to assess all the potential of PrEP by collecting clinical data on who is the target audience of the drug, its digestibility and its large-scale use.
“This critical innovation should complement and reinforce the broad-based and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of success in the fight against one of the greatest health threats facing humanity.
Deborah Gold, president of the National AIDS Control Agency (NAT), said: “This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
The PREP, if properly targeted at people in need of help and at risk, provides an opportunity to change the situation with the HIV epidemic in England.
Starting in September, people at risk of HIV, thanks to this study conducted in England at the expense of the National Health Service, will have access to a new opening new tool, the use of which a person can control the lives of many without discussing it with a partner.
We warmly welcome this news.”
Ian Greene, president of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: “Now first of all, we need to make sure that the test is quickly rolled out across the country and that no one at risk for HIV is forgotten.
Now that we’re equipped with an experimental PrEP drug, we’re going to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV.”
Shadow People’s Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: “We very much welcome the start of the PrEP test, it is very late due to months of delays and delays on the part of the government.”
The data demonstrates how revolutionary this drug can become as part of our approach to preventing HIV and stopping the transmission of this deadly infection.
This test will bring us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the test be rolled out across the country as soon as possible to protect people at risk for HIV and to move us one step further towards stopping the spread of HIV in society.
World Congress of Tatars adopted a resolution on the support of the Treaty of Tatarstan and Russia
The Sixth Congress of the World Congress of Tatars (WCT) adopted a resolution in which it noted the importance of maintaining the office of President in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post is “a positively established form of organization of the supreme state power in the republic and expressing the national interests of the entire Tatar people”.
In addition, the Congress stressed in the resolution the importance of the treaty on the separation of powers between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, he “played a positive role in the ethno-cultural, socio-economic and socio-political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole.”
The treaty between Moscow and Kazan, which has been in force since July 24, 2007, was signed for 10 years.
On July 11, the deputies of the State Council of Tatarstan appealed to the President of Russia to extend the agreement and keep the title of the head of the region.
Currently, Tatarstan is the only entity in the federation that has a treaty with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one whose post is called "president".
In Russia, there are difficulties in obtaining international driving licenses
HIBDD units are experiencing a shortage of international driving licences (IDRs).
To get such rights, you have to wait a few weeks in line, which has become a real problem for vacationers who want to go abroad on holiday with their car or rent it there.
It is worth noting that the situation with international driving licenses remains contradictory.
The IPU was introduced to make it easier for the foreign police to understand what was written in the national certificate, as the information in it is explained in five languages.
The requirements for international law are enshrined in the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic of 1968, but in the countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention, Russian rights are recognized as such.
However, in fact, it all depends on the specific police or rental offices: some require the ICU, and some have enough national rights.
To insure themselves, drivers still receive international rights, but it should be borne in mind that in countries that have not ratified the convention (for example, the United States, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia) the authorities have the right not to recognize either national rights or the IMF.
Now there is a problem with forms in almost all units of the GIBDD, reports Kommersant, conducting a study in a number of regions.
So, in Moscow in the units of the UHHRIBDD, the cards are simply not issued, the forms have been missing for four months.
You can register for the reception on the website of state services, but there the line has already been extended until mid-August.
In Krasnoyarsk, it is impossible to obtain an ICU "for technical reasons", without going into details, in the Samara region it is honestly said that there are no forms, a similar situation is developing in other cities.
The problem has already been faced by many Muscovites, such messages are increasingly appearing on social networks:
Irina Burmistova: “Guess why you can’t get international rights in Moscow?”
That's right, because all the IBDD offices have completed the forms.
Elena Podkolzina: "A question to the people who know!"
International law needs to be dealt with urgently.
In Moscow all the time is stuck far ahead, on the spot the vouchers are not issued at all (there is a button, but the voucher can not be given).
As if the portal of state services shows that in the SPB free time to fig.
Did anyone try to get in another city?
Will it work?
As explained in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, the requirements for forms of international driving licenses have changed, so new forms are being delivered to the Department of State Inspection.
This may be the result of a deficit, but it is not clear what changes are being made, and this has not been previously reported.
Forms are purchased by the Center for Special Purposes in the Field of Road Safety (CSN BDD) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation and then delivered to the units of the GIBDD.
In recent years, all contracts were concluded with JSC "Goznak": in 2014-2015 almost 200,000 blanks of the Ministry of Internal Affairs were manufactured, in 2016 15,000 blanks were purchased, in 2017 - 90,000, but the last contract was concluded on July 18 with JSC "First Printed Yard".
There is a version that CSN simply did not manage to hold a tender in time, which is why there was a deficit.
However, there are other versions of the lack of forms: due to the crisis, many people began to travel independently not to Europe, but to cheaper Asian countries - China, Thailand and so on.
What rights are accepted there, it is not clear to the end, so people are reinsured, and therefore there was a stirring demand for international "shortcuts".
Recently it became known that professional drivers will have to pass an exam to confirm their qualifications.
This was the proposal made by the Ministry of Transport.
The International Driving Permit (IVR) of the new model has been in force since 31 May 2011.
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean bridge
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine Pavel Petrenko said that he does not believe in the ability of Russia to build a bridge in the Crimea.
He said this on Friday, August 4, in an interview with the Observer portal.
No self-respecting international company will even put a bolt or nut there, because it risks losing its business in the EU, the US, Japan – in countries that have joined sanctions against Russia against Crimea.
"That is, in my deep belief, the prospects for this project are virtually non-existent," Petrenko said.
He added that he believes Russia is incapable of implementing a major infrastructure project on its own.
Russia cannot normally build smaller-scale facilities.
I know that after the Olympics in Sochi, entire stadiums have already begun to collapse.
“Therefore, I think the best tool in this situation is sanctions against companies that have been so short-sighted to join this project,” the official said.
On July 31, the builders completed the construction of the vault of the car arch of the Crimean Bridge.
On the coast of Kerch, an extensive assembly of the Crimean Bridge road arch has been completed: its arch will be closed at an altitude of 45 meters from the base of the structure.
"At the same time, the bridge builders have prepared a railway arch for installation on the rafters", - said in the information center of the project.
In April, the head of the Ministry of Transport Maxim Sokolov informed the President of Russia Vladimir Putin that the construction of the facility is going ahead of schedule.
The Crimean bridge will connect the Crimean peninsula and the Krasnodar region.
In Spain fired an official who did not go to work for 10 years
What kind of angelic patience (or absolute indifference to public service) should the chief of the Spanish official, Carlos Resio, have had?
The permanent walk stretched for 10 long years.
However, Mr. Resio was still dismissed.
But not his direct boss.
Which only in the world of bureaucrats does not happen.
The inhabitants seem to have long been accustomed to all the gossip of "servants of the people".
And yet, officials always manage to surprise those on whose taxes they live well.
This time the "sensation" complained from Spain.
There, the Valencian archives employee Carles Resio managed for ten years not to go to work.
At the same time, he regularly received a salary.
And the whole solid - 50,000 euros per year.
And now Mr. Resio's "wonderful times" are over.
He was sacked by a decision of the Valencian legislature.
The investigation revealed that a vicious walker came to the office every working morning at 07:00 to be noted in the electronic system.
And then I went home.
Once again he appeared at the workplace at 16:00 to remark in the system that he left.
It's been 10 years.
It also became known that all his free time the walker devoted to drawing comics at home.
Now the deputies of the legislative assembly of Valencia are thinking about how to punish the direct boss of Mr. Resio, who could not help but know how to "actively work" in his workplace his subordinate.
Judges are asked to protect themselves from the presidents.
The Presidential Human Rights Council (HRC) on behalf of Vladimir Putin has developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judicial branch of power.
The HRC proposes to limit the powers of the presidents of the courts and introduce their elective powers.
For the courts of appeal and cassation bodies, the HRC wants to introduce special districts that will not be tied to the administrative and territorial division in the Russian Federation.
His proposals within the framework of the presidential commission should also be presented by the Supreme Court.
The HRC has completed the development of proposals that will strengthen the independence of Russian justice.
This work was carried out by the HRC on behalf of Vladimir Putin on January 3, 2017, which the President gave after meeting with members of the Council.
At the meeting with the members of the Council on 8 December 2016, individual cases of judicial arbitrariness, as well as problems of public control in the places of detention of citizens were discussed (see "E" of 9 December).
The results of the work of the HRC were 25 proposals, which deal with issues of ensuring the independence of judges and the identification of judicial errors, as well as the financing of courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of the Kremlin human rights defenders is to limit the powers of the presidents of the courts to increase the independence of other judges.
If the candidate for the position of judge has successfully passed the competition and has received the support of the judiciary, then the President of the Court, in the opinion of the HRH, must present him for appointment, without having the right to refuse, as the law now allows.
It is also proposed to deprive the President of the right to distribute cases to the judges.
To do this, experts allow, can specially written computer program.
Also, the HRC believes that the chairman is not entitled "to determine the results of the qualification certificate of the judge, to initiate his involvement in disciplinary responsibility, to make decisions on the establishment of additional material payments".
At the same time, the Presidential Council considers it necessary to go to the "election of the chairmen of the courts by the judges themselves" and "give them powers for a relatively short period with mandatory rotation".
Now all the presidents of the courts (from the republican to the district) are appointed for six years by the president on the proposal of the president of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
In order to protect judges from pressure from regional administrations, the HRH proposes to reorganize appeal and cassation in the courts of general jurisdiction.
Now their structure is tied to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
It is necessary to ensure the organization of individual courts of appeal and cassation bodies not at the level of regional judicial bodies in the subjects of the Russian Federation, but in judicial districts.
Experts are based on the practice of arbitral tribunals.
There are “judicial districts” that do not coincide with the administrative division in the Russian Federation, but guarantee greater independence from regional officials who find it difficult to use the “phone law”.
World Judges HRC proposes to strengthen the people's deputies to consider with their participation some "categories of civil and administrative cases".
For example, the deprivation of parental rights, the restoration of work, the protection of honor and dignity, the deprivation of driving rights, etc.
"These are just our proposals," explained the member of the Constitutional Court, the judge of the Constitutional Court in the resignation of Tamara Morshchakov.
She also recalled that the President’s injunction was not only for the HRC, but also for the Supreme Court, which had not yet disclosed its proposals.
The time for carrying out the assignment to the Armed Forces (among the co-executors - the Prosecutor General's Office and the Commissioner for Human Rights in the Russian Federation) still exists.
To report to Vladimir Putin about how effectively the independence of justice is ensured in Russia, the President of the Armed Forces Vyacheslav Lebedev should before September 1.
Living a High Life: Half-Floor and Clever Design Tricks Turned This Small Earls Court Apartment Into A Spacious Home
Joan Lee, a former banker with a passion for real estate repairs, moved from a spacious house in Knightsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of a nice typical house in the style of Queen Anne, and in favor of the new design says that Joan did not collect her belongings and did not move again.
“I used to live with my ex in Knightsbridge on a much larger square,” Joan says.
“I was looking for something comparable for my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and offered a price the same day.”
From the moment of first viewing, the apartment with an area of 1000 square feet has undergone a complete reconstruction.
Initially, it was a one-bedroom apartment with a complex layout – to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen – and Joanna wanted to add storage space and a half-story to squeeze the maximum benefit from the generous ceiling height.
“I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
Those were my demands,” she says.
To this end, she hired Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill’s Duck & Shed architectural and design studio to use 12.5-foot-high ceilings to create a home that would not only be a successful project, but would be useful to Joan for life.
The ceiling was not high enough to arrange two rooms one above the other, so the architectural task was to create a half-story where one could stand at full height.
Erfan had to think creatively to deal with the brief.
“Working with steel structures is very difficult,” he explains.
“We had to arrange the rooms so that they were one above the other and did not have to bend.
It was not only necessary to build a simple platform, but also to bend the structures so that they were at the right height and allow the use of the premises above and below.
This decision allowed Erfan to arrange two full-sized rooms one above the other in the allocated space – and much more interesting.
From the half-floor through the vintage copper light window from «Retrouvius» opens the view to the chic living room below.
Mirror furniture with a gold finish, silver accents and vintage luminaires from Serge Muy set the style of the project.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding spectacle, space and light.
The short corridor is framed with mirrors to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirrored protective panel looks like a window to another room.
At the entrance, the mirror cabinets are used to store all Joan's utensils.
To create the feeling of a more luxurious space, the beauty of the living room can fence itself the kitchen when it is not used.
There is nothing new in the folding kitchens.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it is a sliding up door, as in a garage.
“Here the engineering was involved,” Erfan tells about the steel-reinforced wood-fibre shield door.
“It’s equipped with a counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slides very easily.”
Thanks to the reasonable use of space and storage space, Joan has received an additional 16 square meters, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
“In the end, the floor area is exactly what you’re going to sell, that is, what your property is valued at,” Erfan says.
“Roughly speaking, a real estate agent will come in and make calculations based on the area of the sexes.”
Here they were able to increase the floor area, using quality materials that give the space a touch of luxury.
“Materials are what we touch, so they help create an emotional connection with the home,” Erfan says.
“Nobody falls in love with wiring in the walls.
It’s important, but it doesn’t touch the strings of our hearts.”
This is a testament to the fact that, thanks to the good design and the increased meters, the apartment can turn from something ordinary into something amazing.
In fact, like Joan, you can decide to stay.
Government Approves Establishment of Cultural Policy Commission
The Russian government has approved the creation of a commission on state cultural policy.
The relevant resolution was published on the Government's website.
According to the document, the main task of the commission will be to develop and adjust strategic approaches to the implementation of cultural policy.
The Commission will also develop draft cultural policy strategies, clarify the objectives and prepare new programmes for their implementation.
The Head of the Commission has been appointed Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation.
The composition of the Commission will be approved separately.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev in 2016 approved a plan for the implementation of the strategy of state cultural policy until 2030.
The plan includes 193 activities and provides for measures to expand the influence of Russian culture in other countries, the preservation of a single cultural space and cultural heritage, and will also contribute to the creation of conditions for the development of culture in the country.
Inflation in the G20 countries has fallen to an eight-year low
Consumer price growth in the G20 countries has fallen to its lowest level in the last eight years, according to The Wall Street Journal, citing data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
According to OECD estimates, inflation rates in June 2016 amounted to 2% – lower values were noted in October 2009, when the price growth index reached 1.7%.
Earlier, Rosstat reported a decrease in the consumer price index in Russia by 0.1%.
Thus, the agency recorded the first weekly deflation in 2017.
The inflation target in Russia, according to the calculations of the Ministry of Finance, is 4.1%.
The Ministry of Economy, however, believes that the target has already been reached - according to this agency, the figure is 4%.
Putin warns against illegal slashing of Baikal taiga
The Russian leader Vladimir Putin warned during the meeting on the ecological development of the natural Baikal territory against the illegal destruction of forests.
During the event, Minister of Natural Resources Sergey Donskoy noted that a bill had been prepared earlier.
It permits deforestation during firefighting, and the government plans to adopt it as early as autumn.
In turn, the president said that this project should be monitored so that in the process of excision "not cut everything in a row".
Donskoy noted that this bill involves the control of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the supervisory authorities.
Media: the fighters of the Armed Forces secretly from the command negotiate with the militias of Donbas
On the line of armed confrontation in the Donbass established regular telephone communication.
The fighters of the opposing parties constantly communicate with each other on mobile phones, and they do not know about this communication in the headquarters.
The fighters of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the militias of the Donbass established communication on cell phones secretly from their high command.
This is reported on August 4 by Strana.ua with reference to the participants of the military operation in the Donbas.
According to the publication, the commanders of the units know perfectly the names of their colleagues on the opposite side of the front and communicate with them on the phone every day.
Communication is not at all commonplace: the commanders are trying to reach some "tactical agreements".
Often, the result of such talks is a truce on a certain part of the front.
Journalists became aware of cases when a birthday greeting was received by an officer because of the front line, from his formal enemy.
The fighters of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the militias of the DPR and LPR have been sitting in trenches on the demarcation line since the spring of 2014, when Ukraine began a combat operation against Donbass.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs outraged the blocking of statements of the UN Security Council on attacks on the Russian Embassy
The Russian foreign ministry is outraged by the actions of some Western diplomatic representatives, who block statements by the UN Security Council in the press condemning the terrorist shelling of the Russian embassy in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
The ministry recalled that the territory of the Russian Embassy in Damascus on August 2, the third time in a month was subjected to mortar shelling by terrorist groups "Heyat Tahrir Ash-Sham" (formerly "Jabhat al-Nusra", banned in the Russian Federation) and "Filak al-Rahman".
Taking into account that the international community unanimously in the classification of "Nusra" as a terrorist organization, and UN Security Council resolutions call to oppose this structure, in the Foreign Ministry of the Russian Federation noted that "it would seem, of course, that the counter-attacks of "Nusra" should meet the general unconditional and decisive axis
However, as emphasized in the diplomacy, "for the third time in a month, the diplomatic representatives of the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Ukraine in the UN Security Council have blocked the offer of the Russian Federation, alternately, varying the tonality of objections, taking into account the arguments of the Council on the alleged lack of necessary information,
The unwillingness to show diplomatic solidarity with us should remain on the conscience of these delegations.
"The most outrageous thing is that the inability of the Security Council to condemn the acts of terrorists encourages them to new provocations and terrorist attacks, gives them a sense of impunity," the Foreign Ministry said, adding that "the Council would not like these barbarians to be convinced that the barbarians have a conviction that
Vladimir Putin advocated limiting the number of unplanned business checks
Russian President Vladimir Putin said during a meeting on investment projects in the Far East that the number of unplanned inspections of entrepreneurs should be reduced to 30% of the number of planned ones, and also said the need to limit the duration of inspections to ten days.
“Unplanned checks are carried out, as a rule, without the appropriate agreement with the prosecutor’s office; only 2-3% agree with the prosecutor’s office, everything else goes on its own,” the president quotes TASS.
Vladimir Putin also said that investigators should be banned from removing servers and hard drives at enterprises.
In addition, according to the president, business associations should be given the right to defend the interests of their members in court.
"I hope this will bring a certain positive to the consideration of cases related to entrepreneurial activity or related to violation of the law in the field of entrepreneurship," the head of state said.
As reported by «<0xD0><0x95>», due to the effect of a moratorium on the conduct of scheduled inspections, the number of other types of inspections of entrepreneurs is increasing.
In May, according to the order of the business ombudsman under the President of Russia, Boris Titov, a survey was conducted by 195% (10%), as a result of which it was found that in fact there was a substitution of planned checks by unplanned ones (the share of those who faced them increased from 21.9% in 2015 to 30.8% in 2016), by prosecutorial (from 16.9% to 21,8%)

The brothers are fighting for a real estate empire worth more than $500 million
The two brothers are fighting for one of Victoria’s largest empires in real estate valued at more than $500 million — forty years after their Italian ancestors founded the dynasty.
Former Carlton football club director and builder Colin de Lutis lives in the Turak Palace through three doors from his younger brother Paul, who has filed a lawsuit against him in the Supreme Court over the division of possessions and assets.
Paul wants to leave the family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court is still in a fierce dispute over the terms of the divorce.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 87 objects worth more than half a billion dollars, bought since their family bought a store on Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There the family founded the company "Westco Jeans", which grew into a network of 160 outlets.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
The money was invested in the property, and the De Lutis family’s list of properties today includes office buildings, construction sites in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and in Mount Buller, and shopping malls in the suburbs.
Colin, whom Paul describes as the "major driving force and dominant personality" of the De Lutis family, owns about two-thirds of the company's assets, while Paul owns about one-third.
According to the court, this means that Colin's property is 316 million and Paul's is 176 million.
The division of property and money became a stumbling block for Paul.
“The section proposed by Colin gives him, in my opinion, the best parts of the property,” he wrote in his first testimony in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts at reconciliation, the first hearings in the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers now argue over who will control the existing business - from which, according to Paul, Colin excluded it.
Colin argues that this is not the case, but accuses Paul of incompetent management of some facilities.
In the testimony given by Colin at the start of the trial, he says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
“My Italian roots make me consider the family a top priority,” he wrote.
Costs are rising like a snowball: hundreds of pages of testimonies, emails and reports from companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer are included in the case; both sides have attracted the most famous lawyers, including royal attorney Allan Mayers, and
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were immigrants from Italy; from the late 1950s they ran milk bars and gastronomics, and in the early 1970s bought a store in Brunswick.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a store in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco when he was "in the last grades of school, and Paul was then a boy (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to hand over their possessions to their sons without conflict.
“Luigi has often told me that he doesn’t want the brothers to get to know each other in court,” she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies; Colina says Mark received $10 million when he left the business and Luke received $26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were “dissatisfied with the financial conditions of their branch.”
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the AFL club's board of directors and, according to the 2015 biography of Eddie McGir, the TV star's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin replied, with a text message saying that since the case had not yet been heard in court, "I really have nothing to say."
“I am very, very, very sorry that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and shake the name of our family in court,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in testimony that he was trying to satisfy his brother’s demands.
“Our father wouldn’t want to see Paul and I argue in court,” he said, adding that he “still hopes for a resolution of the conflict.”
On Friday, that hope was shattered.
“The decision on our case will soon be taken by the court,” Colin wrote.
The new head of Trump’s apparatus plans to limit the flow of information to the president.
Others tried to do so and were defeated.
Maybe John F. Kelly will be able to do that.
In that case, he will be the first.
"Politico" reports that the new head of the White House apparatus plans to limit the flow of information coming to President Trump, including news reports from the media, hoping to keep the boss in a calmer state.
That's what reporter Josh Dawsey said.
“At a meeting held by the new White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, with the leadership of the White House on his first working day, he outlined the main problem in the White House under President Donald Trump, which he hopes to solve: poor channels of information to the president.”
Kelly told employees that the information should go through him — in paper form or through briefings — because the president would be better off making decisions if he got the right information.
Kelly’s diagnosis is completely true, but others have already failed to appease Trump by tracking the information coming to him.
President Trump’s relationship with television began a few decades ago – and now that he’s in the White House, his habit of watching TV is still strong.
“When Trump, as a candidate, was outraged by the unfair coverage of the campaign, it was useful to show him that he was getting fair coverage in publications that could be persuaded,” Sam Nanberg, a former adviser to the electoral staff, told Politico in February.
Tara Palmeri then wrote in Politico that “according to six former members of the electoral staff, in order to keep under control Trump’s habit of writing on Twitter, it was necessary to ensure that there was a constant flow of praise in the information that came to him personally.”
Oh, good.
But the idea that Trump’s habit of tweeting was ever “under control” is just ridiculous.
Maybe these election staff members know something we don’t know — for example, that if they weren’t, Trump’s tweets would be even more provocative.
We may never find out about tweets that Trump didn’t post.
If his staff saved him from trouble at least several times, their efforts were not in vain.
But no one has always managed to keep Trump from pouring oil into the fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to advance their agenda by providing Trump with material — reliable or not — that confirms their views.
"Politico" - just to this story - wrote in May about the tendency of advisers to constantly incite the president to questionable information.
Here is an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“Current and former Trump officials say Trump can react very harshly to negative press reports, especially those containing dangerous information leaks, and won’t calm down until he finds out who was behind them.
This was the case at the end of February, when someone pushed the president to print an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles K. Johnson, in which deputy head of the apparatus Kathy Welsh was accused of "standing behind a number of leaks" in the White House.
It doesn’t matter that Johnson is forever banned on Twitter for aggressive behavior, that he didn’t present concrete facts, or that in the past he launched false accusations and then renounced them.
Trump read the article and began to question employees about Wales.
Goldmacher adds that the then head of the apparatus, Raines Pribus, and the secretary of the apparatus, Rob Porter, “attempted to build a system to manage the flow of papers that Trump receives and document them.”
How did it work?
Three months later, Kelly tries to do the same.
He may prove to be a more effective manager than Pribus, but Trump still has an impulsive nature, and his aides are still fighting each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly's task very difficult.
Tyumen prosecutor's office fights HIV-dissident
The prosecutor's office challenged the ruling of the Kalinin District Court of Tyumen, which terminated the criminal case against a local resident who had a minor daughter who died from HIV.
According to the investigation, the child died due to the fact that the mother is an HIV dissident and refused treatment.
However, the court relieved her of her responsibility for reconciling with the victim's father.
The prosecution believes that the crime should not be left unpunished in order not to set a precedent for other HIV dissidents.
The case against the resident of Tyumen was initiated pursuant to Article 109 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (cause of death by negligence) in April - after her three-year-old daughter died of stage 4B HIV infection.
According to the prosecutor's office, the mother herself is HIV-infected.
"The woman did not treat herself and refused to treat her daughter, believing that HIV infection does not exist," the prosecutor's office of the Tyumen region explained.
The criminal case came to the Kalinin district court of Tyumen, which on July 25 decided to terminate it.
The application was filed by the father of the deceased girl, explaining that "forgived his wife, has no claims to her, she smoothed the damage and made an apology."
The Prosecutor ' s Office disagreed with the court ' s decision and appealed, demanding that the order to terminate the case be annulled and sent for re-examination.
The girl died, and it is impossible to repair the damage caused by the crime.
The HIV-infected mother, contrary to the recommendations of doctors, refused to examine the baby and treat it for a dangerous infection," the prosecutor's office said in a statement.
According to the supervisory authority, she should be punished, otherwise her example will be followed by other HIV dissidents.
As told in the Tyumen AIDS Center, now in the Tyumen region about 12 children with HIV do not receive medical care due to the refusal of their parents.
"And this situation has already improved - during the year of work of the special group, half of the parents who categorically refused to treat children from HIV, changed their opinion - allowed to conduct a diagnosis, began to take drugs," - said the spokeswoman of the AIDS Center Elena Loseva.
According to her, it is impossible to influence parents in a legislative way, and as a result, not all HIV-infected children can be detected - mothers do not allow them to be examined, hide, run away with children from hospitals.
What are the dangers of HIV dissidents?
At the end of last year, St. Petersburg sociologists presented the results of the first study in Russia of the so-called movement of HIV-dissidents.
HIV dissidents are people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take medication.
Doctors and activists of AIDS-service NGOs call such views anti-medical, and in their spread see a serious threat.
The horrific photo shoot, which ended in tragedy, took place on Thursday, August 3, at the Grechany railway station in Khmelnytsky.
A cheerful company of drunk young people was walking on the bridge over the railways, where there was just a freight train.
One of the friends had the idea to make a spectacular selfie on the roof of the car, FACTAM reported in the police communication sector in the Khmelnytskyi region.
The guy began to get off the bridge to the train, but due to his carelessness he got stuck behind the power line and immediately received a shock current.
Fortunately, this case became known to the station's dispatcher, who immediately called an "emergency".
Before the arrival of the victim doctors were moved to a safe place, and then hospitalized in the burn department of Khmelnytsky regional clinical hospital.
The man was diagnosed with a 1<0xE2><0x88><0x92>2 degree burn.
His condition is now assessed by doctors as stable.
Law enforcement officials remind that in recent times, extreme selfies on the roofs of multi-storey buildings, bridges, moving transport have become increasingly popular.
The police are urging people to be vigilant and not to allow such photo shoots, especially among children and adolescents.
Scientists have allowed the existence of oceans on ancient Venus
There could have been oceans on ancient Venus.
This is the assumption made by French scientists.
Experts have created a computer model that demonstrated the process of water formation on the surface of the planets, writes Science News.
It turned out that on Venus at the beginning of its history formed oceans, in which there was 10% more water than now on Earth.
Previously, “The Arguments of the Week” wrote that, according to the hypothesis of scientists, the ocean could have existed on Mars 4 billion years ago.
Foreign experts in the course of their research came to the conclusion that the water object was located on the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.

Louna will release a new album in Barnaul
Louna’s concert will take place in Barnaul on October 17.
The musicians will present their new album "Wonderful New World", which became one of the most anticipated releases of the year.
The group is preparing a concept show that will be the brightest in the band’s concert history.
"Wonderful New World" is the fourth album by Russian rock band Louna.
Its name is associated with the famous novel-antiutopia O. Huxley "On the Wonderful New World".
The new songs do not retell the book, but tell of a society that lives by the law of anti-utopia, “a blind faith in propaganda and imposed values.”
To raise money for the recording of the album the group was helped by listeners: on the site "Planeta.ru" the project was supported by more than 1200 people.
Louna released her first album "Make It Louder!" in 2010.
Two years later, the musicians presented the album "Time X", and in 2013 they recorded the album "We are Louna" (2013).
In the fall of 2015, Louna performed with the symphony orchestra at Crocus City Hall with the program Songs of Peace.
As part of the group Lusine Gevorkyan (vocals), Vitaly Demidenko (bass guitar), Ruben Kazaryan (guitar), Sergey Ponkratiev (guitar), Leonid Kinzbursky (drums).
The concert will take place at the Barnaul club "Pharaoh" on October 17 at 19.00.
Ticket price: from 1200 to 2600 rubles.
Louna is one of the popular bands on the Russian rock scene.
The group was founded in 2008.
Their debut concert took place in 2009.
The group won several times in different nominations of the hit parade "Damn Dozen".
The gypsies overcame the trench and returned to the "street of millionaires"
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands once again clash with resolute gypsies who have overcome the moats dug by the municipal authorities to reoccupy the field near their homes.
The gypsies parked 20 houses on wheels in a field bordering the rich Solihalla Street, which was jokingly called “the street of millionaires”.
Bringing with them horses, infants and many houses on wheels, they returned after being driven no further than in May, and they were not hindered by the trench dug by the municipal authorities to prevent their invasion.
This tactical company found a rift in defensive structures and pushed its vehicles through an area that was left unfenced to leave room for the trail.
Angry residents attacked the municipality of Solichall, saying that he was "unable to solve this problem".
An anonymous local resident said: “They came here on Monday night after they were kicked out of Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at the passers-by.”
The municipality should be ashamed and forced to act, because they are completely incapable of solving this problem.
The gypsies were here in May, they were expelled, and here they are again.
Last night there were more Gypsies, and today there may be more.
“The City of Birmingham knows how to solve this problem, they get long-term court orders to protect their parks,” she added.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and I don’t like that I continue to pay the municipal tax, and the municipality can’t even put an end to it.”
One local resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: “It’s funny, we just saw these gypsies leave the previous time, and here, please, this attack continues.”
This time there were more of them, and we even saw a horse grazing on the meadow.”
A spokesman for the municipality of Solihull said: “We know of an illegal camp on the ground near Streetsbrook Road and are cooperating with the Solihull Police; we are taking the necessary legal action to expel them as soon as possible.”
To help us collect evidence, it is very important that as many locals as possible report any anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by phone 101.
This makes it possible to form an idea of the situation that the court will consider when we present our case to them.
Crimea shares the champagne wine factory "Novy Svet"
GUP of the Republic of Crimea "The Champagne Wine Plant "New World"" is decided to act, having transformed into JSC "The Champagne Wine Plant "New World"", follows from the order of the Minister of Property and Land Relations of Crimea Anna Anyukhina.
100% of the shares of the company will remain in the state-owned Crimea.
The authorized capital of the joint stock company will amount to 595.5 million rubles and will consist of 5.955 million ordinary shares with a nominal value of 100 rubles each.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Crimea said that if within the next three years there are no funds to modernize the plant, then there will be a threat of stopping the plant.
The output of fixed assets at the enterprise is about 60-70%.
The modernization of the enterprise requires 1.2 billion rubles. Due to the peculiarities of the organizational and legal form, it is obliged to give 50% of the profit to the income of the budget.
What remains is not enough to implement the modernization plan.
"To get money from the owner is problematic, to talk about attracting loan funds of large credit organizations is difficult," said Deputy Head of the Crimean Ministry of Economy Sergey Petelin in April of this year.
The Crimean Parliament included the enterprise in the forecast privatization plan for 2017.
It was proposed to carry out its promotion and to put it up for auction.
The Interfax source in the Crimean authorities estimated the possible cost of the sale of the enterprise at $40 million, the investor's investment in modernization - another $30 million.
“New World” in 2016 increased the production of sparkling wines by 2.8% compared to the level of 2015 – up to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, “New Light” intended to release 1.6 million bottles.
The company was founded in 1878 by Prince Lvov Golitsyn as a factory for the production of sparkling wine in the estate New World purchased by him.
The plant is located on 11 hectares of land.
Nizhny Novgorod third-grade students have destroyed more than 40 tombstones
Employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Nizhny Novgorod region have identified the identities of citizens who destroyed 46 tombstones in the cemetery of the city of Lyskovo.
The attackers were third-grade students.
The first statement that the gravestones were damaged by unknown ones came to the Russian Armed Forces in Lyskovsky district on June 27.
A total of 24 people contacted the police in this regard.
As a result, a criminal case was initiated under Article 244 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation "Destruction, damage or desecration of burial sites".
According to the results of the investigation, the police identified the suspects, they turned out to be two schoolchildren aged 8 and 9.
The juvenile offenders told the police that they were interested in watching the monuments fall, and this prompted them to engage in hooligan activities.
Preventive measures have been taken with children and their parents.
Italy is tightening its tone against NGO ships that rescue migrants.
Italy has warned NGOs who own rescue vessels in the Mediterranean that they will not be able to continue working unless they comply with the new rules governing their activities.
"If NGOs do not comply with the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say whether they will be able to continue their activities," Interior Minister Mario Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily Stampa.
The warning came the next day after Italian authorities seized a ship belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Rettet on suspicion that its crew was actually cooperating with human traffickers and facilitating illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which has worked for only a year, declined to comment on the substance of the detailed charges brought against it by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human life is and will remain a top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot continue our activities in the search and rescue zone right now," the organization said in a statement on social media.
“We will only be able to assess all the allegations made now, once we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation.”
Italian authorities have been monitoring the Juventa vessel, owned by Jugend Rettet, since October.
His crew is suspected of taking migrants on board with whole lifeboats, which human traffickers sent directly to them, and allowing smugglers to leave with boats that they could reuse.
At least one such meeting is believed to have taken place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the indictment, the content of which was published in Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the regulations of the Italian coastal authorities, which control rescue operations in the area, rather out of humanitarian zeal than for any other reason.
The Code of Conduct mainly envisages that Juventus-type vessels will have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
So far, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to abide by the code: “Save the Children”, the Maltese MOAS and “Pro-Activa Expanded Embrace” from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that it considers the new rules unnecessary but acceptable provided they do not involve any "significant changes or interference" in its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said the sharp decline in recent weeks in the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue operations indicates that efforts to support Libya’s coast guard and cooperation with local mayors are bearing fruit.
"In recent days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He reported on plans for further talks with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
“In Libya, we do not want to be associated with either side of the conflict.”
The Russian authorities have recently significantly intensified their policy in the Libyan direction, and delegations of opposing Libyan parties have visited Moscow.
The head of the Russian contact group on intra-Ukrainian settlement under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State Duma, the assistant of the head of the Chechen Republic Lev Dengov told "U", what goals Moscow is pursuing in this region and who is betting on.
Almost nothing is known about the contact group on Libya that you lead.
Here, let's say, the contact group on Ukraine - everyone knows about it.
And here is the veil of secrecy.
What exactly are you doing, what goals are you pursuing?
The contact group was established at the initiative of the Russian Foreign Ministry and the State Duma.
Its activities are supervised by the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimkhanov (Deputy of the Duma from Chechnya. - "U").
The latter is authorized to work in the Libyan direction by the Speaker of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodymyr.
The impetus for the creation of the group was the detention in Libya of the Russian tanker "Mechanik Chebotarev" (in September 2015, there were 11 people on board. - "<0xD0><0x95>").
We thought about how to help the crew.
Then a contact group of military specialists, representatives of the State Duma, was created, our work was supported by the head of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov.
How did you come to be the one who headed it?
Since I have been working in Libya since 2008, I have been asked to lead the group.
Our activities were not limited to the release of sailors from the "Mechanics of Chebotarev".
We have managed to establish contacts with representatives of all the main groups opposing each other in the Libyan conflict - and from Tripoli (where the recognized UN government is based headed by Faiz Sarajem. - "U"), and with Hafsa (the Hafsa's residence of the parliament, which opposes the government and supports the marshes).
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metig (Vice Prime Minister of Libya - "U"), we were able to quickly agree on the release of Russian sailors.
It was then decided to make more effective use of these contacts, to create a contact group.
Its task is to analyze the situation, identify key factors and players, dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I want to emphasize in particular: in Libya, we do not want to be associated with either side of the conflict, we are in dialogue with everyone.
How many people are in the contact group and how many of them are permanently in Libya?
There are currently five people in the contact group.
Among them are people with experience working in force structures, including in the Ministry of Defense.
We also want to include in the group of specialists on the region, representatives of the Institute of the Middle East RAS.
There is no permanent presence in Libya, and there is no need to do so.
There are Russian military advisers and instructors in Libya.
If so, on whose side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All conversations and publications about this do not correspond to reality.
But your contact group includes ex-militaries...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hotspots.
Or cities like Misurata (where militias are based, which played a role in the overthrow of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and significantly intensified in the following years).
We arrived in Misurata in January of this year.
We were scared, we were told that there were Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess the situation there, to analyze the real military potential, who is responsible for what, why there are such rumors, what is the role of Islamists there.
In Misrata we met with all the representatives of the detachments that were engaged in the destruction of ISIS in Sirte (in December 2016 this city on the Mediterranean coast was seized from the militants of the banned in Russia "Islamic State" - "U").
We wanted to see them, to get to know these people, to check the information that they were the ones who played a decisive role in the destruction of ISIS in Libya, and not Khalifa Haftar, who credited himself with these merits.
And to what conclusion did you come?
Is it not Haftar who won the Islamic State in Libya?
That's not what he did.
Haftar was conducting operations on another front, in Benghazi.
And ISIS in Sirte was fought by the structures subordinated to the government in Tripoli.
And, by the way, we invited people to Russia who carried out this anti-terrorist operation.
And they arrived - the visit lasted from April 19 to 23 of this year, the Libyan delegation was accepted in the Federation Council, in the Duma, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Rosgardia.
You, as we have understood, are in all Libyan regions and probably imagine the mood of local elites and field commanders.
Do you think it will be possible to implement the ceasefire agreements, the elections that Khalifa Haftar and Faiz Zaraj reached in Paris at the end of July?
Or again, as has happened repeatedly in the past, agreements will be broken, hostilities will resume, the parties will try to take power alone?
For us, a good signal was already the fact that Saraj and Haftar agreed to another meeting, not so long ago it was impossible.
In the recent past, both leaders have reacted extremely negatively to each other.
As for Russia's position...
It is often written and said that Moscow actively supports Haftar, many believe it.
We faced this situation when we were in Missouri, and Haftar was on board the Russian aircraft carrier “Admiral Kuznetsov” on that day.
It was a coincidence.
But in Missouri, they didn't believe in coincidence.
We were told, “You must be very brave people who came to us today.”
But our task is precisely to show: we are not only supporting Haftar, we are in dialogue with all key actors in the conflict in Libya.
You and Haftar were talking.
Does mutual understanding with Russian partners at the human, emotional level facilitate the fact that he studied twice in the USSR?
And, by the way, does Haftar know the Russian language?
If he knows Russian, then he is very relative.
But the fact that he has studied with us, of course, facilitates the dialogue with him.
And not just with him, by the way.
When we communicate with the military in Tripoli and Missouri, we meet generals who have studied either in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
And they speak Russian very well.
And they are drawn to Russia, to some extent they are nostalgic for it.
Do you consider it likely that the arms embargo against Libya will be lifted soon?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in the supply of Russian weapons?
They are interested, of course, but, as I said, we do not take sides in this conflict and would not like to arm one to the detriment of the other.
We would like everyone to be in a similar position.
As for the arms embargo, there are constant calls from the Libyans for Russia to somehow contribute to its lifting.
The process of drafting a constitution is now actively under way in Libya.
We hope that the parties will come to compromise decisions, achieve an internal consensus.
Then the elections should take place, as was mentioned at the meeting of Saraj and Haftar.
If elections are held and legitimate power is finally elected (and now neither party has such a status), it is possible to raise the question of lifting the arms embargo in the UN Security Council.
Raising this issue now is pointless and dangerous, it will only lead to an escalation of the conflict.
A few days ago, the media reported that Italy, faced with the problem of African refugees fleeing from Libya, feels left to chance by EU allies.
Can Moscow help its Italian partners in this situation by using its ties with Libyans?
How realistic is it, for example, that Haftar’s troops will establish control over the coast and put an end to the smuggling business of immigrants to Europe?
A very timely question.
We are actively working on this.
The Italians need Russia’s support because Moscow is in dialogue with Haftar, Saraje, Misurata and the south of the country.
Tribes in southern Libya play a major role in this, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Is it a question of the South intercepting the flows of migrants on long-distance approaches?
That is, conditionally speaking, did the buses that Nigerian migrants were travelling on deploying back?
That's what we're trying to do.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups are interested in keeping these flows going.
We hope to contribute to uniting the South in the negotiation process between Saraj, Haftar and the tribes in the South.
But first we would like to see the unity of opinion on this issue between Haftar and Saraje.
The head of government in Tripoli Faiz Saraj is considered an Islamist, a supporter of the introduction of Sharia law in the country.
How radical is his viewpoint?
Will this not be an obstacle to building relations with Russia or the West?
I will give my personal opinion about him.
In my opinion, he is, on the contrary, an opponent of radical Islam.
But there are Islamists in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself holds the position that Libya should be an absolutely normal country – moderately Islamic, open to the world.
It also actively fights against terrorists.
How does he have such a reputation?
It is created by those countries that are not interested in Russia communicating with Tripoli.
Tripoli is the capital, where there is legislative, executive and judicial power.
There is a national oil corporation, a national bank and other state structures.
Of course, some countries were interested in not going there.
And we mixed all the cards and began to actively communicate with Tripoli and Tobruk.
And we are already reaping the fruits of this work: Rosneft has concluded an agreement on cooperation with the state oil company of Libya - NOC.
NOC Director Mustafa Sanalla, with whom Rosneft head Igor Sechin made the deal, himself directly from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, the first shipment of Libyan oil company Rosneft took place.
What will Russia do with it?
I guess to resell.
What are Russia’s economic interests in Libya?
It is planned to resign the contracts signed under Muammar Gaddafi.
These include, in particular, previous agreements in the field of transport (railway construction), energy (electrification) and a number of others.
Do the Libyans have anything to pay?
Well, they have oil.
That is to say, as in the case of Iran, is it about the “oil in exchange for services” scheme?
I do not know what the scheme will be, I do not deal with these questions directly.
In fact, the economy for Russia in Libya is not the main thing.
We are, in fact, doing peacekeeping work there.
For us, the main thing is to stop the bloodshed, to help the Libyans negotiate with each other so that they can establish order and Libya has ceased to be a conducive environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, this is the main task - to help the Libyan people and to extort terrorists from there.
Do you have data on the presence in Libya (now or before) of radical militants from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to find out.
I met with a representative of the Libyan State Security Committee, who said that to date there is no one from Russia and other countries of the former USSR there.
He said that he has about 50,000 records of telephone conversations of representatives of Islamist and radical groups (in Libya - "U") and the Russian speech does not sound there.
What countries are these militants from?
I wouldn't want to go into that detail.
Then let's formulate the question differently.
How many of the Islamic militants in Libya are Libyans themselves?
There are almost no Libyans among them, no more than 5%.
The rest are incoming.
Can Moscow hold intra-Libyan talks on the example of Paris?
There are plans like that.
We are in active negotiations with the Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow and have declared their readiness to come to Moscow or Grozny.
When can such negotiations take place?
It's hard to say right now.
Several more visits are yet to take place, and then, I hope, there will be clarity about the time and place of negotiations.
In the Czech Museum charities collected money for an expensive gift to a sick boy
In the sub-Moscow museum-reservation "Melichovo" a nine-year-old boy Sasha Matsola, who has DCP, hydrocephalus of the brain and complete blindness, on August 5 will receive as a gift a specialized running track.
A useful present will be presented to Sasha Minister of Culture of the Moscow region Oksana Kosareva and the director of the museum Konstantin Bobkov.
The money for the gym was collected during the charity marathon "Don't get tired of doing good", which was held in Melikhov on July 15 on the Day of Remembrance of Chekhov.
On the eve of the marathon at the museum, Sasha, who lives in the village of Manushkino Chekhov district, received a letter: "I can't see my eyes at all, so I asked my mother to write this letter".
“I’d really like to get a runway as a gift so that my feet would become strong and I’d learn to walk a little bit.”
And Sasha's dream came true!
After the presentation in the museum-reservation will take place "Concert-postscriptum" - a famous pianist, the honored artist of Russia Alexander Gindin will perform popurries from popular classical works.
During the charity marathon in Melikhov, the choir of the Voznesenskaya Davydova Desert, the bellers of the workshop of Ilya Drozdikhin, the students of the Moscow Conservatory named after P.I. Tchaikovsky and the Russian Academy named after Gnesin, the artists of the Melikhov Studio Theatre "Chekh".
For visitors, auctions were held, a book fair and a charity sale of souvenir products with the marathon logo were organized.
The museum-reservation "Melichovo" took the initiative to make the Day of Remembrance of Chekhov on July 15 a single day of charity in all the museums of Moscow.
A 30-year-old resident of the Olevska Zhytomyr region near a local football stadium shot several times in the direction of the teenagers who were there.
According to the suspect, he was annoyed by the noise, FACTAM reported in the communication department of the Zhytomyr region police.
After that, the man walked into a cafe located nearby.
In the building he had a conflict, during which the man used a device to shoot rubber bullets, injuring one of the visitors.
The 34-year-old victim has been provided with necessary medical care, there is no threat to his life.
Police and ambulance arrived at the scene, but the shooter had escaped by this time.
Law enforcement officers identified him and arrested him on the same day, August 2.
The man could not explain his actions.
He has seized a device for firing rubber bullets, which is sent for examination.
According to this fact, criminal proceedings under Article 296 (bullying) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine have been initiated.
The detainee is threatened with imprisonment for a period of 3 to 7 years.
Recall that in Kiev on Lukyanovka in the area of Tatarskaya Street on the night of July 28 there was an attack with a shooting.
Michelle Carter Sentenced for Reporting Conrad Roy's Suicide
A Massachusetts resident has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for inciting her boyfriend Conrad Roy to commit suicide by texting and calling.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will have to serve 15 months behind bars and another five years of probation.
Carter was found guilty in June of the unintentional murder of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father said at a hearing Thursday: “My family was killed by grief.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was allowed to remain at large until the appeal.
She was threatened with a maximum term of 20 years, but her lawyers said that both she and Roy suffered from mental disorders.
Carter, dressed in red pants and a cream blouse, listened to the sentence standing, shaking hands and lowering his eyes.
"With her actions, she killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
“She interrupted his life to improve hers.
She did not accept responsibility,” she said.
“She didn’t show any regrets.”
But Carter’s lawyer said it was “a tragic case that she deeply regrets.”
However, Judge Lawrence Monis said that, in his opinion, her "age, level of maturity, or even mental illness did not significantly affect her actions."
The prosecutor read Roy's mother Lynn Roy's statement, which read: "Not a single day has passed since I mourned the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I'm doing - I'm trying to support his sisters, despite all the pain that will stay with us forever."
Roy’s sister, Camdin Roy, said she was haunted by the idea that she would never be able to attend his wedding or be the aunt of his children.
“Drowning the person who has been with me ever since I was born is a pain that will stay with me for the rest of my life,” she said.
This case would appear to be a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that would hold a person responsible for advising him to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found dead in a car with symptoms of carbon dioxide poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
The case caught the attention of the whole country when it became known that he was pushed to suicide by Carter's message.
"You can hang yourself, jump off the roof, stabb yourself with a knife, I don't know there are many ways," she wrote in several messages sent two weeks before his death when he was resting with his family.
A few minutes before her suicide, she wrote, "You have to do this, Conrad" and "You just have to turn on the ignition, and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Monis said Carter wanted to get attention with Roy's death, and forbade her from speaking to the press to keep her from getting what she wanted.
The views of the lawyers on this matter were divided.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of murdering her British neighbor's apartment in Italy and acquitted two years later.
The 30-year-old published in the Los Angeles Times her special opinion, stating: "Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prisons."
Yevgeny Bogachev: "I let Langford go like a bird of high flight"
One of the best basketball players of the VTB Single League, 33-year-old Keith Langford left UNIX.
The departure of the American defender "Izvestia" commented on the president of UNIX Yevgeny Bogachev.
Keith made this decision on family circumstances, - said Yevgeny Bogachev.
He has a small child, a wife, who did not want to move to Kazan.
Keith wants to be closer to home.
I decided to meet him.
Of course, I could have said no and extended his contract, but he deserved a different relationship.
He played in UNIX for three seasons and in each match showed a high level, laid out on all 100%.
So I let him go like a high-flying bird.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in his family life and playing career.
Keith Langford played at the Kazan club for three years, winning silver in the 2015/16 United League.
In the 2016/17 season, he won the award for the most successful player of the Euroleague season.
He scored 21.75 points on average per game.
This is the second result since the award was established in 2004.
Langford, who also won the award in 2014, became the second player in the history of the Euroleague to receive this award more than once.
In the near future, Langford will sign a contract with China's Shenzhen, Eurohoops reports.
The U.S. is expected to sign a two-year contract worth $5 million.
Langford will be the second Euroleague star to move to the Chinese championship in July.
Earlier in the Chinese CBA moved ex-center "Panatinykos" Iannis Burusis.
A tourist burned in the sun from Moscow was evacuated by helicopter in Adygea
Adygean rescuers today by helicopter evacuated from the mountainous area of the republic of the suburban tourist, who received the strongest solar burns.
The man rested in the Fist shelter, located at an altitude of 1,600 meters.
The 27-year-old tourist had increased blood pressure, as well as difficulty breathing.
Preliminary diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
The rescuers were approached by the head of the tour group, who said that the burned man received in the campaign.
Audi plans to modify up to 850,000 diesel cars
A day before the announcement by Audi, BMW said it would offer to update the software to more than 350,000 vehicles.
The chairman of BMW said the company believes “there are smarter ways than driving restrictions,” referring to European cities — including Munich, where BMW is located — that were considering banning or restricting the use of diesel cars.
Daimler said on Thursday it was modifying three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies called their move a recall.
European automakers have actively promoted the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to promote compliance with the rules on carbon emissions.
But the nitrogen oxides that eject diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost for automakers to install equipment that neutralizes the exhaust gases of diesel cars is also increasing, and maintaining a competitive price for cars is becoming difficult.
While German automakers are under close scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government has also accused it of harassing influential automakers and ignoring signs of a problem.
The companies are trying not to repeat the mistake of Volkswagen, which concealed the use of so-called “destructive devices” that during testing could adjust the amount of harmful gases emitted to comply with the rules, and in the conditions of normal driving were switched off.
In the United States, an indictment has been issued against several Volkswagen executives, the rest of whom are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of the thermodynamics department was arrested in Germany as part of the Audi engine development team.
The former manager, Zacqueo Giovanni Pamio, an Italian, and therefore unprotected from extradition and may appear in court in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi came under German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing the system to circumvent European emissions rules and expanded the investigation, which had previously focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could create serious problems for Volkswagen: the manufacturer of elite cars is a source of a disproportionate share of Volkswagen’s revenue.
In Astrakhan, the visitor of the cafe paid with fake money
The police received a message from the employee of the bank's office about the discovery of the recalculation of funds received from the point of general food, a suspicious bill with the denomination of 5 thousand rubles.
A study conducted at the Expert-Criminalist Center found it to be a fake.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia in the Astrakhan region, a banknote paid for one of the visitors of the cafe, who bought a shaurma.
It is worth noting that the cash register was not equipped with a device to determine the authenticity of the banknotes.
Currently, the police are established persons involved in the manufacture and sale of a knowingly fake ticket of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.
Such crimes are punishable by imprisonment for up to 8 years with a fine of up to 1 million rubles.
The Regional Office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs encourages the residents of the Astrakhan region to be cautious when carrying out financial transactions; workers of trade facilities are recommended to install devices to verify the authenticity of the funds received.
Astronomers have found a "hell" planet on which even iron can melt
For the first time, after studying the properties of the stratosphere of a giant exoplanet called WASP-121b, astrophysicists were much surprised by its temperature, which is able to evaporate iron and other metals.
Experts have noticed that water molecules are so heated by starlight that they emit infrared radiation.
The Hubble telescope captured the glow of water molecules on this gas giant: this high temperature causes the water in the planet's atmosphere to glow in the infrared range.
WASP-121b refers to the so-called "hot Jupiters" - gas giants, in size and mass comparable to the largest planet in the solar system, but located dozens of times closer to the parent star.
Because of this, the year on the exoplanet lasts only 1.3 "Earth" days, and its gas shell is hardened to almost 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change threatens lavender in Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provence and southern France, but now there are fears that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender has become worse growing due to dry weather and disease-carrying insects; this has caused constant headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find a solution.
Eric Sess, an expert at CRIEPPAM, an agricultural research institute in Provence, said: “Lavender in Provence is really under threat because in recent years this plant has been feeling the effects of climate change: in the spring and especially in the fall the rains have become much less.
This affects the lifespan of lavender.
And there are also small cicadas jumping on the leaves of insects that carry microbacteria; in very dry weather they become very many."
A lot has been put on the map.
Lavender not only attracts vacationers; lavender oil is in high demand in perfumery and cosmetology.
Eric Sess says, “Instead of very long snails with a large number of large flowers, we have small, underdeveloped, weakened, or absent ones.
Therefore, we have fewer parts containing essential oil.”
The solutions currently under consideration include improving water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, as well as spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and removing varieties that are more drought-resistant.
Ambassador of the Winter Universiade-2019 met with Krasnoyarsk schoolchildren
The two-time world champion in hockey, Ambassador of the Winter Universiade-2019 Alexander Semin met the day before with the beginning hockey players and gave autographs to the fans.
The meeting was held in the tent of the Winter Universiade 2019 as part of a thematic week dedicated to hockey with a washer.
Any visitor to the tent could go skating on artificial ice.
In addition, relays, quizzes and games with the drawing of souvenir products of student games, warm-up from the aerobics federation were organized.
Fifty schoolchildren participated in the event.
Alexander Semin advised the boys to do as much as possible on the sports grounds and stressed that the most important thing at the initial stage of training is hard work and a huge desire to do hockey.
“It is great that there is such a platform in Krasnoyarsk as the tent of the Winter Universiade 2019, where beginners can directly ask questions to the coaches of the teams,” the champion said.
It should be noted that the ambassadors of the Winter Universiade-2019 help to promote student sports and a healthy lifestyle among Krasnoyarsk people.
The tent of the Universiade will work throughout the summer season until September 25, according to the press service of the Winter Universiade-2019 Directorate.
In the State Department commented the words of Medvedev
U.S. State Department official Heather Nauert, commenting at a briefing on the words of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, said the need to find "areas for interaction" with Russia.
According to her, such areas must be found in order to "improve bilateral cooperation".
An example of such successful cooperation, Nauert called the truce agreement on Syria.
We are two nuclear superpowers.
"And people around the world agree that the United States and Russia should be able to work with each other," the diplomat said.
At the same time, Nauert refused to comment on Medvedev’s assertion of a full-fledged trade war between Russia and the United States.
“If Russia has said so, then of course it has the right to speak, but I can’t say anything more on this topic,” the State Department spokeswoman said.
Earlier, U.S. President Donald Trump signed a bill to tighten sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new package of sanctions, the head of the Russian government Medvedev said that Washington declared a full-fledged trade war on Moscow, putting an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also said U.S. sanctions would be in place for decades.
In addition, according to the prime minister, the American establishment "purely defeated" Trump.
Missing bodybuilder found in a foreign country lost his memory in Moscow.
Bodybuilder Shamil Khanmetov disappeared on the road to Noginsk on July 25 under very spicy circumstances: he came out of the car to go to the toilet.
For seven days he was unsuccessfully searched by acquaintances and locals.
And Shamil was found in someone else's cottage in Ramensky.
He was found naked by the owner in his bathroom.
The Dagestan athlete could not explain how he ended up here and what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember his name, and his passport was missing.
The announcements of his disappearance helped establish his identity.
The doctors who arrived on the call recorded a partial loss of memory and a brain injury in Khanmetov, Mash reported.
There are other surprises for athletes as well.
The intruders who kidnapped Shamil have probably already visited his apartment, the keys of which he also stole.
Oil and gas revenues in July exceeded the forecast by 7.4 billion rubles
The actual oil and gas revenues received at the end of July 2017 exceeded the estimate by 7.4 billion rubles, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation reports.
The excess, the agency explains, occurred mainly due to the higher exchange rate of the US dollar to the ruble compared to the June average used for the estimate, as well as due to the excess of the actual volume of gas production and the volume of exports of petroleum products at the projected levels.
"The deviation of the oil and gas revenues of the federal budget from the monthly estimate, corresponding to the Federal Budget Act for 2017-2019, in August 2017 is projected in the amount of +40.2 billion rubles," the Ministry of Finance said in a statement.
Thus, the total amount of funds directed to purchase foreign currency in the domestic currency market in the period from August 7 to September 6, 2017 is 47.6 billion rubles.
Accordingly, the daily volume of purchase of foreign currency will be in the equivalent of 2.07 billion rubles.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in the purchase of foreign currency by the Ministry of Finance.
Each working day during the specified period, the Central Bank will enter into transactions of purchase of foreign currency at organized trades of the Moscow Stock Exchange evenly during the trading day.
The purchased foreign currency will be credited to the accounts of the Federal Treasury in the Central Bank.
The killing of a journalist underscores that it is becoming more and more dangerous in Mexico.
Employees of the weekly newspaper "Riodos" usually meet on Wednesdays to discuss plans to shed light on the latest violent crimes in Sinaloa state related to organized crime, corrupt officials or the ongoing war of drug dealers.
But today, overwhelmed by their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They were told to change their habits.
The two senior journalists discussed what seemed safer: taking children with them to an office where they had already dropped a grenade in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote on the board hanging in the room, three words: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They asked journalists to name names for each column - no evidence is needed, suspicion and inner feelings will suffice.
These are drug dealers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being detained by the government or by cartels, a whole list of scoundrels who are making it dangerous to expose chaos in Mexico.
Violence is not breathing, and among the corpses that are multiplying in the country, more and more journalists: according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 since President Enrico Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 people after the attacks and threats are under federal protection; and this year at least seven people have been killed.
Among the latter - their publisher and inspiring, the co-founder of "Riodas" Javier Valdes Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist,” Valdes wrote in one of his numerous books on drug-related violent crimes.
His absence feels very acute, although his presence is everywhere - a large photograph of Valdez, showing the middle finger, with the inscription "Justice" hanging on the facade of the building "Riodos"; two reporters of the 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, are wearing T-shirts, on which he is depicted.
The seminar takes place less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their common trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was set up in 2010 to investigate journalistic cases, only two cases have been investigated so far, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.
As is the case with most of the thousands of murders committed each year related to drug trafficking and organized crime, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
Riodos journalists insist that they will write about the violence in Sinaloa, although they are killed by grief, although it is now much more dangerous around.
“Without information about the killers, without justice from security talks at meetings, there is little use,” Ibarra says.
“It’s very stupid to spend time at this seminar,” he says.
“Until we know the reason, we suspect everyone.”
On the morning of May 15, Valdes left the office of Riodos in the capital of the state of Culiac<0xC3><0xA1>n.
He only managed to drive a couple of blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was pulled out of the car and shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which means "Twelfth River".
The shooter drove off in his car and smashed it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He has a wife and two adult children.
Rumors usually spread quickly around Kuliakana.
But almost everyone is silent about Valdez.
Since Guzm<0xC3><0xA1>n was arrested and extradited to the United States in January last year, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country as rival factions struggle to fill the resulting vacuum.
Not to mention that one or more people are killed every day on the streets of Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with painted two-story mausoleums of drug lords, which are larger than the homes of many living people.
Forget for a moment that the state of “quietness” is simply when one of the cartels takes control of the coastal state with important ports and routes of drug trafficking leading to the United States.
Despite this and the fact that Waldes was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bohorquez, a 60-year-old co-founder and director of Rio de Janeiro, is crushed by a sense of guilt for failing to protect a friend.
He thinks that the murder was helped by two mistakes.
First, in February, an interview was published with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival factions of the cartel, which is at war with the sons of Guzman.
The publication may have angered the sons; the people who were supposedly gang members bought all copies of the publication as soon as they were delivered to the kiosks.
The second mistake was that he didn’t force Waldes to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper that wrote about the same story was captured.
Waldes was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as another milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had been out of danger for so long, his friends and colleagues thought he would always be.
He was an experienced reporter at Noroest and in 2003, together with five colleagues, founded Riodos, selling his $50 shares.
In Sinaloa, “it was impossible to engage in journalism without touching on the topic of drugs,” Bohorkes said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest publishing, sales and advertising revenues grew.
Journalists liked that they could publish bold reports without fear of censorship, and readers were attracted that in this edition they could read about what no one else dared to write about.
Eight years after its founding, Rio de Janeiro received the prestigious Maria Moores Cabo Award for Reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdes won the International Press Freedom Prize for his courage in investigating drug trafficking in Mexico, wherever it may lead.
He honestly admitted that he was scared.
"I want to live on," he said at the CPJ award ceremony.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is “a way of life,” he said in October last year in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
“You have to accept the tasks that lie on you as a journalist – either that or you’re just a fool.”
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do when there were so many deaths around... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
The employees of Riodos miss Valdes, a joker who quarreled like a loader in a port, a friend, generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to get along alive.
They depended on the order they set.
He always had to wear his hat.
He was supposed to go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: has his love for the once-established order ruined him?
His death also caused them to question their calculations of how best to do their job and stay alive.
“They don’t like it when you get to know their wives, their children, their legal business, and underground drug-carrying airports.
“These things were over the line,” Bohorkes said.
The result, even in the best of times, was a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
Stay away from what smells bad.
The problem, says Riodos editor Andrés Villarreal, is that “the deception can be deceived ... and then what happened to Javier happens.”
The old rules, he says, no longer work in Sinaloa — as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where there is a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak state institutions and corrupt officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where the employees of Rio de Janeiro gathered for security training, it was suddenly forbidden to bring mobile phones: a few days before it became known that spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, is used in Mexico to monitor journalists and public activists.
Outside, two police officers hide in the shade of a tree from a 104-degree heat (40 degrees Celsius).
They were given the task of the state government to guard the office of “Riodos”, which is located in a four-storey building in the bourgeois quarter of Kuliakan.
Some journalists asked half-jokingly whether these policemen were among the 50 percent of the law and order that the governor himself said could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to a mountainous area that is de facto under the control of drug gangs.
In the next issue, "Riodos" counted on three main themes.
This is the murder in Sinaloa of the brother of former boxing champion Julio César Chavez.
They also had the disclosure of government expenditures concentrated in the governor's hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping of people at one of the most expensive restaurants in Kuliakana, a block from the prosecutor's office.
It was not officially announced who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it was necessary to be careful when it came time to write about what everyone in the city knew: that it was a favorite restaurant of both drug dealers and authorities.
One of their journalists learned from open databases that the restaurant was registered to a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated all levels of government for almost the past century.
Recently, several governors from the PRI have been loudly accused of corruption.
Villarreal asked reporters to write about previous incidents at the restaurant, including when Guzman’s son El Chapo escaped from the military raid.
A few months ago, readers would have searched for a column of Waldes with the most credible information about the kidnapping.
“We would have known before what happened,” says 46-year-old Villarreal, for his slim physique dubbed “El Flaco.”
“Today, all channels of communication with our sources are broken.”
Waldes’s office is now used as a warehouse for posters and stickers protesting the killings of journalists because employees have become what they never thought they would become: activists speaking on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took several posters and went the next morning to a demonstration at the local prosecutor’s office dedicated to another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the state of Michoacan in the west of the country three days after he was killed by Waldes.
They found a burned body, and the authorities said it was him, based on DNA tests.
Journalists across the country began to speak out louder, organize protests and write "SOS Press" on the sidewalks and walls of houses.
On that day, Director Bohorquez was in Washington, trying to secure international support for the demand for justice in the Waldes case.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloa the day after Valdez’s murder, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and ordering their killing for telling the truth.
She then asked her not to give her any more information on the Government’s activities, fearing that anger would harm her objectivity.
Waldes has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are “surrounded” by organized crime, its accomplices in the government, and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, Drug Journalism, he wrote that reporters are not just killed by gangs of drug traffickers; they do so on the orders of politicians and security services colluding with organized crime.
The Article 19 Press Protection Committee believes that half of the attacks on journalists last year were carried out by order of the police and government officials.
“In Mexico, you die because they want to shut you up,” Ramirez said.
Of course, murders frighten people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Masias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
On her body was found a note allegedly written on behalf of the Zetas cartel: “I’m here because of my articles.”
The computer keyboard and headphones were lying next to her severed head.
Some newspapers have preferred to close down, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after its correspondent, Miroslav Brich, was killed in March.
Others continue to hold on as Nuevo Laredo’s “El Manjana” after the murder of its leader in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez publicly addressed drug cartels with an editorial on the front page titled “What do you want from us?”
Some journalists have left their home states or the country at all.
It's a painful decision.
In exile, it is difficult to find work, and they are still looking for danger in the streets.
And they are sometimes killed, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was killed in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Those who stay and continue to work balance daily between risky decisions.
Ibarra - who once dreamed of being a poet - admits that he is afraid to write about drug trafficking.
“Mexico is going to hell, and that’s why I became a journalist,” he says.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the last issue was ready for printing, the publishers of "Riodos" sat on the sidewalk next to the office and drank beer when suddenly their phones rang at the same time.
A series of shootings between opposing gangs and security forces near the resort town of Masatlan left behind 19 bodies, according to confirmed data.
The war continued to flare up, as promised in a series of messages from cartels discovered in the area.
Sitting on the sidewalk, they posted the news via their mobile phone on the website of "Riodos".
The next day I had to revisit the first page.
Sirens roared nearby - another shooting in the vicinity.
Bohorkes looked to see if the police guards were ready to defend them.
If they were scared, they didn’t show it.
Sitting under a huge portrait of the deceased founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was exposed to the sight of the whole of Sinaloa, the employees of "Riodos" continued his case.
"How can you think of closing," said Bohorkes, "if on the same day that Javier was killed, the trainee asked me to send her out to report?"
The dinosaur used camouflage to avoid enemies.
At first glance, it appears to be a statue, although it is horrifying.
The researchers said the first found remains of a rhinoceros-sized creature found by a Canadian miner survived so well that experts called it “My Lisa Among Dinosaurs.”
It was so well preserved that they could even determine that the color of his scaly skin was reddish-brown — and say that he had, in a way, a “dark past.”
In a report published in the journal Modern Biology, it was described as "the best-preserved of Thyreophorus in the history of the finds and one of the best specimens of the dinosaur in the world".
This fossil is a recently found specimen of a nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredible good condition has stunned researchers who call him “really remarkable.”
This herbivorous thyrophore is the best-preserved fossil of its kind in the history of the finds, according to articles in the journal National Geographic.
He was found by Sean Fank when he was working at the Sancor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He stumbled upon something that seemed different from the surrounding breed, and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontological Museum.
For the next six years, work was carried out to detect an animal inside a 2,500-foot (1,100-kg) earthen fungus.
Now that all this hard work is done, the finished result can be demonstrated.
“It’s only worth a little snooze, and you can almost believe that he’s asleep,” said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrell Paleontological Museum, where the creation is shown.
“It will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and well-preserved specimens of dinosaurs – the Mona Lisa among the dinosaurs.”
Studying his skin, the researchers found that it was herbivorous, despite the fact that it was covered with armor and resembled a walking tank, apparently exposed to significant danger from carnivorous dinosaurs.
This powerful armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a protective technique known as protective paint, which is also used by many animals today.
This would allow it to merge more quickly with the environment and avoid encountering enemies, experts say, assuming it was hunted by larger dinosaurs.
This 110-million-year-old creature, belonging to the nodosaur family, was widely illuminated in the press in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrell Museum of Paleontology.
Scientists have already studied the animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli in honor of museum lab worker Mark Mitchell, one of the members of the group who spent more than 7,000 hours excavating it.
The astonishing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the drawing and shape of scales and armor plates on his body.
They discovered a protective paint, a common method of protection in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom.
Although protective coloring is common, the discovery came as a surprise, because the size of the Borealopelta dinosaur is significantly larger than the size of the currently living animals with protective coloring.
It can be assumed that this dinosaur was so actively hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution preferred to disguise confrontation as a way of survival.
But most modern animals with protective paint—such as deer, zebras, or armored animals—are much smaller in size and are more affordable prey, suggesting that the nodosaurus had to fight seriously for survival.
“A serious threat from predators to a massive, powerful dinosaur armored creature shows just how dangerous Melo period predator dinosaurs were,” Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in the dinosaur’s scale also suggests that its skin was supposed to be reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal in search of information about its life, including the preserved contents of its digestive tract, to find out what it ate during its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and was carried into the sea, where it sank and with its back down lay on the bottom of the ocean.
At the time, Alberta was as warm as it is now in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans likely spread far deeper into the land than they do now.
“This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, and at the same time is completely preserved in three dimensions, preserving the animal’s original shape,” Brown said.
“As a result, the animal now looks almost the same as it looked then, in the Early Mellow Period.
You don’t have to use your imagination to recreate it, you just have to snooze a little, and you can almost believe that it’s asleep.”
The Mela period is the era when giant theropods, flesh-eating dinosaurs standing on two legs, roamed the Earth.
Although the most remarkable of them, the tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, the thyreophorus could have been hunted by one of its formidable ancestors.
These include the acrocantosaurus, a 38-foot-long (11.5-meter) monster weighing six tons.
Scientists, whose latest findings are published in the journal Modern Biology, believe that Borealopelta was taken to the sea after death and mummified in the ivy.
The creature was found by Sean Fank when he was working at the Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum’s staff, it is the best-preserved thyrophore in the world, along with the skin and armor, and it’s all the way from the muzzle to the thigh bones.
On average, these creatures reached about 18 feet (five meters) in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kilograms).
Their characteristic feature was two twenty-inch spikes protruding from the shoulders.
The researchers believe that this herbivorous thyrophore has been hard hit by what is now Canada until the spilling river carried it into the open sea.
But the dinosaur's underwater burial preserved his armor with precision to the smallest detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen have been preserved so well that the remains of the skin still cover the crumpled armor plates along the dinosaur’s skull.
As Michael Mishko wrote in an article for National Geographic magazine, such a degree of preservation is “rare as winning a lottery.”
The longer I look at him, the more striking he seems.
The fossilized remains of the skin still cover the crumpled armor plates that soak up the animal’s skull.
His right front leg is stretched along the side, five fingers on it are turned upside down.
I can count the scales on his sole.”
Mikhail Saakashvili managed to get to Poland without documents
Mikhail Saakashvili, who previously headed Georgia and then the Odessa region in Ukraine, flew to Poland.
At the same time, he did this without having documents confirming his identity and citizenship.
The arrival of Saakashvili is reported by the Polish publication Telewizja Republika, which posted on its YouTube channel a video of his performance.
Saakashvili spoke at an event in honor of the anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising against Hitler's troops in 1944.
Since the politician does not know Polish, although he tried to start speaking in this language, he had to speak English through a Polish translator.
During his speech, the politician touched on the topic of cooperation between Georgia and Poland, and also spoke about Ukraine.
About the fact that the migration service of Ukraine has deprived his citizenship, the opal politician learned while in the United States.
How exactly he managed to make a transatlantic flight without documents is not yet known.
Former governor of Odessa region Mikhail Saakashvili said that his signature on the questionnaire for obtaining citizenship of Ukraine was forged.
The politician stressed that he did not fill out any questionnaires.
The period of investigation in the case of Weinzier and Olkhovyk has been extended until January
The period of preliminary investigation into the case of the co-owner of the group of companies "Renova" Evgeny Olhovyk and the head of the energy holding "T Plus" Boris Weinsicher has been extended until January 2, 2018.
On Thursday, August 3, the Basmann court is considering the extension of the accused's house arrest.
The representative of the SC at the meeting reported on the decision to extend the period of preliminary investigation for the last time.
"The special complexity and duration of the investigation is due to the need to seize and conduct an examination of a large number of documents, as well as conduct investigative actions on the territory of several Russian entities," the investigator said.
He added that the suspects regularly gave bribes to Comey's leadership.
Their total size is estimated at at least a billion rubles.
According to the investigation, Weinsicher, Olhovyk, as well as the former head of JSC "Complex energy systems" Mikhail Slobodin, who until September 5 headed the company "Vympelnerg", was also transferred to the highest officials of the Republic of Komi for the establishment of maximum bribes.
Weinzier and Olkhovik were arrested, staged in Syktyvkar and arrested for two months, Slobodin escaped from the investigation and was declared a federal search.
How did one activist find out the answer to the question “Whose streets?”
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shocked.
Just a day after arriving in New York as part of a tourist trip, a native of St. Louis was sitting on a bed in an apartment rented through Airbnb, viewing a Facebook tape on her phone.
She stumbled upon the post of someone from high school.
“The police just killed an eighteen-year-old child, and he’s still lying in the middle of the street.”
Paying attention to the fact that no one else in her tape posted this information, puzzled, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
There were a lot of user reposts with Nick <0x40>TheePharoah in her tape.
A rapper from Greater St. Louis tweeted about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black eighteen-year-old who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photo of Brown’s lifeless body, spread out in the middle of the street, where it will be four hours.
“It’s wild,” Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her circle.
She put her phone down, and later that night she came back to tweets that people were going to Canfield Drive.
There were photos of the signal tape and screaming people and the man who claimed to be Brown’s father, holding a poster saying, “A Ferguson cop just killed my unarmed son!”
She watched a live broadcast as a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another policeman, she said, took a shotgun and shouted, “I’ll kill you all...animals!”
“It’s a non-standard situation,” Ferrell said at the time, according to her own memoirs.
“It’s not murder like the ones we’re used to and we can call typical.
At that moment, I felt cold.
I was angry and I was crying.”
She took a return ticket and flew home the next day.
Landing at 11 p.m., she took her six-year-old daughter out of her father's house and decided that they would both go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next almost three years became the subject of the new documentary “Whose Streets?”, which will be released on August 11.
It is a story about survival and protest, about love and loss, strength and endurance from the point of view of people living in a community and filling the streets, demanding answers.
While Ferrell was traveling to Ferguson with her daughter, dressed in a flower dress and a wreath of color, they remembered the conversation that had taken place before this morning countless times, “about the experience of the blacks and their position.”
She recalls saying, “Do you remember how I told you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?
We’re going to Ferguson right now because a policeman killed an 18-year-old boy, and that was wrong.”
“I couldn’t help but take it,” Ferrell said later.
“What is happening today is the culmination of what happened before.
She needs to know about it, see it, and grow up on it.
She must not only understand activism and organization well, but also understand the different levels of experience of blacks and their positions and what we must do to become free in order to be liberated.
Even if I manage to provide her with an environment in which she herself will not face obvious racism, she is no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I would have done her a disservice if I had stopped her from doing it.”
When they arrived in Ferguson, they made their first stop on South Florissant Road, on the site across the road from a police station that had become something of a tent camp, while activists were waiting for reports of officer Derren Uil’s final indictment.
There, Ferrell and his daughter joined a local businessman who cooked lunch packages.
They collected the bags and helped distribute them to the protesters.
Little by little, Ferrell took the form of a new type of activism.
“My activism has completely changed since August 9,” she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was the president of the Association of Student Healthy People, a national minority, and engaged in food justice and health inequalities among blacks.
“I didn’t have the experience of an organizer.
It came by itself.”
A few weeks later, at the evening demonstration, Ferrel met Sabaa Folayan, one of her directors.
Folayan said she and her chief operator, Lucas Alvarado-Ferrer, "just wanted to document" the events.
Ferrell came up with the question: “Do you want to document, or are you trying to find a story to play on?”
This skepticism was infused with numerous people, often white, who came to the community in order to benefit from its pain and endurance.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, “We heard that the voices of people who were born and raised in Ferguson were not in the spotlight, and they wanted to do it differently.”
By that time, Folayan had teamed up with her director Damon Davis, a local artist known for his activism on death row issues.
His involvement aroused a sense of sympathy for Ferrell and six other local residents with whom the Whose Streets? project team had been in touch for years after Brown’s murder.
“In this documentary, no one speaks for us or with us, we speak for ourselves,” Davis said.
“It was the most important thing to me about how these people will be represented, because that’s how I’ll be represented.”
And although the goal of the project was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - in an effort to show that the movement "is not about the leader-savior, but about how the community unites", as Folayan said - it turned out to be the most open of the participants in the film.
As a result, Whose Streets? shows unexpectedly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as how she fell in love and married her wife.
“I felt naked,” Ferrell said, laughing about seeing the finished product for the first time.
“But I realized that when you do that kind of work and humanize black people, there has to be some level of vulnerability.”
In addition, Ferrell’s story again discusses and emphasizes the role of a black homosexual woman in the broader context of the “Life of Black Matters” movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement — those who created the #BlackLivesMatter tag on social media after the 2012 murder of black teenager Trayvon Martin — classify themselves as homosexuals.
“Black homosexual women in leadership positions support all this movement,” Ferrell says, “because we are constantly fighting on several fronts.
Black gay women have to bear all of this burden.”
Folayan agreed with this claim, noting that “the movement is actually supported by black women and a lot of gay black women.”
However, she insists that "this is not a case of positive discrimination", and that Ferrell was not chosen as the central character of the film due to its distinctive features.
“She was the person who awakened that energy,” she said.
“On the other hand, it’s no coincidence that she was in the foreground because when”
You can feel her energy through the screen.”
Meanwhile, Ferguson has long been without film cameras, but there remain complex racial ties between the community and the police.
Ferrel will be on probation for another two-and-a-half years for shutting down the highway during the demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the place she calls home, simply: “Bardak.”
She's still holding on to the speech she learned when she took to the streets of Ferguson full three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains.”
Two El Salvador players disqualified for biting U.S. players
Salvadoran footballers Henry Romero and Darwin Seren have received long-term disqualifications for unsportsmanlike behavior.
During the quarter-final match of the Gold Cup of the Confederations of Football of North and Central America and the Caribbean (CONCACAF), the Salvadorans bit the American players.
The first was defender Henry Romero.
The Salvadoran bit the attacker, Josie Altidor, and then pinched him to the chest.
Then the midfielder Serene, when submitting the corner in his penalty area, bit the US defender Omar Gonzalez.
As a result, Romero was disqualified for three games and Serene for six.
The meeting itself ended with the victory of the Americans with a score of 2: 0, reports Goal.com.
The emergence of similarity: the artist creates portraits with the help of the DNA of Chelsea Manning
In the center of the hall in the Friedman Gallery in New York, the faces of people hanging from the ceiling on the wire - white, black and brown, all somewhat elusively similar to each other.
These 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Harborg from cheek smears and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent clippings from Fort Levenworth Prison, where a former intelligence analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for the famous transmission of confidential diplomatic telegrams on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called "The Emergence of Similarity".
This is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Harborg, whose art combines technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transgender woman and famous dissident whom Barack Obama softened just three days before the end of his presidency.
Analyzing the DNA from Manning's computer program and using it to create three-dimensional portraits of faces that could be in people with such a genome, Dewey-Harborg created a deep, albeit not easy-to-perceive, intuitive manifesto devoted not only to the plasticity of their DNA data, but also to the intuitability of their DNA data.
Manning, who was born under the name of Bradley Edward, but since her teenage years has said openly that she considers herself a woman, was sentenced in 2013 to 20 episodes, including six violations of the Espionage, Computer Fraud and Theft Act.
Her photographs in prison were inaccessible, so only one of her photographs was known: a grainy black and white selfie, in which Manning in a platinum shade wig, clearly feeling awkward, sat behind the wheel of the car; with this photograph she began to be associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Harborg completed her 2012 project "Visions of Strangers" with great success.
In it, the artist created portraits of unknown people with the help of judicial evidence such as cloves and chewing gum, extracting DNA from this rubbish and creating images of what these people might look like.
And then she got an email from Paper Magazine.
“They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted some portrait to illustrate the article,” Dewey-Hagborg explained at a preview of the new exhibition for the press.
At the time, Chelsea could not be visited and photographed, so they contacted her and asked if she would like to have a portrait made of her DNA.
In this unusual way, the artist and her prison muse became correspondence friends and exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even wrote a comic book entitled Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoaly Kanungo, which depicted how the president would ease Chelsea’s punishment in the future and be able to visit the exhibition in person.
The fact that Obama really decided to release Manning just a few days after the book came out was a pleasant surprise after seven tough years in a Kansas military prison.
There’s something profound and powerful about the exhibition opening right now as Donald Trump declares war on people revealing secret information in the government and invents new ways to inflame the enmity he’s meant to soften on Twitter.
When Dewey-Harborg was asked about the timing of all this, she said that "nothing happens by chance."
In a statement written on the gallery wall, Manning’s huge signature at the bottom (with a heart instead of a dot above the “i” in her name) calls for an end to “automatic separation based on gender, race, sexual orientation, and culture.”
On the opposite side is its mitochondrial DNA, a long caterpillar of C, G, and A.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, as the artist scientifically excels), Dewey-Harborg hoped to show how surprisingly similar we are, at least in our biological structure.
“I hope to explain to people that our genome does not determine what we are, how open genetic data is for interpretation, and how subjective it is,” said Dewey-Harborg; her 2007 video work, False Memories, is also featured here.
“DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of those stories are here.”
The last part of the exposition, which fits in one room, is the aforementioned novel in the comics.
On it, King Kong-style Manning appears above the U.S. Correctional Barracks building with a loudspeaker in his hand.
“If they kill your speech, they will win,” it says.
“Never be silent.”
“It’s a direct quote from the letter she wrote to me,” says the artist who greeted us from Philadelphia.
“I still have ants on my skin when I talk about it.”
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition in person — as it was visually depicted in the comics — but when it arrives, she will be greeted by masks in the center of the room, her own genome-like simulacrums gathering like crowds of protesters.
This was also done intentionally, like everything on the exhibition up to the height (5"2, Manning's height), on which the pencil was drawn genetic haplogroups.
“I used to hang them on the walls, but now I want them to look like a crowd of people,” Dewey-Harborg says of the portraits.
“I wanted them to be like the mass movement that formed around Chelsea, like the movement that was behind her liberation.”
University of the North-Western University and Oxford University staffer wanted by police on murder charge
According to police, there is a nationwide raid on professors at Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford, who are being searched as suspects in connection with the fact that in a luxurious room in Chicago was found a crowded dead man.
According to Cook County court records, on Monday, arrest warrants were issued for the premeditated murder without the right to release on bail of 42-year-old Vindham Latam and 56-year-old Andrew Coron Warren in connection with their alleged involvement in the death of Trent.
According to the documents, the twenty-six-year-old Cornell-Duranlo died after he suffered multiple stab wounds.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Department said the body was found on July 27.
The police received a call, they came to the Grand Plaza apartment complex and found the victim with several wounds on the body.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranlo was pronounced dead at the scene of the crime, and now detectives are investigating the death from knife wounds, considering her to be a murder, while police are scrambling to find two suspects.
Latam has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cabbage, vice president of communications at the university, said in an e-mail statement that Latam was on administrative leave and that he was barred from attending Northwestern university campuses.
“This is now a criminal case that is being investigated by law enforcement officials, and Northwestern University is cooperating with the investigation,” Kabbage said.
Warren is a senior financial officer at the University of Oxford.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in an e-mailed statement: “We have been in contact with the UK police and are ready to provide any necessary assistance to the US investigative bodies.”
The statement also said Warren’s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to give up.
The head of communications of the Chicago police department, Anthony Gullelmi, said he strongly advises the suspects to surrender to the authorities.
“The police have speculations about their whereabouts, but our attempts to find them are intensifying,” Gullelmi said.
According to Gullelmi, local, regional and federal authorities are assisting in the search for suspects.
According to Gullemmi, the Grand Plaza building administrator called the police, who had just received a mysterious message that something had happened in room 1008.
Police called the scene a horrific one.
Gullelmi said it was not clear whether the incident took place on July 27.
According to him, the video camera data confirms that Latam and Warren were in the building.
“We believe that Professor Latam and the victim were linked,” Gullelmi said.
The Grand Plaza management issued an address to the residents, in which it was reported: “At the moment the police are working on the chronology of the incident, collecting information about the victim and considering a number of motives, including a possible domestic incident.”
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "We will meet the requirements of the road map of WADA in the near future"
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that the conditions of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), set to resume the work of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA), will be fulfilled in the near future.
"A certain stage in the implementation of the requirements was passed, RUSADA was given the right to plan and conduct tests together with UKAD (the UK anti-doping agency).
The road map of WADA has been updated accordingly," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of WADA’s road map on the restoration of compliance with the Code, which lists the conditions for the resumption of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization’s website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could present difficulties for Russia.
“Everything has been announced, everything will be done.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future,” he added.
However, one of the requirements included in the list implies that Russian andidoping structures must publicly acknowledge the results of the WADA-ordered investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, which claimed that doping in Russian sports is controlled by the state.
Speaking on the matter, Mutko said: “We are investigating because our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no state programs, and we will not recognize what was not.”
Mutko repeated the words of Vitaliy Smirnov, head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
On the morning of the same day, in an interview with the Russian edition of Rsport, Smirnov acknowledged the problems that had previously occurred in Russian anti-doping structures, but added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and provisions.
Undoubtedly, no one is going to accept this report," Smirnov added.
WADA suspended RUSADA from conducting doping control in November 2015 following a doping scandal.
However, in June of this year, he was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
Following a visit to the organization’s Moscow office in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli said that RUSADA was “going in the right direction” to restore its work.
A fire broke out in a 79-story tower in Dubai
A major fire that occurred in one of the world’s tallest residential buildings, The Torch Tower, has been extinguished, Reuters reports.
It is noted that the firefighters managed to cope with all fires by 4.00 local time (3.00 MSK).
Local authorities said no one was injured as a result of the incident.
At the time of the extinguishing of the fire, the streets adjacent to the skyscraper were closed.
The cause of what happened is not yet known.
Earlier it was reported that the 79-story residential skyscraper The Torch is burning in Dubai, which is one of the tallest buildings in the world.
All residents were evacuated on time.
Unimaginable outfit Boob shake fans: pants that do not cover panties
The scandalous leading reality show "Dom-2" Olga Buzova struck the audience of the Europa Plus Live festival with dances in panties.
In the eyes of thousands of fans, the newly appeared singer duo with Nasty Kudry performed the song "We will be hot".
Both girls took to the stage in provocative "breeches", sewn in such a way that the underwear of the singers was visible.
On the trousers were made inscriptions Buzova and Kudry.
Earlier, it was reported that changes in the appearance of Buzova commented a specialist of one of the Moscow clinics of plastic surgery.
Stoltenberg acknowledged the deterioration of relations between NATO and Russia
This was reported on Friday, August 4, the Radio 4 news service, citing foreign media.
According to him, it is the Russian authorities who are responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, NATO Secretary General also criticized Russia for the situation with Crimea and "destabilization in eastern Ukraine".
At the same time, Stoltenberg assured that dialogue with Russia is nevertheless possible, and further escalation of the situation will not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier on Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump said U.S.-Russian relations were at a dangerously low level, and accused the U.S. Congress of doing so.
Yekaterinburg Metro learns a new method of payment
In October, the passage in the Yekaterinburg metro can be paid with a bank card, said Pavel Vedernikov, CEO of I-Net, in an interview with the Regional Gazette.
Our goal is to introduce to the 2018 World Cup the same payment system for subway travel as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Novosibirsk.
“We want fans from other countries, guests of the World Cup, to be able to use the metro with their bank cards, without acquiring tokens or standing in line,” he said.
Startups that will help your company not become another “Uber”
Amy Errett wanted to assess the level of satisfaction among employees of her startup in the field of e-commerce, but the surveys did not work.
The answers were often vague, pointless, or, worse, insincere.
And even though she promised anonymity, some employees did not trust the process.
“It’s never been consistent and objective,” said Errett, who manages San Francisco-based 75-person Madison Reed, a hair care e-commerce firm.
Therefore, she appealed to third parties for help.
Now, a new type of startups in the field of personnel work is emerging that help companies find out how their employees feel.
By designing and licensing software designed to measure employee engagement, they allow companies to do express surveys, address specific teams and demographics, offer employees anonymity and hotlines for complaints, and in some cases allow informants to go to the top.
“We now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for health monitoring, but where is Fitbit for your company?” says Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of Redwood City startup Glint, whose analytics programs are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she had achieved a greater understanding of what her employees were thinking and feeling during the three years of using Glent.
In addition to express surveys and surveys of certain teams, the product offers a heat map of the company and shows in a visual form, which units have more complaints and which managers have a low approval rating, which allows it to understand why.
The companies are becoming more and more aware that they need to control the situation in the workplace, otherwise they will become another Uber, who was involved in a scandal when a former employee posted a blog post describing an aggressive environment in which those who expressed dissatisfaction, the order.
For startups like Glint, this desire to control the situation is an opportunity for a profitable business.
According to estimates from the Internet portal “Let’s Talk About Payment”, dedicated to financial technologies, the global governance, regulation and compliance industry could cost more than $118.7 billion by 2020.
Convercent, a startup in Denver, Colorado, that helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, noted a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year amid the decline in Uber’s reputation.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.
Recently, Uber appeared among customers.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send custom-made surveys of staff opinions, collect confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps of problem areas.
It also provides a hotline for anonymous text messages that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the top manager is affected, the complaints go directly to the directorate.
“The court of public opinion has seized power from inspectors,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Convercent.
If it turns out that the company mistreats employees or behaves unethically, even if the inspector does not intervene, the company may face costly consequences in the form of boycotts by customers, outflows of employees and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, a network of restaurants with more than 25,000 employees at 500 locations, has used Convercent for over a year to ensure employees are aware of the rules and procedures and to offer an easy way to contact the company’s head office.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to look for the phone number or email of the head office, file an official complaint, and hope that it would be taken seriously.
It was often a frightening and embarrassing experience, said James Vitrano, head of law at Ruby Tuesday, who said there was no normal way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company uses the Convercent service, problems that were previously hidden from managers sitting in offices in other cities or states — such as discrimination, harassment, and unfair pay — can be found and dealt with more quickly.
“I can get closer to a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the situation of employees,” said Vitrano, who heads the Ruby Tuesday network’s risk management team.
“And we are protecting our shareholders from litigation with employees.”
According to Quinland, companies began to take employees’ ethics, values and involvement more seriously in 2002, after Arthur Andersen’s accounting firm collapsed due to ethical violations as a result of the Enron case.
But it wasn’t until “social media got widespread,” that companies realized they couldn’t keep their dirty linens from spreading virally online.
“Before using technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both “Glint” and “Convercent” offer their software as a service, charging companies a regular fee for using their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity that has received the approval of venture investors who have supported both startups.
In February, Convercent received $10 million in funding from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing the company’s total capital to $47 million.
Glent received $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing the company's total capital to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising if you take into account the interconnected nature of companies, culture, and venture capital.
A growing body of research shows that today’s employees expect more from their jobs than they did before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects, this is just the necessary minimum.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated, and that they dedicate their time to the company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy to work for a company, feel that they are heard, and that the work they do brings results, they are more trying to make such a company successful,” says Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee satisfaction at LinkedIn.
Investors make a profit when business with companies from their portfolio goes well; business with companies goes well when employees are committed and involved.
If third-party analytical tools promise to increase employee loyalty and engagement, it is not surprising that they find support.
According to experts on culture in the workplace, it is important to have data on employee involvement.
But the data is useless until the company’s custodians take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for feedback, it can create the impression that changes are coming.
And if the changes don’t come quickly enough, or don’t come at all, disappointment can develop, and employees will lose interest.
“If you’re going to ask for 4,000 offers, you should be prepared to have 4,000 conversations,” says Russell Rath, president of consulting at Kotter International, which had to see companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection.
“Because if you don’t go to the end, the staff will wonder, ‘Did you really hear me?
Don't you care?
If you don’t care, why shouldn’t I care?”
According to Errett, Madison Reed, which now conducts monthly employee surveys, is able to take action on the same day that someone reports a problem with the help of Glint.
And, after collecting feedback from employees, dissatisfied with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to solve the problems.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new knowledge about its employees and hopes that in the long term, this knowledge will help it to retain employees more effectively in an industry known for its high staff fluency.
“If you don’t try to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people,” Vitrano said.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies.
In Barnaul opened a new asphalt on the avenue of the Red Army
In Barnaul, cardinal measures were taken to eliminate the cause of asphalt failures on Krasnoarmeyskiy Avenue.
The place where the pits on the newly asphalted road (the intersection with Molodezhnaya Street) appeared twice, it was decided to "open up".
Recall that the collapse of a small section of the road near the tramways occurred due to the fact that the land settled in the area of the unmanaged unexploited network.
According to Ivan Garmat, Deputy Chairman of the City Committee on Road Management, Improvement, Transport and Communications, a detailed survey will be conducted to investigate and eliminate the prerequisites for the collapse.
Depending on its results, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is assumed that it will be necessary to restore the formwork of inhospitable communications and their concreting.
This is reported on the official website of the regional capital.
The Bruins team has to do longer due to the fact that the National Student Sports Association has canceled training twice a day
Time approaches eleven o’clock in the evening; a crowd of footballers from the University of California, Los Angeles, are delayed to chat on one side of the team’s new training fields located on campus.
Some of them tore their shirts, bare their backs shimmering from sweat after a tense first day at a sports camp.
For many players of the team, these minutes of idleness constitute a break in the middle of the day.
Players enrolled in the summer classes, after the three-hour training, will go back to the dormitories to prepare for the final exams, and the next morning will return to the Waterman football center for meetings at 6:30.
Shortly before Monday turned into Tuesday, Bruins coach Jim Mora said, “For the next three days these guys are waiting for a meat grinder.”
The fact that the National Student Sports Association canceled training twice a day, which was devised to reduce the load on players, actually lengthened their working day – at least until the exams were completed on Friday.
Therefore, the start of the first three training sessions of the team at the University of California, Los Angeles, was scheduled at 7:15 p.m. to fit into the already tight schedule of players.
A side effect of the lack of two workouts a day has been a greater number of days with one workout, and Bruins moves the start of the camp almost a week compared to last year and conducts training during the summer school for the first time in six seasons of Mora in Westwood.
According to the schedule, they will have to conduct 18 training sessions by August 20 inclusive, before starting official preparations for the first game of the season against the team of Texas University A&M in September.
Mora said he supported a change in the rules by the National Student Sports Association, despite the fact that he made another point in the tight schedule of players.
“For three or four days we’re giving them this huge load, it’s a serious test,” Mora said.
“And they just overcame it, they work, they’re great guys.
I think when we live until Saturday and we have more time, it’s going to be really great.”
When the camp is over, the University of California, Los Angeles, will do the training indoors; this is not an easy task, as its fields are in direct view from the adjacent parking lot and from the neighboring Laskin Center, an expensive hotel that has already been bombarded with football defenses.
Players from the Bruins are expected to occupy the hotel starting this weekend, but Mora admits that when rooms are free during the season, there may be a problem.
“We will have security,” Mora said.
“This is a serious problem, and I’m not exaggerating the danger, assuming that someone can take a room, sit there and record a workout on video.
If you have a training video, it’s very serious.
But we'll have security there, and there'll be security in parking lot number 8.
We will do everything we can with what we have.
I won't worry too much about it.
We have a plan.”
All victims of the terrorist attack in St. Petersburg have been discharged from hospitals
All the victims of the terrorist attack on the St. Petersburg metro in April have been discharged from hospitals.
This was reported in the press service of the Deputy Governor Anna Mityana.
According to data at the end of July, three people remained in hospitals, TV Center reports.
Recall that the explosion in the metro of St. Petersburg occurred on April 3 of this year.
The bomb was detonated by terrorist-killer Akbarjon Jalilov.
As a result of the attack, 15 people were killed, as well as the perpetrator himself.
In the criminal case, 11 people, including the alleged organizer Abror Asimov, were arrested.
The day before, Rospotrebnadzor recommended the St. Petersburg metro to revise the plan of measures to ensure transport safety, in particular by increasing the number of metal detector frames.
Facebook strengthens fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook will be more likely to send texts suspicious of mystification to independent experts and show their findings in original posts, the world’s largest social network said on Thursday, which is trying to fight so-called fake news.
In a statement on its website, the company said it is beginning to use improved machine learning algorithms to recognize possible falsifications, send them for verification, and possibly display fact-checking results under the source post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main ways of spreading so-called fake news, which many believe had an impact on the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The issue is also being actively debated in Europe after French voters were misled by false messages ahead of the presidential election in May, and in Germany before the September elections said they supported a plan to fine social networks if they did not promptly remove posts.
In a separate statement in German on Thursday, Facebook said it was testing a new fact-checking algorithm that was launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to seeing what messages are being challenged by independent reviewers, people want to have a broader context to make informed judgments about what they read and what they share,” Sarah Sue, Facebook’s newsfeed manager, wrote in a blog post.
She added that Facebook will continue to test the “related articles” feature and work on other newsfeed changes to address the fake news issue.
Create a novel-comics: One castle in English history
In the recent past, Scotty's tiny castle was filmed in the music video "Squeeze", and in the 70s and 80s served as a harbor for Margaret Thatcher.
But 700 years from his cosy place in the valley of the Bull River in Kent County, he watched the turbulent story around, and now he inspired Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshire man with land-haired and prone to historical documents, to a novel-comic.
“I think it’s so beautiful to look at the handwriting of a man who died 300 years ago,” he said.
“You feel so personal when you hold this letter in your hand.”
"Castle in England" covers the period from the Middle Ages to the Evardian era and tells the story of the families who lived in Scotty; each story is illustrated by one of the young British artists - Isaac Lenkevich, Bryan May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Izmer.
This is not the first book by Rhodes that is based on archival data: in 2014, he wrote Dead Man’s Teeth and Other Stories, a collection of British Library materials; this project unexpectedly touched him to the core.
“I could have been touched by a fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working for the Jacobites,” he said.
"It's his fingerprint."
And the letters always smell of smoke, because in those times the fire was lit for lighting.
And in 300 years, in the future, you feel like you’re there too.
I love the archives!"
For a person with such a passion for old papers, getting support from the National Foundation and the English Arts Council and living in the castle for four months ("Honestly, I've had a bit of a stay there") seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent all day studying the "new" Victorian castle, going through the archives and looking at numerous treasures of the estate and ancient things - for example, the heads of hyenas on the walls or bottles that had been in the trenches for centuries.
He walked through the park and the ruins of the old castle, talking to woodworkers, gardeners, and sometimes artists who worked on illustrations for his book.
Then at night he "drank whiskey and sat down to write."
The history of Scotty’s castle has not been fully explored because the National Fund only gained full access to it in 2006, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hassi, died.
When Rods arrived there ten years later, the staff were only beginning to deal with the archive, which he describes as "what aristocrats have been putting on the loft for centuries."
Diaries, letters from the time of the British Empire, maps showing who owned what: "You think land disputes are boring," says Rhodes, "but there were two families fighting over this birch.
That's what happens, guys!"
In some stories of the collection, the castle becomes the starting point for wider explorations in English history: for example, in The Worker, the hero leaves the newly built castle to join the Peasant Revolution of 1381.
“There is information about the rebellion that occurred in the castle in 1380, in a book called ‘Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex,’” says Rods.
“The peasant uprising started in these places, and I thought the uprising was a good start.
“Maybe they were connected?”
Other plots are closely related to the history of the castle - for example, "The Priest", which tells about a Jesuit priest, whom the Darrell family hid in his house for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or “The Smuggler,” about the 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who is believed to have staged his own funeral by filling the tomb with stones (this was discovered a few years later when the tomb was dug).
Darrell is Rods' favorite family of all who inhabited Scotty: "The gentlemen seem to have been a perfect swindler, forever getting into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
In different generations, the Darrell men have solved their debt problems by marrying rich older women — I imagine them as the company of nice guys who know how to care for the heirs of great fortunes.
After finishing work at the castle, Rhodes is looking for other opportunities to gain a unique writing experience.
He lived for two weeks in the Finnish dugout, where he wrote a graphic novel about Elyamyanmyaki - a place where at the beginning of the 20th century there was a sanatorium, and then it again grew into a forest.
But Scotty remains a special place for him.
“I was sad to leave,” he says.
“I felt like this: Damn it, I have to go back to real life again.”
Fifteen of the Biggest Banks Choose “Russia”
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is developing: following Sberbank, VTB, VTB-24, Alfa-Bank, Gazprombank, Rosselkhozbank, Binbank and FC Otkritie, seven other credit organizations are going to leave this public organization.
Thus, at least 80 per cent of the market will be accounted for by the outgoing ARB organizations.
But this is not just a way out - all the banks that have declared a break with the ARB are negotiating with another public organization uniting credit institutions - the Association of regional banks "Russia", which is headed by the well-known politician Anatoly Aksakov, the chairman of the State Duma Committee on the financial market, recognized
The beginning of the conflict within the ARB was laid during the discussion in the Federation Council, when the Interregional Banking Council considered new bills, in particular, involving a new classification of banks according to the size of the authorized capital.
Then Garegin Tosunyan, the president of the ARB, said that, in the opinion of the association, this bill is adopted in the interest of the largest banks, which are thus trying to limit the possibilities of small and medium-sized banks in the regions, intercepting their clientele.
Among other claims, there was criticism of the Central Bank, which, according to Tosunyan, does not always justify withdrawing licenses from some banks, which, however, was followed by an objection from the representative of the Central Bank: many managers of the sanctioned banks, in particular, Vneshprombank, entered
Apparently, this exchange of mutually exclusive opinions in a very sensitive to the relationship with the main regulator of the banking environment and became a visible reason for the fifteen largest banks, having declared disagreement with the policy of the ARB, began to prepare for the accession to the association "Russia", noting that "the
Investors will be better.
What's the end of the case?
Let us answer immediately the main question that arises in the case of the slightest failure or conflict in or near the banking sector: investors are not threatened, rather, on the contrary, the reliability of the banking system will increase.
Heads of "Russia" Anatoliy Aksakov, known for his versatility in everything regarding the interests of banks and their clients, a high-level professional who is highly appreciated in the Central Bank: almost all the management of the Central Bank is present at the annual events of the Association, and all the significant legislative initiatives of the regulation.
In terms of personnel and organization, it is obvious that there are also no special shocks.
Undoubtedly, the ARB finds itself in a difficult financial and management situation after losing such powerful and influential participants with their contributions and lobbying capabilities.
However, in this oldest organization, which was established in 1991, there is considerable potential to continue to improve banking legislation and the field of money-lending in general.
It can not be said that in the association "Russia" with open arms are ready to accept on any conditions new members, judging by the reaction of its leader, Anatoly Aksakov ("may want too much"), who on July 21 at the briefing in the press center of the Parliamentary Gazette, said to be able to follow the results of the Bank of Ukraine.
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of bankers in the Association Council, as well as to pay more attention to new banking technologies.
The negotiation process is underway, the proposals of both sides are being studied, the agenda of the extraordinary congress of the association is being prepared, which will be held in Sochi in mid-September as part of the international banking forum.
That's where we'll decide.
Also, Anatoly Aksakov, stressing that "not holding the chair", called possible new head of the renewed association "Russia" Georgiy Luntovsky, who leaves in September the post of Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank, highly characterizing his business.
On August 18, Anatoly Aksakov, who is now resting in Crimea, plans to interrupt the holiday for one day and arrive in Moscow, at an extraordinary meeting of the Council of the Association "Russia", where it is planned to consider the agenda of the extraordinary congress of "Russia".
The entry of gasoline-powered cars into major cities of Russia will not be limited
Deputy head of the Ministry of Transport Nikolai Asaul said that, contrary to media reports, the entry of gasoline-powered cars into major cities of Russia will not be limited yet.
This is a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is that we need to gradually increase the environmental class.
And then there is the concept of going straight to zero emissions.
I don't think we're technically ready for that.
The question is, from what year?
This is the same phrase at the level of slogans - let's ban it.
Where and when?
- Tomorrow?
Shutting down the whole town?
“Twenty years from now, I don’t know, maybe it will happen,” Prime said.
Earlier, the newspaper "Izvestia" reported that by August 17, Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich was instructed to study proposals on possible options for state support of electric transport, presented to the government by General Director of PJSC KamAZ Sergei Kogogin.
Among the proposals, according to the newspaper, is the use of cars with air traffic control in large cities and resorts.
Washington is changing the rules of getting a green card.
According to the media, President Donald Trump said that a new U.S. immigration plan will be adopted, according to which the rules for obtaining a green card will change.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on obtaining family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the President.
The bill will be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and it will do so at the expense of changing how the U.S. issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process will provide benefits to candidates who speak English, have the money resources that allow them to support themselves, and have the skills that will benefit our economy,” Trump said.
The appearance of sex robots is real, and it should bother us
We did not have time to think that 2017 could no longer be worse, a new report on technological progress in the production of sex robots has been released.
Oh, yeah.
Sex robots are in the spotlight now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently released a report on the development of sex robots in the next 5-10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, a distinguished professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must take their emergence seriously.
Users will be able to choose the eye color of the robots, the shape of the nipples and the type of nails.
“People are humming about it, but firms are already sending them to consumers in large numbers, and we will soon see much more of them,” Sharkey said at the presentation of the new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable counterparts into robots with silicone-skinned, warm-to-the-touch, and almost human-like replicas controlled by artificial intelligence.
Users can also “tune” their robots to their taste, choosing everything from the eye color and the shape of the robot nipples to the shape and color of the nails.
But the fact that many robots have a “personality” compared to which Stepford’s Wife would seem very progressive is even more troubling.
Modern sex dolls have become robots with silicone skin.
For example, the company "RealBotix robot" allows users to adjust the quality of robots that they find attractive - for example, shyness.
There are also Roxxxy Gold sex robots, developed by "True Companion", which come with an already programmed personality - for example, "Cold Farra" gives the impression of shy, and "Wild Wendy" has a "brave" character.
“Roxxxy Gold has a character that’s perfect for yours,” the True Companion website said.
So she loves what she loves you, doesn’t like what you don’t love, and so on.
She changes her mood during the day, like a real person!
She may want to sleep or talk, or she may “be in the mood”!”
In the emergence of sex robots, there is much to worry about – not least because they replace real human relationships – but the most worrying is the submissive image of a woman, an association with rape, which causes the seizure of the Cold (read: resisting).
On the site "True Companion" Roxxxy is compared to a vibrator, only for men.
"If a woman (sic!) can have a vibrator, why can't men have Roxxxy?"
But these sex robots are not just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing complexity points to something darker and deeper in our culture, a departure from the ideal of gender equality towards the desire for sex with subordination as an optional supplement.
Most men will certainly not buy sex robots, and although the FRR notes their growing popularity, they remain on the periphery of consumer culture for now.
But what comes to us from the periphery can be very instructive with regard to the meanings of the epoch in which we live.
And many people are not stupid or aggressive until the free market gives them the opportunity to do so.
It’s no coincidence that these complex sex robots came about precisely when women’s rights were threatened all over the world, when there’s a president in the White House who brags about being attracted to women.
The scariest thing in the TV series "The Tale of the Maid" - not graphic images, twisted bodies and squeezed eyes, namely, how realistic this vision seems.
The Republic of Gilead is an exaggeration, but now it does not seem that big.
The goal of the sex robot industry is to achieve such physical resemblance to real women (only with the proportions of porn stars) that technology allows.
Their creators want them to appear human to the touch, to copy the movements of the human body.
But it is precisely their "characters" that robots do not resemble real women.
They cannot break up with their partners or leave them.
They have neither a life nor a biography—nothing that could point to independence or anything else that could destroy the illusion of total dependence.
In other words, they are beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, servants.
The Los Angeles native Eugene (Puch) Jeter, who has been playing for the Ukrainian national team since 2013, will not help our national team at the European Basketball Championship, the final part of which starts on August 31.
This was reported in an interview with BeBasket portal by the general manager of "blue-yellow" Andrey Lebedev.
We tried to make a deal with Jeter, but unfortunately, he won't be coming for family reasons.
We will go to EuroBasket without a naturalized player because we don’t want to take someone we don’t know.
“This situation will provide opportunities for the development of our young players,” he said.
Recall: with the direct participation of Jeter, the Ukrainian national team took a record sixth place at the Eurobasket-2013 and for the first time got to the World Cup in basketball, in which "yellow-blue" could not overcome the group stage, and the native of the United States scored an average of 5 goals, 4 for 15 games.
Jeter has stopped playing for the Ukrainian national team since Mike Fratello, the head coach of our national team, left that position in 2015.
The men’s EuroBasket 2017 will be held simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will hold their group tournament matches on the promised land.
Evgeny Murzin will have five matches in Group B: Germany (August 31), Italy (2 September), Georgia (3rd), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
As part of the preparation for the tournament, our men's team held two control matches, in which they conceded to the Dutch and Belarusians.
Trump's great feat?
Imagining Mitt Romney seems to be very reasonable.
In the Trump era, the common place became the fact that the political disputes that polarized the American electorate, at the micro level, broke some families.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, American newspapers spawned columns on how to deal with terrible relatives voting for Trump.
Looks like we're all so tense that we're about to burst.
Less is said about Trump’s ability to connect families.
I write about it because my cousin, a left-wing poetess from Chicago who has long been on the knife with Republicans in her family, came to me in New York this week.
She reminded me that uniting in the fight against a common enemy can have a strong effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican brother she’s been arguing with about politics for decades, suddenly and strangely found themselves on the same side.
At dinner it is undoubtedly good; but I cannot help but think that in a broader context it can be quite dangerous.
Trump has breathed his strength into the left flank, but the deforming effect of his rule could move us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and “normalization,” we mean the improbable possibility that one day we will no longer be struck by his outbursts.
There is, however, an even more questionable scenario in which Trump “normalizes” the most right-wing Republicans, who, against his standards, will suddenly turn out to be a model of common sense.
I caught myself missing out on the old-fashioned madness of Mitt Romney today—with a dog on the roof of a car and a 14 percent income tax (but we at least knew what his tax return looked like)—compared to Trump and that and the other seems like a very small deal.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate will simply be in his mind to see a huge step forward.
When my cousin went downtown, we went with the kids to a carousel in Central Park – the largest carousel in the New York City Parks Department’s economy and the best way in the city to spend three dollars if you don’t need caffeine.
Horses are ugly and huge, images of fiberglass on the central drum - make-up clowns and animals, who, bending, in horror look at themselves on the back - extremely sinister, and the ringing music, strange as it is, leads to delight.
So many famous things in this city disappoint: the views from the skyscrapers are obsolete, the silhouettes of the buildings are too crowded to cause trepidation, and the reality of the city does not have time to dream.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I am still experiencing the day when I learned that the Swiss cottage district is not really a Swiss chalet (the themed pub "Ye Olde Swiss Cottage" is not included), but a large circular crossroads in North London.
And the carousel in Central Park is still an unusual, magical place where a child of two, a child of eleven and two women in forty can have a great time.
If I could put a carousel rating, I would put a five, but fortunately, no one asked me for it.
And in the department store this week, I was asked to evaluate my "experience" of shopping on a scale of one to five stars before spending a card on the terminal.
In the coffee shop on the corner of my street, the same plus the option to accompany the evaluation of 15 percent tea is for order at the stand.
As a result, not only does the idea-neutral interaction slow down, but you also have to put a personal attitude to a situation that does not imply it.
The poor shopkeeper in the department store smiled confoundedly as I was tired of appreciating my experience of handing her a five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital due to chest pain
Pistorius leaves the prison for a second visit to the doctor.
Last year, he was transferred to a hospital for the treatment of cuts on his wrists, which, according to the prison administration, he received as a result of a fall in a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of manslaughter after the prosecutor's office appealed the initial sentence for manslaughter.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning of Valentine's Day in 2013 by shooting her several times through the door of a toilet at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius said he took his girlfriend for a night thief hiding in his toilet.
The prosecutor’s office has said it intends to file another protest, this time against Pretorius’s six-year term, which she says is too mild.
The Attorney General's Office has said it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal will be considered this year.
The term of the Pretoria may be extended by 15 years if the prosecutor's office succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
Suspected in beating journalist NTV elected subscription on non-departure
Metropolitan law enforcement officers chose a measure of restraint in the form of a subscription on non-departure for a man who attacked the journalist of NTV Nikita Razvozhaeva during a live broadcast from Gorky Park on August 2.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the official representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation Irina Volk.
"As part of the investigation of a criminal case brought under Article 116 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation ("Beatings") against a 32-year-old man who hit the face of a correspondent of one of the TV channels in the Central Park of culture and recreation named after Gorky, the suspect has been selected for a measure of interception in the form of a signature.
The representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs added that an administrative protocol for police disobedience had been drawn up in respect of the suspect.
On Wednesday, August 2, during a live broadcast on the Day of the Air Force, a drunken man approached the correspondent and punched him in the face.
As it turned out later, the hooligan has nothing to do with the air force.
According to Razvozhaev himself, the paratroopers, on the contrary, tried to arrest the Muscovite.
Two Bulgarian Citizens Arrested in Greece for Illegal Tent Parking
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Bulgarian citizens have been detained in Greece for illegal tent parking, according to the BBC.
On the morning of August 1, a group of people were detained in Sithonia, who had set up tents in the wrong place, including two Bulgarian citizens.
They were released on the same day, while the investigation is still underway.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the TV channel “Bi-Ti-Vi” that the citizens of Bulgaria were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camping and are already imposing severe fines on anyone caught while parking in an unintended location.
The checks will be carried out throughout the season.
According to the ministry, the court can impose a fine.
Russian Foreign Ministry accuses U.S. Vice President of Cold War rhetoric
Statements made during the European tour of US Vice President Michael Pence were criticized by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
“It is regrettable to note that Washington is increasingly reeling into the primitive ideologized stamps of the Cold War times, which are completely detached from reality,” the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement.
In this way, the Foreign Ministry reacted to Penz's words about the "Russian threat" and attempts to forcefully cross the borders, which he said in Podgorica.
The Russian Foreign Ministry pointed to the destructiveness of the choice “either with the West or with Russia” and the vagueness of the thesis about the supposedly non-alternative accession of all South-Eastern Europe to NATO.
Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the United States that violated international law by using force to reject Kosovo from Serbia and thus created another focal point of tension.
“We call on American colleagues to stop shelling Russia and its foreign policy line, which is invariably based on respect for partners and willingness to work together constructively, on mutual consideration of interests,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Feldsher was injured in an accident with an "emergency" in Moscow
The accident occurred in the suburb of Stepino, as a result of the collision of the foreign car with the ambulance, the fielder was injured.
Today around 08:10 MSK there was a collision of a Mitsubishi car with an ambulance in the city of Stupin of the Moscow region.
"As a result of the collision, the car "quickly" turned over," TASS said in a press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Moscow region.
At the scene of the accident, law enforcement officers work, the circumstances of what happened are found out.
In the Odessa region, a woman threw her newborn son on the construction site, wrapping it in a cellophane package.
On the evening of August 3, the Divisional Police Department received a report from a local resident that he had found a package with a baby in an unfinished private house.
"At the site of the incident, law enforcement officers and doctors who promptly took the child to a medical institution went out," the head of the National Police in Odessa said.
Doctors determined that the boy was born a few hours before his discovery, as evidenced by the presence of the umbilical cord.
During the priority operational and investigative activities, the identity of the mother was established - a 36-year-old local resident.
It was also found that the woman had three more minor children.
As noted in the chapter, in the field of view of law enforcement officers, the family had not previously fallen and was not on special account.
The circumstances and reasons that prompted the woman to do so are now being established by the police, after which a procedural decision will be taken.
The baby is now under the supervision of doctors.
As previously reported, in Nikolaev, a 21-year-old woman threw her premature child into the sewage pipe.
Grigory Leps: "I'm breaking into battle, although 55 - not 30"
One of the most successful artists of the Russian stage Grigory Leps will celebrate his 55th birthday on Sunday.
Before the celebration, the singer spoke with the reviewer "Izvestii".
I remember when you said "half-breed."
A special tent in the Luzhnykh, Gloria Gaynor sang for the nominee, a powerful salute over the Moscow River.
You must have pretended to want to spend your next five years.
Have the plans come true?
When it comes to the profession, it was a good time.
I worked a lot, traveled three times with tours all over the country, gave 120-130 concerts a year.
He has released two good albums.
Of course, I’m not the same person I was 20 years ago.
The biological clock is not fooled.
Singing the way I sang in my 30s is getting harder.
Still, I'm fighting, I don't want to stop.
And I'm with new people, I think I'm taking it to a different level.
You're recording a new album with them, the first in three years.
Yeah, work on it is underway.
Actually, we've already recorded everything in my studio, and now we're going to send it to Los Angeles.
It is called "Why are you so serious?" after the song of the same name, which was written with Timothy.
She's not quite ready yet, so we haven't put her anywhere yet.
We'll do it later when we take the clip on it.
And the album will be presented in November - to a series of my anniversary concerts in the Moscow "Crocus City Hall".
Your new record was hand-drawn by cool American drummer Chris Coleman.
Do you think you wanted to include him in your tour?
In my opinion, Coleman is one of the most outstanding drummers in the world today.
He came to my studio, recorded his parties.
I invited him to join my group, and Jeremy Colson (a well-known drummer involved in various projects. - "Izvestia") offered.
But for long-term work in Russia, they put forward, to put it mildly, excessive conditions.
The fees ranged from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>35,000 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>45,000 per month.
Then I thought that in the post-Soviet space I would find worthy musicians.
And I found a great drummer, Max Malyshev.
It is better to feed your own (laughs).
Sometimes I want to hang out with some of them, not for what.
For example, guitarist Fedor Dosumov is highly rated internationally.
Western music magazines write about him, he is invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Wye, listening to his play, said that "a new generation of guitarists, with a different performing technique, has come."
Your album is coming down in Los Angeles, American musicians are collaborating with you, but you still can't come to the U.S.?
Are you trying to lift this ban?
Honestly, I'm not doing anything right now.
There are a number of lawyers who deal with this issue.
As a musician, I am truly sorry that I can’t get to America.
I've said many times that I'm studying there.
The more you communicate with real professionals, the more useful it is.
We're not dumber than them, but we don't have that kind of experience, school.
In front of our performers of popular music for 70 years completely did not set the tasks that American musicians have always solved.
They strive for the highest quality sound.
I try to follow the same principles.
Now, for some reason, the UK has refused me entry for ten years.
But I will still submit my visa documents to the British Embassy every year so that I can be allowed to go there again, and most importantly, to work there.
The rest of Europe is good to me.
And in August, you're planning a concert in Monaco, not a custom-made one, but a poster, right?
Yes, there's a good sports hall in Monte Carlo, I've been there before.
Now they have been invited again, and, as far as I know, all tickets to the concert have already been sold out.
You're going to the Lima Vikule's Date, which starts on July 20th in Jurmala?
She invited me, and I, of course, responded.
Lyma is a wonderful singer and a wonderful woman, able to serve herself with beautiful vocals and even whispers.
After tours and jubilee concerts, as far as I know, you want to turn to the work of Vladimir Vysotsky.
You already have two albums with his songs in the discography.
When is the third coming out?
Probably next year, though.
But it will be done in a completely different way.
I want to record about 80-90 songs of Vysotsky in about the same feed as he did himself.
Just the voice and the guitar.
There's no other arrangement.
I will be accompanied by our famous musician Timur Vedernikov.
I will try to attract participation in the album and Alexander Yakovlevich Rosenbaum.
I talked to him about it, we have a good relationship, but he's a busy man, so let's see how it goes.
You and the songs of Boris Grebenshchikov gradually entered into your repertoire.
Why don't you write an album of his stuff?
Boris Borisovich is a great man and a great musician.
I crossed paths with him several times and asked: can I sing this or that song of his?
He replied, "Grigorius, I write songs so that they may be fulfilled."
Please, try it, sing.
It would be interesting to record such an album.
I do not have such a task yet, but in the future, in a year or two, if Boris Borisovich does not mind, I may make such a project.
Unless you're completely focused on your own production center.
I guess until you've realized its potential, you've signed contracts with all the artists you're interested in?
There are a number of performers I would like to have under my wing, but they are independent, successful people.
You mean Sergey Lazarev?
Sergej is a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I may not agree with his repertoire, but he is a professional and he has his own development strategy.
And in my center now there is Alexander Panayotov, whom I led in the Voice.
We made a deal with him and we're working.
In our pop music, such singers are rare.
It will be a pity if he does not reach the heights he deserves.
I'm trying to get him a repertoire, I'm taking the clips.
I hope for a good result.
I also try to promote other artists of my center: I buy them songs, I cry to poets, sometimes their tracks fall into the rotation of television and radio channels.
If they do not reach high altitudes, I will still bring our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
At the release, they will receive a recorded album, several clips.
And then, if they want, they can go their own way, and I will not insist that they return the money invested in them.
Although I would be happy if one of them would achieve commercial success and pay me the interest that we agreed on in the contract.
But if that doesn't happen, I'm not going to cover up oxygen for anyone.
Let everyone work, break through, prove, as I once proved.
If tomorrow you are offered to do a tour of Ukraine and guarantee entry into the country, will you go?
I'm still being invited there.
Mostly, it is about closed events.
As for the big tour...
I am a man of my own country, a Russian, in my own opinion, flew to Syria on the same plane that then crashed.
If tomorrow they say that you have to fly to some other point in the interest of the state, I will fly.
I don’t care what bloggers and other critics think of me.
I sincerely regret that we have such a situation with Ukraine.
Because I believe that we are one people and that we should be together.
I am sorry that this is unlikely to happen, at least in the near future.
In the past I have given 40-50 concerts in Ukraine for a year.
They met like nowhere else.
A very grateful audience.
And he collaborated with several Ukrainian artists: Ani Lorak, Sveta Loboda, Artem Loik...
There are a lot of gifted people in Ukraine, and it is truly a pity that now they cannot fully pour out their talent to a wide Russian audience.
Music should unite and entertain people.
I would love to invite some great Ukrainian performer to Russia, for example Slava Vakarchuk, and do a concert with him.
But at the moment, I think it's unlikely...
Andrey Okhlopkov transferred from the cosmodrome
As it became known "<0xD0><0x95>", the technical director of the cosmodrome Vostochny Andrey Okhlopkov began work in the State Space Scientific and Production Center (GKNPC) named after Khrunichev.
Previously, he was de facto engaged in the construction of the Eastern cosmodrome, but due to disagreements with the management of the Center for Operations of Ground and Space Infrastructure (CENCI), he was transferred to an enterprise in the Moscow Filia, where he will coordinate production.
Mr. Okhlopkov will not have a replacement: the post of technical director is likely to be abolished, and the functions are distributed among the CENKI units.
The fact that the technical director of the East and the deputy director general of CENCI for technological development Andrey Okhlopkov moved to work at the Khrunichev GKNPCC, "U" told the top managers of several space industry enterprises, as well as an employee of the government apparatus.
“He’s been working on his new position for several weeks,” the industry spokeswoman said.
It was not possible to get an operational comment from CENKI on Thursday, and Mr. Okhlopkov himself was not available for comments.
However, the information "U" has been officially confirmed in the GNCC.
He decided to move to the position of Director of Production Coordination, - stated at the enterprise. - Andrey Okhlopkov has fully fulfilled the task assigned to him to ensure the launch minimum for the first launch at the cosmodrome of the East.
Mr. Okhlopkov moved to work at the CENKI in 2013, having served behind the shoulders in space troops, in particular in Baikonur, and in Plesetsk - at the "northern" cosmodrome he held the position of first deputy commander in the rank of colonel.
In 2009, Andrey Okhlopkov became a criminal case figure.
The investigation accused him of bribery: allegedly, from his submission, regional merchants received government orders for recoils, but did not fulfill their obligations to clean the separate parts of the carrier missiles in the Arkhangelsk region and the Republic of Komi.
In 2012, the jury found him innocent.
The duties on technological development assigned to him at CENKI were extended to various projects, but the main of them was the construction of a cosmodrome in the Far East.
Oleg Ostapenko, then head of the Federal Space Agency, in an interview with E, said directly that the situation in the East "was critical as early as October 2013."
The fact is that a strategic mistake was made in the planning: the completion of the construction and the first launch of the Soyuz-2.1 carrier rocket were planned for the same time - the end of 2015.
In order to carry out the launch before the end of the year, it was decided to complete the construction half a year earlier and the deadlines were postponed from December to July 2015.
To speed up the process, the trick had to go: CENKI specialists began to carry out parallel installation of technological equipment on unfinished facilities.
The main supporter of this idea was Andrei Okhlopkov.
Despite the existing risks and the transfer that took place (instead of December 2015 the Soyuz only flew on April 28, 2016), this idea proved to be true, says the source of the "U" at the cosmodrome: "Otherwise we would not have made a single launch from the East, but would have been engaged in construction".
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who oversees the creation of the cosmodrome, jokingly called Andrey Okhlopkov his "cosmic Susanin", but it was he who almost always asked for information about the construction.
Mr. Okhlopkov remembered and straight: for example, in an interview with "U" he proposed to deprive the Federal Agency for Special Construction (Spetstroj) of the status of the only performer in the East and directly work with subcontractors: "Why should we lay all the eggs in one basket?"
This idea was supported by the government.
Since 2017, CENKI has assumed the responsibilities of a general contractor to complete construction and installation work on the start-up and technical complex by the planned launches in the fourth quarter.
According to "U", the reason for the transition of Mr. Okhlopkov to the new place of work were disagreements with the management of CENKI regarding the ways of completing the construction of structures and complexes of the cosmodrome, as well as the methods of work with subcontracting organizations.
“It was decided that this would be better for everyone,” says one of the top managers involved in the construction of the East.
An employee of the government apparatus, in turn, calls the decision strange: "He was one of the best specialists, it will not be easy to find an equivalent replacement for him."
According to "U", this will not be necessary: the post of technical director of the cosmodrome will be abolished, and its functions will be distributed among the units of CENKI.

In the future, students of children's music schools will be able to receive two specialties at the same time.
According to the Deputy Director of the Department of Science and Education of the Ministry of Culture, Sviatoslav Golubenko, it is possible to reread the students' repetitive disciplines for this purpose, and the issue of paying for the rest of the classes in the second specialty to be solved with the help of special grants, RIA Novosti reports.
"The Ministry of Culture has taken this issue under control, and together with the expert community we will develop a mechanism that will allow to master two specialties, but at the same time will not contradict the current legislation in the field of education," Golubenko said.
Last Friday, during Vladimir Putin's "Nedetsky talk" with the students of the Syrius Children's Center, student Maria Andreeva said that she was forced to pay for repeating subjects in the second specialty at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl said that she is studying violin and piano class and has prizes competitions in both directions.
The head of state recognized her issue as very relevant and promised to help.
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian man was detained on the wall on a skyscraper
In Mexico, 17-year-old Russian Cyril N., who climbed on the wall on the roof of a high-rise building, was detained, according to the portal El Universal.
The incident took place in the capital city of Mexico.
The young man, with the help of two unknown men, crossed the three-meter fence into the territory of the Nestle office building complex and climbed up one of its towers on his own.
At the same time, he did not use any special equipment, insurance and ropes.
A young man was arrested on the roof.
Officials from the Ministry of Public Security dropped him on the ground by helicopter.
He was then sent to the National Institute of Migration.
It is there to find out if the young man is legally in the country.
Meanwhile, a video of a young man climbing to the heights has become popular on the Web.
Users called the young man "spider-man."
As the media writes, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate can help alleviate CKD.
Red meat and chocolate are considered a nightmare for your digestive tract.
But recent research suggests the opposite: a diet rich in meat proteins and dairy products may help alleviate symptoms in those suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases.
This incurable disease, which affects about 1.3 million people in the US and 300,000 in the UK, leads to colic and bloating, chronic or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Usually, to alleviate symptoms, patients are advised to avoid meat and dairy products, but researchers from the University of Washington have found that the main amino acid of the protein tryptophan contributes to the production of immune cells that increase intestinal tolerance.
Lead researcher Dr. Marco Colonna explained that the immune cells in the intestines make sure that harmful microbes that come with food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of triggering the inflammatory process are balanced by cells that increase tolerance, protecting the body and at the same time not harming sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too much disturbed in the direction of inflammation, it can lead to inflammatory bowel diseases.
Experiments have shown that mice that have a certain bacterium in the intestine have increased cell tolerance.
And this bacterium needs tryptophan — one of the building blocks of protein — to trigger the appearance of these cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between one species of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri, which is part of a normal gut microbiome, and the development of a population of tolerance-enhancing cells.
The more tryptophan in the mice’s diet, the more of these immune cells they had.”
He suggested that the same would work in humans: the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan may contribute to a more tolerant and less prone to inflammation environment in the gut.
Postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganvas, studying a variety of tolerance-enhancing immune cells, found that one group of test mice had these cells, and another group, which belonged to the same line but was contained separately, did not have them.
She suggested that the difference could be caused by the gut microbiomes of mice—communities of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The DNA of the intestinal cells of mice was sequenced, and six types of bacteria were found present in mice that had immune cells but were absent in mice that did not.
Mice grown in a sterile environment that did not have a good microbiome and did not develop this type of immune cell, received L. reuteri, and the immune cells appeared in them.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in a liquid environment and then transferred small portions of the fluid — without bacteria — to underdeveloped immune cells secreted from mice.
Immune cells have been converted into tolerance-enhancing cells.
When the active ingredient was separated from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of the tryptophan processing, known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of mice, the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the level of tryptophan was halved, the number of cells also fell by twice.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explains that humans have the same tolerance-enhancing cells as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri contribute to cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but in people suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases, defects in the genes associated with tryptophan have been found.
She says, "Perhaps we need to strengthen the development of these cells, because the inflammatory processes on the inner surface of the intestines depend on these cells.
High levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri may potentially lead to an expansion of their population.”
According to Jose Mourinho, "Manchester United" hired "genius" in the face of Nemanja Matich
Manchester United hired a “genius” in the face of Nemanja Matic, Jose Mourinho says after the midfielder made his debut in a match against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The player, acquired for <0xC2><0xA3>40 million from Chelsea, started with a 2-1 win in Dublin in the last pre-season match of United before the match of the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Thursday and made an impression in the role of a midfielder.
However, as Matic did not participate in the pre-season tour of Chelsea in Asia, he was seriously lacking preparation for the game, and he only lasted 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinho, requires refinement before the start of the Premier League season.
“He needs time, but his experience, his mind, his genius in how he thinks — he thinks football,” Mourinho said.
“We’ll help him prepare sooner rather than later.”
Like Matic, his new teammates Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started the game at Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began to form his main line-up by the start of the next season.
The Independent newspaper reported this week that Mourinho wanted to hire three more players, but stressed that the club has already achieved fantastic results by hiring three of the four players he would like to hire in the first place.
“I am grateful to the club for winning three out of four,” he added.
“I’ll be even happier if they get me four out of four, but they’ve already done a lot of work for me.”
Former leaders of Lithuanian Social Democrats persuade them to stay in the ruling coalition
Former chairmen of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, former prime ministers Algirdas Butkjavi<0xC4><0x8D>ius and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as former speaker of the Sejm from the Social Democrats Cheslovas Yur<0xC5><0xA1>enas appealed to the one-partyers to stay in power.
As reported by the "Parliamentary Gazette", due to frictions with partners - the Union of Peasants and "Greens" - the Social Democratic Party initiated a discussion about whether to remain in the ruling coalition.
And here the three senior experienced comrades addressed to the one-party center with an open letter, in which, in particular, it says: "It is clear disappointment of comrades in the party with the results of elections, but the coalition with the "peasants" has created for us a policy of equality, even if not very easy, but still conditions for the further implementation of social goals.
In the opinion of the former leaders of the party, the discussion so far "has been dominated by an emotion-based expression of opinion without specific arguments."
The authors of the letter fear that their party’s reckless actions could lead Lithuania to political, economic and social instability.
Disabled Anton Mamaev has been fined
The Moscow court has softened the sentence of wheelchair user Anton Mamayev from four and a half years of imprisonment to a fine of 200,000 rubles.
Earlier, by the decision of the Timiryazevsky court, the convict was released from the SIZO.
At the same time, the Moscow court confirmed that the accused is a criminal, as he organized the theft and abduction of a scooter from a former special forces fighter.
The Moscow court by its decision softened the punishment of Anton Mamaev to 200,000 rubles. fine.
"Mamaev is the organizer of the robbery, which also forms the composition of the crime, and, accordingly, such a person should be brought to criminal liability," said Uliana Solopova, a spokesman for the Moscow court.
In this case, the court took into account the state of health of Mamaev, the actual circumstances of the case, the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the court applied Article 64 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, according to which a punishment below the lower limit can be imposed.
As for Mamaev’s assistant Vasily Serosthanov, the court did not establish circumstances that would be the basis for changing the category of severity of the sentence committed and changing the sentence.
Anton Mamaev himself said that he remained dissatisfied with the decision of the Moscow court.
I'm disappointed with the court's decision.
The only legitimate solution would be justification, intending to continue to fight for justice.
His lawyer Andrey Orlov did not rule out appealing the sentence in the Moscow Court of Cassation and the Supreme Court.
“We will use all the levers up to the European Court of Human Rights,” he told RIA Novosti.
Recall that 28-year-old Muscovite Anton Mamaev, suffering from spinal muscular atrophy, became a criminal case last fall.
The disabled person claims that he bought a scooter from a friend for 160,000 rubles to then sell.
However, the owners of the scooter, among which is a former fighter of the special forces, said that the disabled and his assistant Vasily Serosthanov took property from them, threatening to use violence.
On June 30, the Tymiryazevsky District Court of Moscow sentenced Vasily Serosthanov to three years in the colony, and Anton Mamayev to four and a half years in prison with punishment in the colony of the general regime (per Art. 2 of Art. 162 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
After the disabled person was placed in the SIZO, the case was joined by the Public Chamber, the Prosecutor General's Office, the Human Rights Commissioner under President Tatyana Moskalkova.
As a result, in mid-July, Anton Mamaev was released from the SIZO by the decision of the same Timiryazev court.
The defense, in turn, appealed the decision of the first instance in the Moscow court.
Onf will prepare a report on the environment for the president
The final “Forum of Action” of the All-Russian People’s Front (ONF) in 2017 will be devoted to environmental issues, a source at the ONF told Izvestia and confirmed the head of the executive committee of the movement, Alexey Anisimov.
According to him, according to the results of the forum, the "front fighters" plan to prepare a report to the president on the problems of the national ecology, as well as to propose a strategy for solving them.
Interlocutors of “Izvesti” in the ONF note that the report to the head of state will contain “deep analysis” on the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to Izvestia, the final forum of the ONF will be held in the autumn.
The exact date of its holding has not yet been determined - as a rule, it is adjusted to the schedule of the president, who is the leader of the movement and traditionally present at key events of the ONF.
The front held several interregional environmental conferences, one in two federal districts - in Rostov-on-Don, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The result will be a conference in the capital of the Republic of Buryatia Ulan-Ude.
On the basis of the proposals that were made and will be made at these events, we will also form systemic proposals for solving environmental problems, - told "Izvestia" interlocutor in the ONF.
The co-chair of the Central headquarters of the movement Olga Timofeeva, head of the Committee of the State Duma on ecology and environmental protection, said that the "front-line" will report to the head of state about the work carried out within the framework of the Year of ecology in Russia.
The final environmental forum and the ONF Action Forum are likely to be combined.
Over the year we have grown a powerful team of experts in the field of environmental problems, seen gaps in the legislation, stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All this will be included in the report that we are preparing for the president as the leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, the "frontline workers" also report on the work on priority projects of the NIF, - told "Izvestia" Olga Timofeeva.
According to her, a special representative of the head of state on environmental activities, ecology and transport Sergey Ivanov will be invited to the forum.
Previously, he participated in the work of the ONF Media Forum, which was held in St. Petersburg in April.
In a few months, the Year of Ecology will go down in history, and the most important thing to do today is to launch environmental mechanisms so that they work for many years.
So that these issues do not fall off the agenda, - added Olga Timofeeva.
Andrey Kolyadin, head of the Regional Policy Laboratory of the Expert Institute for Social Research (EISI), noted that by raising environmental issues, the ONF is acting in accordance with the presidential agenda.
They offered many things as experts at various forums, and these initiatives received the support of the president," Andrey Kolyadin told Izvestia.
He stressed that the economic potential of the environmental agenda could not be excluded to date, which could give the regions an additional impetus for development.
In the future, with the help of the ONF, the regions will be able to lobby not only the solution of their environmental problems, but also the development of ecotourism, - added the expert.
The relevance of environmental issues was demonstrated by a “straight line” with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the President was asked questions about the garbage dump in Balashikha (already closed) and about the coal dust in the port of the city of Nakhodka (a bill on the prohibition of open transfer of coal in settlements has already been drafted, one of the authors is Olga Timofeev).
Experts in the field of ecology believe that the legal basis for solving environmental problems in Russia as a whole has been created, the issue is in further law enforcement practice, as well as in the position of civil society.
It is necessary to clearly implement the decisions taken by the state, - believes the head of the charity fund "Ecology for all" Leonid Bochin.
HRC member, head of the non-governmental organization “Greenpis Russia” Sergey Tsyplenkov in a conversation with “Izvestia” stressed that for a successful solution of environmental problems requires a responsible approach of society and business, some legislative efforts are few.
As soon as society and business realize that solving environmental problems is a much more advantageous step in a strategic perspective, the situation will change, - said Sergey Tsyplenkov.
The expert stressed that it is necessary to reverse the trend that violation of environmental legislation is an economically profitable solution for business.
The British inventor used a microchip to get into the house and the car at the stroke of a hand
The British inventor became the first person in the country to have a microchip installed so that he could open the door of his home, enter the office, and even start the car with a simple swipe of his hand.
Thirty-three-year-old Stephen Northam has embodied a tiny chip between thumb and forefinger and now through his firm BioTek offers this service to firms and individuals who want to simplify their lives through technology.
He teamed up with Dr. Jeff Watson, an anesthesiologist-consultant from the Royal Hospital in Winchester, to ensure that the procedure was carried out in accordance with medical standards.
The technology is similar to a microchip that is implanted in cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Northam also replaces locks in homes and cars with chip-compatible locks at <0xC2><0xA3>300 per lock.
The married father of one child has already installed the technology in his home and in his car "BMW Z4", which starts when his hand is on the wheel.
Requisite for the White House cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
According to military records provided to TIME magazine, the White House’s decision last month to deploy a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event dedicated to American industrial production cost taxpayers as much as $24,000.
The white-green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as "Marine One" when the president is on board, became the central element of the July 17 White House event that showcased U.S. construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials have inspected technology products from all 50 states.
The helicopter, manufactured in Connecticut, was displayed next to a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a truck from Mississippi.
According to the records of the First Marine Corps Helicopter Squadron (HMX-1), the division in charge of the helicopter, the military administration of the White House ordered the presence of the helicopter in a private order, or "FRAGO", just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the "southern lawn".
“I just wanted you to make sure you were aware because this is an unusual, widely reported event,” HMX-1 commander wrote in an email to his chief, the first deputy chief of aviation of the Marine Corps, on the eve of the event.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive at the South Lawn at approximately 7 a.m. on July 17 to participate in the event scheduled for 3 p.m. of the day, and would remain there until the lawn would be cleared between 6 and 9 p.m. on the same day.
The letter adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew will be required for the return flight in accordance with the operating hours restrictions.
The first crew accompanied the helicopter during the event, and the unit's security personnel remained close to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
From the records obtained by the magazine "TIME", it was not clear whether the second crew was required in the end.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal officials from using state property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 has clarified whether the event is in conflict with the decree.
“Among other things, we asked if it was a violation of Hatch’s law, and we were told that it was not,” the commander wrote.
“You seem to have nowhere to go,” the deputy chief replied.
The “Made in America” event was declared by the White House as an official event and was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even the official events have political notes.
During the event, the President made efforts to promote the health reform that was being developed in the Senate at the time, and praised attempts to regulate government regulations.
The use of aircraft known as “Marine One” and “Air Force One” for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But asking them only in the interest of photo opportunity is unusual.
Trump had already become the subject of discussion in February, when the presidential plane drove in the background during his first pre-election rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account was flooded with reports of complaints about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessor.
“The White House is thrilled with the ‘Made in America’ show, which featured products from 50 states made by American workers from American materials,” White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsey Walters said in a statement.
HMX-1 crews often perform training flights around the Washington Agglomeration and on the South Lawn to train the transportation of the President of the United States to the White House with an accuracy of up to an inch.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 training landings at the White House.
According to one of the officials, the flight performed for the event “Made in America” was counted by the crew as the necessary training flights for a month.
The unit’s helicopters also flew 11 additional hours that day as part of “non-presidential support missions.”
According to the White House, the taxpayers did not pay for any of the other exhibits presented at the event.
A representative of the company "Sikorsky" said that the company did not participate in the organization of the demonstration of the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not take into account the budget for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
But according to the Department of Defense hourly rates for the 2017 fiscal year, the Department of Defense compensation rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per hour of flight.
The unit records that the time of the aircraft in the air was 30 minutes to each side from its airfield base at the Quantico Marine Base in Virginia.
The White House claims that the real cost of using a helicopter is much lower than that rate.
“Calculating the cost for taxpayers, based on an approximate rate of reimbursement, is completely wrong,” says Walters.
“These sample rates include staffing, service and many other irreversible costs that are included in the annual allocations.”
According to a study conducted in 2015 by REND Corporation, the reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but, indeed, take into account the cost of fuel, services and costs specified in the contract.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer spoke out in favor of using the helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to demonstrate this week the things done in America,” Spicer said.
And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they are contributing to national security, and that there are, I suppose, hundreds, if not thousands of people whose jobs depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, that we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly to create.
Therefore, it is, of course, entirely appropriate to pay attention to this.”
It was unclear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter while looking at the South Lawn during the event, but he was exactly sitting in the driver’s seat in a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed representatives of Sikorsky, jokingly with the press on the topic of his own fleet of products of the company.
“I know Sikorsky very well,” the president said.
Moscow will allocate grants for resuscitation offices of urban hospitals
Annual grants "Saving Life" will be allocated to resuscitations and intensive care units of capital hospitals.
Funds are made to encourage doctors and nurses.
The mayor of Moscow, Sergey Sobyanin, visited the Yudin City Clinical Hospital.
During the examination of the clinic, he handed a thank-you letter to the traumatologist-orthopedist Victor Protsko, under whose guidance the most complex operation on the reconstruction of the foot of a teenager was carried out.
Sergey Sobyanin also spoke about the decision to allocate annual resuscitations and intensive care units of urban clinics grants.
The funds will be used to support doctors and nurses.
According to the mayor of the capital, the Yudin clinical hospital is one of the largest in Moscow today.
In recent years, the clinic has received a new modern equipment, allowing its doctors to perform unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 on the basis of the Kolomna Rural Hospital.
Currently, the departments of the medical institution are designed to receive more than a thousand patients.
In addition to resuscitation and the hospital, there are day rooms here.
The hospital has a staff of 2,800.
The total area occupied by the medical clinic is 23.7 hectares.
In February of this year, the medical institution became a participant in a pilot project on the organization of short-term stay hospitals (SPC).
They are designed to carry out relatively small operations.
In the process of surgical interventions, advanced medical equipment is used, which allows to significantly reduce the rehabilitation time of patients.
After surgery, they spend only a few hours in the hospital.
In the first half of this year alone, 36,000 patients were provided with in-patient care at the Yudin Clinical Hospital.
The clinic’s medical staff performed 15,800 operations of varying degrees of complexity.
NBU reported the absence of buyers of the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank
In the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) reported the absence of applications for the purchase of the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank.
This is reported on Friday, August 4, TASS with reference to the representative of the press service of the NBU.
The NBU confirms that on August 3, 2017, a package of documents from the citizen of Belarus and Cyprus Viktor Prokopeni for the agreement of the indirect (through Paritybank) acquisition of 100 percent of the shares of Sberbank was withdrawn.
"Documents from other potential investors for the purchase of Sberbank shares in the NBU have not been received," the statement said.
On August 3, Belarusian businessman Viktor Prokopenya withdrew the application for the purchase of the subsidiary structure of Sberbank.
On July 28, it became known that the National Bank of Ukraine denied Russian businessmen Said Guceriev and Grigory Guselnikov the acquisition of the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank.
The regulator based its decision on the fact that businessmen did not provide the necessary documents to verify their compliance with the requirements of the legislation of Ukraine.
Sberbank reported the sale of its Ukrainian "daughter" to the consortium Norvik Banka and a private Belarusian company in March this year.
The majority shareholder of the consortium was Said Gutseriev, the son of the Russian businessman Mikhail Gutseriev.
Sanctions against the “daughters” of five Russian banks in Ukraine, including Sberbank, were imposed in mid-March.
During the year, they are forbidden to withdraw capital from the country in favor of parent organizations.

The third season of Narco will be released on September 1st.
Democracy in Afghanistan depends on the role of women in politics, the UN said.
Elections can only be representative if they involve all members of society, including women, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
According to Nicolas Haysom, the current head of the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, hundreds of women are running for provincial council elections, three women are fighting for the post of vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
“The role of women cannot be overestimated,” he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be fully representative if women are fully involved and involved in all stages of the electoral process.
Elections to provincial councils and presidential elections will be held in Afghanistan on April 5.
The Taliban movement threatens to disrupt the election process, which coincides with the transition of international forces from combat operations to the role of advisers.
In this year’s elections, power is shifting peacefully from one democratically elected government to another for the first time.
Hayes said that increasing the role of women would contribute to the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Independent Electoral Commission of Afghanistan, out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.

In Venice tightened fines for tourists for inappropriate behavior
The Venetian authorities have tightened the fines for swimming in the canals from 50 euros to 500 euros.
For walks around the city in a swimsuit or with a naked torso will now be fined 200 euros.
For 100 euros will be required from those who will have a picnic in a public place or ride a bicycle in pedestrian areas, reports TASS with reference to the Association of tour operators of Russia.
In addition, it is mentioned that the authorities provide a fine for inscriptions on monuments 400 euros and for garbage 25 euros.
To inform tourists about the need to comply with the rules of conduct in Venice will be with the help of a special company "Enjoy, respect Venice" (#EnjoyRespectVenezia) in social networks, as well as through announcements and posters on the website of the city council, on billboards and in places of the largest gathering of tourists.
The campaign will be conducted in 10 languages.
According to the Venice tourism adviser Paola Mar, information about the fines will be transmitted to the embassies of the home countries of the violators, in order to warn their compatriots of such mistakes.
“The problem is that Venice is perceived as a beach,” she said.
In April, the administration of the Italian city announced plans to limit the tourist flow.
In Venice, there is already a successful restriction on the number of tourists visiting the center of the city.
Instead of 100,000 people wishing to attend the Festa del Redentore, only 60,000 guests were allowed to attend.
In addition, a moratorium on the creation of new hotels and fast food restaurants in the historic part of Venice was introduced.
In the first half of 2017, 272 illegal migrants were detained at the border with EU countries; 1,059 illegal migrants were detained.
This was reported in the state border service.

SF liberated Ozerov from the position of head of the committee
The Federation Council on Wednesday supported the statement of the Chairman of the Committee on Defense and Security Viktor Ozerov and dismissed him from this position.
He remains a senator from Khabarovsk Territory.
A statement requesting his release from the position of Lakes wrote last week.
He explained his decision by the need for rotation and his desire to "change the rhythm of life."

Electricity is cheap for both the residents and the producers of Buryatia
The decades-long efforts of the Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buryatia (Eastern Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for electricity consumers are beginning to bear fruit.
From 1 September, the cost of low-voltage electricity for industrial recipients will be reduced by 25%.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of the country in accordance with the Resolution of the Government of the Russian Federation "On Amendments to the Rules of the Wholesale Market of Electricity and Power and to the Combined Forecast Balance of Production and Supply of Electricity (Power) in the framework of the Unified Energy System of the Russian Federation on the prices" (No 17.07.2017).
As a result, the cost of electricity for Buryat commodity producers is reduced by a quarter, which will significantly facilitate the lives of small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For many decades, the leaders of the republic have bypassed the thresholds of Moscow's cabinets in vain attempts to level the region in tariffs with the neighboring Irkutsk region with a cascade of hydroelectric power plants on the Angara, flowing from Baikal, the main watershed for which is Buryatia.
It was only this year that the movement began.
In March, electricity tariffs for the population of the Republic were reduced from 4.24 rubles/kWh to 3.93 rubles/kWh, or 7.3%.
With the inclusion of Buryatia on the decision of the federal government in the List of territories of price zones of the wholesale market, for which the features of the functioning of wholesale and retail markets are established, a number of industrial consumers have emerged.
According to analysts, this is only the beginning, as the population of the Irkutsk region pays for kilowatt/hour 1.01 rubles.
But no one dares to name at least the approximate date of new tariff moves towards a decline for Buryatia.

The National Union of Unskilled, Municipal and Boiler Workers (GMB) is concerned about the investment at McVitie's factory in Glasgow
The union demands guarantees from McVitie’s cookie maker’s managers in connection with its long-term commitment to manufacturing at the Glasgow plant.
The Scottish branch of GMB reports that the company has quietly bypassed the issue of future investments at the Tolkro<0xC5><0xA1>e facility.
The factory, which produces, among other products, Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies, employs more than 500 people.
Pladis, the owner of McVitie, says it has invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the facility over the past few years.
The company adds that in the event of any changes in the work of the facility, employees and representatives of the trade union “will learn about them first”.
In a letter to the head of the facility owned by the company, the Scottish branch of GMB demanded from McVitie’s response to concerns that funding would not be allowed for the modernization of production lines.
Senior organizer Drew Duffy said: “Our union members are deeply concerned that we cannot get clarity from the facility’s general manager on the business needs and investment plan for the future of Tolcross.”
Families have worked here for generations, and the concentration of workers is great in local society and in the territory of Greater Glasgow; it is the most important pillar of decent work in the territory of high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, in terms of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising subsistence levels and chronic declines in production, East End Glasgow desperately needs the prosperity of production at McVitie’s factory.
According to Pladis, “The head of the Tolcross facility just yesterday received a letter from the Scottish branch of GMB, and the company will respond immediately, as we appreciate our continued cooperation with employees and representatives of the trade union.”
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting in Tolcross with employees and representatives of GMB, at which we discussed a number of issues openly.
We talked to employees about how, like all companies operating in the most competitive and unstable economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our actions – and this applies to all our facilities and areas of activity – to remain competitive.
“Over the past few years, we have invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in our Tolkien facility, especially in production lines and improving functional performance.”
We are fully aware of the value of Tolcross as a manufacturing facility, and in the event of any changes in the work on this facility, employees and union representatives will be the first to know about this.”
Putin says authorities will not give instructions to Rosneft and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin said that the Kremlin and the Cabinet should connect to the issue of gas supplies to the Eastern Petrochemical Company, but no one will give instructions to Gazprom, as well as Rosneft.
Thus, Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to the request of Igor Sechin to help resolve the contradictions.
The head of state pointed out that the relationship between Rosneft and Gazprom should be decided solely on the basis of market principles.
Earlier, Rosneft head Igor Sechin at a meeting on the implementation of major investment projects in the Far Eastern Federal District said that the lack of an agreement with Gazprom on gas for VNHC puts the timing of the project at risk.
Sechin noted that the dialogue with Gazprom on this issue continues.
Gazprom offers to find gas resources from the Rosneft perimeter, but we do not have such resources," Sechin added.
We will remind that Rosneft asked to allow it to use for the Eastern Petrochemical Company gas from the Kirin field of Gazprom, located on the shelf of Sakhalin.
In June, Gazprom said that negotiations on the issue are ongoing, and "there are no sharp corners there."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar’s move three years ago?
La Liga member may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not stop chasing Neymar after the club offered <0xC2><0xA3>189 million for his ransom, but did they warn Barcelona of setting a world record three years ago?
The sensational offer revived the summer transfer window when the League 1 club was ready to break the world record for the cost of the transition, more than twice the previous mark associated with Pogba's return to Manchester United last season for <0xC2><0xA3>89 million.
When the transition is complete, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world, as well as the highest-paid professional athlete in the world, as PSG offers him a salary of more than <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 a week net.
It is known that Barcelona are furious at how the proposal was expressed and how Neymar broke the contract, despite the fact that, according to a source close to the Catalan club, the club has always done everything possible for the player since his move from Santos in 2013.
But wasn’t the football world warned about such an opportunity three years ago by the president of PSG?
When Manchester City expressed an interest in hiring Blaise Mathuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Helaifi issued a strong warning to any club that would like to lure one of PSG's top players.
"I don't worry because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will stand against them, we will make offers to their players," he said.
“We have great respect for all the clubs.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, the consequences are waiting for them.”
Apparently, Barcelona crossed this line when the Spanish club earlier this summer expressed an interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti.
PSG has made it clear that it will not let the Italian player of the national team under any conditions, and now, probably, Barcelona is feeling the consequences of its offer in the form of the loss of one of its most valuable players, Neymar.
