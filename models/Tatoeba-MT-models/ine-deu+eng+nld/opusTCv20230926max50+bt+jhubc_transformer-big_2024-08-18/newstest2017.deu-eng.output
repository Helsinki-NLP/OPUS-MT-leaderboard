28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall.
The victim’s brother said he couldn’t imagine anyone wanting to hurt him, “He finally went up again.”
The body, found Wednesday morning in the Westfield Mall, was identified as 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, the San Francisco forensic department said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was classified as murder and investigations are ongoing.
The victim’s brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC’s KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who previously worked as a chef in Boston, had caught his dream job as a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokeswoman for Son & Daughter said they were “shocked and destroyed on the ground.”
“We are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him painfully,” the spokesperson continued.
Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank’s family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank initially lived in hostels, but that, "things finally went up for him."
“He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend,” Louis Garcia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he could not imagine anyone who would want to harm his younger brother.
He was a friendly person with a big heart.
His way of connecting with his family was to always cook us something, prepare us dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to take part in any kind of argument.
He was the brother who swam with the river.
“For everything that went wrong in the world, he was that uncut diamond that lit up brightly every day,” he said.
Anyone who has information on the case will be asked to call the SFPD's reference phone number at 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'm always put in drawers
Jennifer Aniston doesn’t always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood star has made this clear in an interview.
“I’m always put in drawers or get labeled from outside, which usually have little to do with me and reality.”
“I myself don’t have the desire to always be perfect and successful.”
"Honestly, I'm more into these things."
Jennifer Aniston, 47, can only laugh at being considered “Miss Perfect,” as she explains in the current “Cosmopolitan.”
The actress prefers to spend her time at home, in front of TV with loose rags and Mexican food, says the magazine.
To wit, she brings up the question of the desire for children: “We women don’t have to be married or have children to be perfect,” according to the Hollywood star.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love Is Not a Child's Game", Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film will be released on August 25th.
Golfer Langer receives the Sports Pyramid
His experience on the horse is very clear.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues looked for a bit of a change with a ride on the beach.
It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.
CHIO: "Golden Sport Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their evening of celebration, they were chasing home to the feeding troughs in a quick gallop.
One mile at this pace, I was scared.
“It wasn’t a good experience,” Langer says.
And so the riding career ended again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was again near horses.
He and his family were guided by the ALRV, and he did not even take a horse for photographic purposes.
Longer was the first time in Aachen and thus also at CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports aid handed the Goldene Sportpyramide to the man from Anhausen during a small gala.
There is no shortage of awards for the friendly athlete.
Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...
Even the Queen of England has beaten him.
He is the 18th winner of the Sports Pyramid.
In Aachen on Saturday he met the first prize-winner Hans Günter Winkler.
"This award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it will be awarded not only for sporting success, but also for social commitment."
For decades, Langer has been promoting young people.
And so he also passed on the prize money of 25,000 euros immediately.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time U.S. Masters winner was included in the "Hall of Fame of German Sport" on Saturday.
Among the winners are the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the turner Eberhard Gienger, the defenders Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, the Bob-driver Meinhard Nehmer, the judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumper Alwin Schockemölle und posthum.
Many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious company migrated to the spring stadium, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer distanced himself from the big animals.
Clinton and Trump's economic policy: It's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade deal – that’s what both Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two U.S. presidential candidates disagree on tax and energy policy as well as on a matter of principle.
The difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
The one about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns of how the state can harm the economy – with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
He himself would be quite different, Trump claims.
He will push back regulations massively, and he is pushing for far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates – for private individuals and for businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says: The state has certain tasks to perform, it has disadvantaged opportunities to open up, and it needs money to do so.
That is why taxes would be increased for the rich, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure.
They should be invested in, Trump and Clinton say almost the same thing.
The Democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.
State investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected, for example, by the state-critical Tea Party wing of Republicans.
So, there could be internal party discussions on Trump.
The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and boost coal production in the United States again.
Oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, he wants to terminate the Paris Climate Agreement.
Clinton, on the other hand, wants to explicitly expand renewables with her investment program and calls for: “A country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs.”
“It’s probably going to be either China, Germany or America – I want us to be.”
But not only in terms of infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart.
The TPP, the Trans-Pacific Trade Agreement, both do not want to sign.
At the same time, however, both do not want to isolate the US from international trade – but simply better protect American jobs.
They should also be paid better, for example, Clinton demands.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a starvation wage.
He wants to raise it to $15 an hour.
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not entirely clear: once he says: The minimum wage must be raised, then he says it must not be changed.
However, the big discussion in the coming months is likely to develop rather around the tax policy of the two camps.
On one side is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth.
His critics argue that this would only increase the budget deficit.
On the other side is Clinton, who at least wants to ask the rich to pay more taxes, and whose critics say: More taxes are not the solution either.
Refugee: "Every refugee woman has experience with sexual violence"
Sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone, almost to everyday life.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
There are four women in a large kitchen.
Each has a baby who is at most one year old.
One of them put her little son in her arms.
He looks curiously into the room with big eyes.
His mother stares at the table.
Until she realizes she's being watched.
She smiles briefly and kisses the little one.
The scene seems normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the managing director of Condorbs, a provider of social services in Bavaria, and deals with, among other things, the topic of women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized housing units for refugee women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women’s Aid.
It was recently officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men, not even as visitors.
The exception is a guard at the door.
“It’s not an exaggeration to say: every woman who arrives here has experienced sexual violence on her escape,” says Bahr.
“Men flee because of wars, because they are politically persecuted, because they are threatened with torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as carriers of hope,” she said.
In women, other reasons for the escape outweigh: “Many steal from it secretly because they see no other way out.”
In their homeland, they have experienced sexual violence, coercion, honor killings, slavery or forced prostitution.
That drives her on.
On the run, it goes on.
“For example, for a bottle of water to demand a sexual act is not uncommon,” says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Those who believe that the end will come when they arrive in Germany are mistaken, says Bahr.
Here too, single women in refugee shelters are often considered inferior and, at worst, abused.
As a result, about 90 percent of women living in accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatized, she estimates.
"Some of the children certainly did not arise voluntarily".
Many women are so used to it that they say nothing.
"Or they don't dare to speak openly about the experience because the shame is too great."
Since they often didn’t know how to help themselves, more housing is needed just for them, Bahr says.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.
When asked if they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their area of responsibility, some answer no.
In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in government housing.
Even in Swabia, refugee women alone are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, a spokesman for the government.
In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia, in some community accommodation, there are floors or private houses only for single women and their children.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men.
A study published for the committee states: "It is very important that men and women are accommodated separately."
"If privacy is lacking or men and women are being accommodated together, there may be - ongoing - violence against women".
In particular, the washrooms should be separate and easily accessible for women, says the study.
How much women feel this need for protection can be seen from the pressure on the house in Munich.
“Since it’s been talked about that we exist, we have a long waiting list,” says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Assistant doctors strikes: demands for new work-struggle measures
Representatives of the assistant doctors have called on their union to approve new work-struggle measures in their disputes regarding a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called on its entire council to approve more work-struggle measures starting in early September.
The JDC said ministers had failed to address concerns about the treaty.
In July, assistant doctors and medical students voted to reject a contract agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday night, JDC Chairman Ellen McCourt said the government would have remained "persistently quiet" about problems, leading to the contract being rejected.
She said: "In view of this, the JDC Board has voted to reject the proposed new contract completely and has requested official renegotiations to all your concerns."
In response to the government’s silence, the JDC Board today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating work-struggle measures beginning in early September.
The disputes led to assistant doctors striking six times this year, the first total failures in the history of the NHS.
The head of the BMA Assistant Doctor Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed contractual terms recommended by the BMA.
He informed BMA members during the sessions, which were held before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students, that the contract was beneficial and should be adopted.
Following the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the contract for doctors in England would be enforced.
Russia and Turkey: An “Alliance of Foreigners”?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin welcomes his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was the handshake, yes.
But Putin’s smile seemed narrow-lipped and he radiated little heat, even for his restrained conditions.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old pre-crisis levels, but even improve.
The next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan had acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
His enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite to me.
But a radiant, sustainable cold from Putin showed that the head of state of Russia had not forgotten anything.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shooting down of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border by Turkey.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Putin handed out and accused Ankara of falling on Russia’s back.
The crime was even greater, as it was committed by an alleged friend.
Rebuilding trust will be difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, state-controlled media carried out a violent, unfettered attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.
The most serious were the accusations by senior officials that Erdogan’s own family would have benefited from the illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He vehemently denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan that he wanted to hear.
Russia had a kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clearly evident.
Erdogan needs, first and foremost, all the friends he can get after he was almost removed from office last month in a failed coup.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shocked him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard – particularly the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has decreased by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be made easier when the flights are resumed.
They are counting on a late-season storm to the Mediterranean.
This week, state television forecasted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports were allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti put it this way: "Tourists there long, tomatoes here long."
But the visit had an added political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West as its response to the attempted takeover is seen as a weak response.
In addition to this, there is the continuing turmoil over the snail pace of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship with the West.
The Russian head of state certainly won a bonus in Ankara for demanding support for the elected state bodies after the attempted coup.
This is, of course, a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change.
The summit in this shiny seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to represent one, as an analyst once described to me, “alliance of outsiders”: two countries that are disfellowshipped from the West and feel ill-treated and now allied.
Yet, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents said at the press conference that they had not even stripped the issue.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin chose to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found for Syria.
But after months of open hostilities – and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet – it is certainly better that the two heads of state at least talk to each other again.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to customers outside of Scotland
According to the CEO of the bank, the RBS brand is only to be reduced to a backoffice role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank’s global ambitions.
The bank has distanced itself since it almost collapsed and had to be rescued eight years ago.
During this time, brand strategists have used "RBS" to protect other end-user financial brands.
She supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus on more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralized head office and the stock exchange listing will switch to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already being used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for the private customer business that will receive more importance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: “The RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed as we now become more of a bank of brands.”
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I am now saying that we are not pursuing global goals, but local ones.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the perceptibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.
“It’s time for us to develop into a bank of brands, because how do we focus inside (we asked) to make this a better bank for customers?” said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands.
But with our work, focusing on customer needs and not our own, I think, you will see a lot of changes.
We can relaunch these brands, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori wins 3,000th at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket, which brings him 3,000th profit
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He bet on Predilection, which is trained by John Gosden, on his local racetrack with his second win of the night a milestone.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dettori, who had previously won on Ghayyar, said, "It's something special."
I’m very emotional because my family is here too.
I am very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very modest.
Dettori picks up the cheer when he gets the victory on Predilection
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle course – Jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derby winner had 4,493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modern times and it’s no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few before him have reached.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that sets him apart from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have been enthusiastic fans of this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have already made 6,000 wins if he hadn’t been just a weekend and big tournament jockey!
Frankie has been a winner in the UK for almost 30 years, which is great.
He has a vibrant personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that, he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the hallmark of British flat racing for two decades.
It was nerve-wracking.
A number of major tournament wins, including his famous "Glorious Seven" in 1996 in Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago, he initially struggled when he returned from his six-month lockdown, but he showed impressive character strength to defy his doubts and return to his best form.
And he’s far from over – Dettori has once said that he wants to continue in competitions until he is at least 50 years old.
Russia's Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly fired his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
For many years, Ivanov was part of Putin’s closest circle of trust.
The 63-year-old has been appointed Special Commissioner for Environment and Transport.
In a statement, the Kremlin said that Putin, without giving reasons, "ordered the dismissal of Ivanov from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration."
Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov’s deputy since 2012, has been appointed as his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the renowned Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the Kremlin’s website (in Russian) it says that he was later chief of protocol and chief of staff of government personnel.
Speaking about his appointment, he said to Putin: “Thank you for your trust.”
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your work as Head of State with regard to bills and controls on the implementation of your instructions.
Putin told Russian TV on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Do the smiling faces convince?
This step has made Moscow a mystery.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin’s closest confidants and works as he does for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the chief of staff resigned at his own request.
But despite the smile for the cameras, few are convinced of this – especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of some kind of power struggle?
Nobody knows that at the moment.
But the official claim – that a man once praised as a potential president wants to lead Russian environmental policy all at once – was met with great skepticism.
In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin’s website, Ivanov said, “It is true that I asked you in a conversation in early 2012 to entrust me with this very complicated post – you could almost say – to this cumbersome post for four years.
As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov assumed the post in December 2011.
Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the State Security Service KGB.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of the five people he trusted the most.
It was once believed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin’s second term, as a third term would have violated Putin’s constitution.
But this post was taken by another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before becoming president again three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after hitting producers
Gibson was involved in a physical confrontation on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced in a joint statement its termination.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, publicly apologized on Thursday before announcing his resignation.
At the set there were artistic differences and a difference of opinion.
I regret the incident," he said in a statement.
Details of how Gibson’s character from the series, which follows a team of FBI agents, is expected to be released at a later date, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios said in a statement.
The 54-year-old, who previously played in the sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been with the show since the first season of the series in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and I've put all my heart's blood in the last 12 years," Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that will no longer be possible.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and especially the best fans that you can only wish for a series.
The planned broadcast of the twelfth season is set for September 28.
Puzzles about fish that landed in garden in Banff
A resident of Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks the 75 fish could be sandalwood spied out by a fountain.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted on Periscope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone might shed some light on the appearance of the two-inch-long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of Queensferry Crossings to the viaduct – meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "cover blowers" approaching completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 oblique ropes.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown paid a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossings.
We are all witnesses of engineering of a truly epic scale in this project of over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, completing the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fit.
In total, almost 79% of the entire bridge deck is in place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete cast for the deck in Rosyth today, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge in its place.
Michael Martin, Project Manager at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first closure represents a significant milestone for every bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents forward-looking high- and low-rise construction.
After the installation of the last section of the road deck and its connection to the Nordturmdeck under construction, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north or country side.
This was achieved by drawing the northern feeder bridge 700 millimetres south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Massive, as the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of about 3%.
Heikel, since the tolerances the team is working on were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Thankfully, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men have "luck to be still alive"
Three men are “happy to be alive” after being thrown from their fishing boat off Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station struck an alarm at 13:20 BST on Friday after a crew watched the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming safely while their boat was moving on its own.
“We saw the boat spinning around in their vicinity and imagined the worst,” said Vince Jones, the head of the Moelfre rescue station.
"Fortunately, the strong winds have already swept the boat out of their reach until we got to water," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found hanging on a boje without a life jacket.
They all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were taken back to the rescue station
Mr Jones said: "The three men who were thrown into the water are lucky to be undamaged and still alive.
Although the boat engine had an emergency stop, it was detached from the person who controlled the boat when the boat was being cut.
Someone's been watching over these men today.
Seriously injured - Man stabbed to death by his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously injured her.
As the police announced yesterday, the 50-year-old had been given the key to the apartment to pick up his personal belongings.
Instead, the alcoholic slit the clothes of his ex-girlfriend.
When he came to the apartment, he ran into her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured in her hand and body.
The police were able to arrest the perpetrator.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend’s clothes, he called his mother.
He then alerted his sister.
Together with her life partner, the 45-year-old wanted to reassure her brother.
She couldn’t force him to leave the house.
That's why she left the house with her life partner.
On the street, they met the man’s ex-companion.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds Braunschweig’s low-cost apartments?
The SPD and the Greens believe that investors should be taken into account much more in the future.
How do you respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1,300 affordable apartments in the coming years?
The SPD proposes for the next Council meeting a "living action concept".
Dispute is programmed.
First of all, it is about the question: who should actually build the cheap apartments?
There is no regulation so far.
SPD faction chairman Christoph Bratmann said: "We agree with the Greens: If you want to build on urban areas, in the future, you have to identify 20 percent of all apartments as social housing."
However, the favorable apartments can also be created in the stock.
However, the big point of contention in the town hall is, according to Bratmann, "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?"
“We want investors to build at least 10 percent, but as much as possible 20 percent of homes as social housing on such areas.”
A new urban housing funding program, which will cost millions and still needs to be funded, is set to provide incentives.
The problem, says Bratmann: "There is no agreement between the factions at the moment."
The CDU wants to make as few regulations as possible for investors.
The Left still wants tough stipulations for investors.
Nevertheless, according to Bratmann, the situation in the housing market is intensifying.
If the action concept is implemented, this will ensure additional tasks in the construction administration.
More staff is needed.
It is not clear if we will get the specialists.
However, the program is not yet complete: because the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.
But how do we compensate for the loss of around 1,300 more affordable apartments, whose funding will run out in the next few years?
By 2020 alone, there will be 500 homes.
To prevent this, according to planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm, now expired bonds should be purchased from the city.
In addition, it would have to be considered to bring apartments back into the price bond.
This is possible in the West City.
At one point, the problem could be solved.
Because in the western city deadlines expire at the end of the year.
Around 1800 apartments could be brought back there in the price commitment for cheap apartments.
The owners, the housing companies, don’t want that.
Because the number of social housing in the western city is again increased drastically, one moves away from the goal of so-called intermixing.
There should be no more concentration of the socially weak in just a few districts.
The Greens expect that there will be movement in the discussion.
Group chairman Holger Herlitschke said: "For a broad majority, the CDU needs to get into the boat."
It has focused on more construction sites for single-family homes.
But that does not mean that no compromise can be found.
Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that’s worth it
It is fascinating to watch the world change.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but rather prefer to spend their free time staring at screens, has been lamented by many over the last decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people off the couch and making them more active.
The screen time was initially limited to the TV, then to video games and finally to smartphones.
Therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
I am referring, of course, to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters first created for video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, game cards and other spin-offs were created).
Like many phenomena of pop culture, before the release of the game in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July, interest dropped slightly.
Market launch in other countries was delayed by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.
Within days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players go out with their smartphones and look for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS and, once found, can be “photographed” (via a screenshot on their mobile phone) or “captured”.
A generation who played the game when she was still younger joined the madness and jumped in search of the sofa.
In the US, the game led to a significant increase in steps taken by the “average” person every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, the Washington Post recently reported that within two days of the game’s launch, the number of people tracked who exercise 30 minutes a day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn’t know who’s playing Pokémon Go – it just sees the raw data for performance gains.
Many public health outreach campaigns that want people to “take 30 minutes to get off the couch” and “be active every day” hit deaf ears because many public health outreach messages are boring and come from people who look miserable.
However, the importance of sport cannot be overstated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of getting cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people do something outdoors that makes them fun.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun.
Some people even make new friends on the hunt.
As always, there are also grumpy game spoilers who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could walk against a door.
What's the point?
There's been a breakthrough.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity before, they gave us no reason to do sports like this game does.
The new will lose its appeal and use will decrease over time.
Due to Pokemon’s success, however, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with being active in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles Creates Gold in the Ladies' Tournament
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamically on the jumping horse.
Easily on the bar.
Stunning on the floor.
All in all brilliant.
And now, finally, the Olympian.
The 19-year-old American gymnast climbed to the multi-match title on Thursday, widening the gap between herself and the rest of the world in the spotlight of the Olympic Games.
Their total score of 62,198 was clearly ahead of silver medalist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
The American Simone Biles is touring on the fly during the women's singles multi-fight final in the art tournament at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American to win a multi-fighting title and the fifth overall while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation or even at all.
She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey came to an end at that moment.
This success places them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who have brought their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 World Championship medals – including 10 gold medals – with such amazing exercises that involve a mix of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic winner Mary Lou Retton said of her that she is “the best turner I have ever seen.”
She expected a final test in Brazil, a competition that went not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.
Not returning to the family in Spring, Texas with a handful of gold would be considered a disappointment.
The Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman hugged each other after winning gold and silver in the women’s singles multiplayer finals at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles picked up the first medal on Tuesday, while serving as a exclamation point at the farewell ceremony to retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted, during her long journey to the top, never to have planned the future, this is not really true.
Some of their ground exercises – which include their typical Tumbling Pass – are tuned to Latin American music that would fit on the street outside of Rio’s Olympic Arena at home.
That's no coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a young child and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman’s mother during a school trip to the gym where Boorman trained, became a force.
She has not lost a multi-player competition since the summer of 2013, a winning series that will last as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafina led lightly through two turns, the picture was misleading.
Floating bars and ground tours - in which Biles holds the world title - were lurking.
She picked up again with 15,433 on the hover bar - and put another one on with a 15,933 on the floor.
Raisman gently embraced her as they awaited her final result—a mere formality—and tears flowed over Bile’s shiny red, white, and blue eyeliner when the vision she once described in her collection became reality.
Raisman's performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a tiebreak.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, who is called "Grandma" by the Americans, had a head start.
After her ground practice, she kissed the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed dubious.
As for Biles, the rapidly spreading tweet of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims shot dead in serial murder while listening to music in car
According to police reports released on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of the deadliest attacks in a decade in Phoenix’s first serial murder while talking in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot dead on June 12 while the car was parked in a driveway, authorities said.
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, the report reads.
Police said the triple murder does not appear to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 that were in the possession of one of the adult victims.
Phoenix police spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shooting led investigators to take a closer look at whether it was linked to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed and two others injured in nine attacks in Spanish residential areas within four months.
"It's happening in a residential area in front of a house," Howard told KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for her injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Elli's daughter Maleah died on the spot.
A witness told police that it was not uncommon for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting, which targeted an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and is believed to have been the work of the serial killer.
Investigators found cartridge sleeves and secured a bullet from the seat as well as bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It's getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and of course his mother.
But like the few of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing about during her pregnancy.
When he came home for the first time, my first thought was, I can’t do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't get into that.
Which is not true at all -- of course you've been indulging in it," she said.
Her husband Vincent and her were told that Edmund might never recognize her and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest institutionalizing him.
“My first response to that was ‘I didn’t know people were still doing it,’” Picciuto said.
Edmund can walk with the help of a walking aid.
Edmund could not sit or crawl until he was three years old, and he still could not speak.
But he is slowly making progress.
He can run with support and cycle.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund came up with for "Please Sing Something For Me."
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented some signs on his own.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetic as with Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the Zika virus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zika virus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I kept asking what was going to happen.
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven’t asked for the forecast for a long time, because I don’t expect anyone to really tell me.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of babies with birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
It's getting better.
You know it will get better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains, flooding gives rise to rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rains expected throughout Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi flooded their banks and threatened large-scale flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service reported.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and help for the affected communities is already on the way.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags were increasing.
Steele said that the municipality of Tangipahoa alone had requested ten thousand sandbags.
A flood warning system will be in place across much of southern Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service said there could be an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain in the area.
A flood warning system was deployed in southern Alabama on Friday, while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouges and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels over the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann says both rivers could flood many homes in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Parish poses a danger as these will only flow slowly into Lake Maurepas over the stepped rivers.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 9 a.m.
Rescue teams were still feeding people from the floodwaters in the Amite and Wilkinson districts in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet from his house, rose sharply overnight.
He said that another stepson, who lives nearby, had warned him.
“We woke up and the water was flowing and flowing in,” Hansford said.
It reached my waist.
His wife told Hansford that she had never seen such a high-rise of the river in the 48 years she lived there.
Hansford said he and his family members had all the disabilities and he would be the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that emergency workers had rescued all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire brigade in Gloster, where they were housed until Friday.
Krautmann said the flood had "spread rapidly" as there continued to be heavy rains and that authorities were considering evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil has been heavily soiled by the rains since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rains and flooding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and school failures in five school districts.
The CBS subsidiary broadcaster WWL reported that a co-worker in Tangipahoa reported 200 flooded houses.
The residents were evacuated in two churches, which were now flooded.
The head of the community, Robby Miller, said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets washed up by the floods.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency shelters were set up to accommodate the evacuated.
“As soon as the water starts to go back, they will be able to go back to their homes,” he said.
In the town of Hammond in the municipality of Tangipahoa, nearly two dozen roads were closed due to the flood and sandbags were provided for the residents to carry, hoping to keep the water out of their homes and shops.
“The last major flood we had was in March,” said Lacy Landrum of the city administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, Harrison County Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy said it was still raining on the Gulf Coast.
According to him, a handful of houses were reported to have been flooded on Thursday, but no reports have been made so far on Friday.
Keith Townson, Manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
“I’ve seen water in places I’ve never seen it before,” Townson said, “and it’s still coming.”
Mahaj Brown, 6, "Hot by bullets", survives shooting in Philadelphia
Police say the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week for the second time that a 6-year-old child has been shot.
The boy's grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents stated that Brown suffered several gunshot injuries, including in the lumbar, leg, arm and abdomen, but that he was conscious during his transport to the hospital.
"He's been through a lot, his little body was pierced by bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy’s condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several surgeries.
The boy’s family informed the station that he was expected to recover.
He should have started the first class in a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot dead in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old, who is in a critical condition, the broadcaster reports.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether one of the injured men may be among the perpetrators.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there appeared to be a crossfire between several shooters.
Cartridge sleeves for assault rifles, which were traced back to various assault rifles, overlooked the scene.
It seems that this was clearly an ongoing struggle.
On the road, on both sides of the walkway, there were sleeves.
So there seems to have been several armed fighters here who were very actively involved," police skin man Anthony Ginaldi told the Philadelphia police station.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
No arrests were made and police are currently reviewing the surveillance video, according to reports.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit by a crossbow in her arm as she was playing outside her home in the residential area of West Oak Lane.
She is recovering and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That’s what I’m imagining in the women’s Olympic team in the gym and for more than one reason.
Firstly, I have been at every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.
And secondly: this team has three female gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who were inspiring for many young girls of other skin colors.
The structure of this team, which rounds out Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team is finally reflecting the United States.
It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
For the past four years, number one among female gymnasts has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
This shows strength.
At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympian and America cheered.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of three-time world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterful gummy routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth heterosexual American to win gold at an individual women’s multiplayer event.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We are experiencing the top of this sport, but this is not how gym classes look throughout the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make it to the Olympic team.
They are the "Last Five" because the next Olympic team will have only four female gymnasts in the team. Also, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as coach.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnasts primarily in private gymnasts, which are maintained by parents who come up with the training, furnishing, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families).
The majority of these gyms are located in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs, the gymnasts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started training.
We need to enable the communities of countless young girls, inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, to have a more affordable and easily accessible gymnastics training.
I founded my 20-year-old gym foundation.
At my events, we have offered free and affordable gymnasiums in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer high-quality gymnastics to youth who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Training develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.
It’s the inspiration of this team that makes thousands of young girls interested in training and that’s great.
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by getting the Olympic team gold and thank you, captured so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to start their way to becoming healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistant Doctors Want to Organize Further Strikes After Rejecting Jeremy Hunt’s Proposal
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who voted in an election rejected it.
In July, Hunt had unveiled plans to enforce the contract, saying the NHS was in a "no-man's-land" and any further delay would be detrimental to employees and patients.
The first assistant doctors are to receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care at unwelcome times.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, the chairman of the BMA Committee on Assistant Physicians, said in a statement last night: "Assisted physicians continue to have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will inflame the current workforce crisis and fail to deal with all physicians."
With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and the time runs out.
Efforts by the BMA to resolve disputes through talks met with the government’s reluctance to engage and sometimes with deafening silence.
This was the result of a promise Jeremy Hunt made last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift the imposition and address the concerns of the assistant doctors".
If he does not do so, the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work combat measures.
The last strike at the end of April saw a delay of nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 appointments as nurses and specialist doctors were involved to provide coverage to doctors on the strike mail chain.
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reformed contract with officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekly salary for the 54,000 assistant doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, director general of the NHS staff, called on the assistant doctors to end the strike.
Mortimer said, “Work-fighting measures accomplish nothing but burden already overburdened teams and service providers and only provide the patient, caregiver and their families with care, distress and interruption.”
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Assistant Physicians and responded positively to the concerns regarding guardianship and whistleblowing with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.
Employers hoped that May’s continued positive commitment to other important topics—such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a career break, training skills, mutual recognition of the curriculum, continuing education leave, and gender pay gaps—were the signs of health in the workplace.
The <0xC2><0xA3>2 per day drug that can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of myocardial infarction patients will benefit from a <0xC2><0xA3>2 per day drug after authorities have recommended giving it to more people for a longer period of time.
The anticoagulant drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already given for 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The NHS’s NICE regulator has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS’s NICE regulator has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the arterial walls that form linings.
If the coating breaks down, it can cause a blood clot that clogs the blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
When the blood clot dissolves, it can flow through the bloodstream and clog the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of having another one.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more unlikely.
NICE’s draft guide, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg of ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Center, said: “Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke – often with disastrous consequences.”
Fear of a recurrent heart attack can have significant negative effects on a person’s quality of life.
Experience shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
Through a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
The information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years. The draft leaflet does not recommend treatment beyond this period.
Culture of Political Correctness Leads to Election Fraud in Muslim Areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was removed from office last year on the basis of a government report on corruption.
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread voter fraud being deliberately ignored in Muslim communities, as a devastating government report revealed today.
Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks police, election observers and town halls for ignoring evidence of election abuse due to “ethnic and religious sensitivities.”
The former Minister of Integration and Local Government, who is now a king of anti-corruption, said intimidation of voters on religious grounds would be so bad that police should be allowed to set up restraints outside polling booths to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters should carry an ID card with them to prove their identity in elections.
At the moment, a voter only needs to name his name and address.
The report suggests applying non-removable ink to a person’s finger when they cast their vote to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should get more protection, says Sir Eric.
He calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions from unofficial committees or working groups.
“This serves not only against election fraud, but also to protect the municipal government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes along with it,” he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet election scandal in East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that incumbent mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had "perverted the religious sentiments of his Muslim community in a cynical way" and that he had silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman is said to have "led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to elect him."
Up to 300 votes were either questionable or the result of an imitation in which one person elects someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He was particularly alarming about the fraudulent choice of letters - where older members of the Muslim community had pressured people to choose a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including running ID cards to prove identity
Its report states: “As evidence, pressure was put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, to choose according to the will of the elderly, especially communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds.
“There were concerns that ... state institutions would have knowingly ignored such behavior due to ‘politically correct’ oversensitivity to ethnicity and religion.”
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists from editing ballot papers to stop “electors.”
The report, which is being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral roll from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters for your ID before choosing.
Use non-removable ink on a person’s finger once they have cast their voice to prevent someone from voting twice.
Perform systematic checks on a person’s nationality to ensure that they are eligible to vote.
A three-year limitation on applications for an automatic letter selection.
Prohibition of political activists from editing complete letter elections and envelopes of letter elections.
The police are empowered to set up constituencies around polling stations.
An amendment to the law that facilitates an intimidation charge under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Prohibition of photography in polling stations.
Requirement that only English may be used in polling stations (except Wales).
Intensification of training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go to the polling booth alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "astonishing" that no criminal charges have been brought after the Tower Hamlet case.
"The Electoral Court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy unsuitable for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
He was found guilty for a number of reasons of sufficient - in accordance with the high requirements in criminal proceedings.
He also criticizes the ineffective "abhak checks" of the electoral registration departments of the town halls.
Sir Eric said: “Last year’s court verdict in Tower Hamlets was a warning sign.
Our country has a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial by some authorities threatens this good reputation.
Crazy after Kate's Radler double and other famous doubles of Olympic athletes in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio this week have stumbled across French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proven to be an impressive double rider of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But this summer, the 24-year-old Olympian is far from the only gold-fighting athlete with her own famous double – at least not if you can trust social media.
In honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces currently flickering on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympians who have more than just a certain resemblance to Hollywood celebrities.
The Hunter and the Wolf: Team member of the US team in archery Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since his childhood
Aside from Kate’s double at the track, many people on the internet pointed out how a certain archer might be the twin of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio.
U.S. archery team member Brady Ellison has caused an uproar on Twitter after images that he sees eerily similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star surfaced.
In fact, the archer got the madness on social media and admitted that since his childhood, he gets to hear that he looks like Leo.
“I myself don’t see much resemblance, except for facial hair,” Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I'll take that as a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London in 2012 will undoubtedly focus even more this year: the apparent similarity between the British wide-spreader Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina with her big, expressive eyes should be able to go through as a double for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years.
A step higher: This user is of the opinion that Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception actor
Another lasting comparison was made between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similarly heavy eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver-medal swimmer Yulia Efimova has more than just sun-tanned skin and blond hair like actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian has been attested by fans to resemble an “athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt.”
Strong women: football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: A Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the similarities
Theory put into the room: According to this user, there may be a reason for the similarity of the pair
A Twitter user stated her satisfaction that "the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are nearly identical."
In fact, American football star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medalist in the gym Gabby Douglas, who has her own beautiful, broad smile similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympic commentator apologises for his statement that Chinese swimmer "died like a pig"
Byron MacDonald’s analysis of the fourth place finish of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at the 4x200m freestyle swimming team infuriated viewers of the CBC live broadcast of the Olympic Games on Wednesday
Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologise after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "died like a mief" and during the race "died like a pig".
Commentator Byron MacDonalds thought his microphone was turned off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle swimsuit.
MacDonald, who had been brought on board the CBS commentator team to give more “color,” could be heard saying, “This 14-year-old Chinese girl has lost the connection, baby.”
Too excited, he went off like a slut, died like a pig.
Thanks for that.
The Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of the swimming season 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, which allowed the Canadians to open the gap to China.
Viewers across Canada responded quickly online after being shocked by the tone and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, “Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China “died like a pig”???
The idiot didn't understand that they were still on broadcast."
Ai Yanhan from China was described at the final 4 x 200m freestyle women's swimming stall as follows: "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
The criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and harshly, with many putting him on the spot
Twitter users didn’t hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote, "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all look like racists.
Shortly after, Scott Russell, who moderated the CBC show, apologised live for MacDonald’s comment, saying, “We apologise that the comment was broadcast about a swimming performance.”
It was an unfortunate formulation, we're sorry it happened."
CBC finally apologized more than 90 times to the people who responded to the tweet
Scott Russel apologised on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and posted its apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald’s comments.
The network also apologized quickly and issued a message.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on the show last night and to our followers on social media.
To be clear, Byron’s comments referred to the swimmer’s performance and not to her as a person.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and an unfortunately chosen wording. Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized in the broadcast and tried to justify his remark by stating that it was not his intention to interpret it as a personal attack.
"I'd like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's swimming season on the CBC Olympics broadcast," he said.
"I've been referring to the swimmer's performance and not to her as a person."
Of course, no disrespect was intended and I am very sorry."
Buyer in Primark indignant about woman trying shamelessly underwear in the middle of the store
The buyers did not know where to look when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a Primark to try on underpants.
To aggravate the situation, she showed what she looked like in it, pulled her out, and put her back on the shelf.
She continued to browse and tried out four pairs of underpants at a store at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone.
The Primark store at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone, where the woman tried on the underpants before putting them back on the shelf
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman tried on the underwear, "she got dressed again and left the store without buying anything."
She said, “People couldn’t believe what they saw.”
Standing in the middle of the sales area, she took a pair of underpants from the outlet, took out her own pantyhose and pants and tried them on.
“She didn’t even try to find a slightly more discreet place to do it — she just stood there, as rude as Oscar.”
"Everyone stared as she pulled out the underpants again, which she obviously didn't like, as she put them back on the shelf."
She repeated the same thing with three other underpants before finally deciding that she didn’t like anything, got back on and went out.
"She didn't seem to bother watching anyone - or thinking about the person who might be buying the underpants she had tried."
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said, "How disgusting to think that someone would take home underpants that were worn by another person and that were not washed."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added, "As I have seen, the employees have been trying to pull the garments out of the sale after she left - which is just as good."
“I would hate to go home with a new pair of underpants and find out that another woman wore her and pulled out again and she wasn’t washed.”
A spokesman for Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday, August 9 at our branch in Folkstone."
All products in question were withdrawn from the sale.
How to Protect Yourself from Gun Attacks with Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, a grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether approaching you from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the spear for your robber.
As you approach from behind, you should turn around first so you can see your attacker and “get off the line of fire,” Mizrachi says.
Then grab the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting him in the face with your free elbow.
Then hit him with the knee to the bar and twist the gun from his hands as the attacker curls in pain. Hit him in the face with the run and move backwards as they point the gun at him.
For attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the line of fire, grab the weapon and twist it so that the attacker can not shoot.
At the same time, shift the weight on the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then twist the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and pointing the weapon at it.
Sounds difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how it looks like Mizrachi.
But remember that in case of a robbery, it is safest to hand over your money - unless you are a Krav Maga grandmaster.
Traveler Ian Wright scrapes his tongue for a guide in the dirtiest places in Europe
A British traveler underwent a serious test of his immune system and swirl reflex - by dislodging some of Europe's dirtiest and most disgusting places.
Travel author and moderator Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, scraped his train on a Euro bill, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a wash knob of a train toilet, and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.
Before leaking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was going to do.
But the experiment, filmed under the title “The Lickhiker’s Guide to Inner Strength,” brought some surprising results to light.
The idea of licking the sink button of a train toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing left that he unleashed was more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright became known for testing the resilience of his gut by traveling the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public railings at railway stations to flushing buttons from toilets, the task definitely put his immune system to the test
As a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health, and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and sludge.
In the film, he certainly deserved his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His sample sample showed a luminometer number of over 4000 units.
In comparison, the number of luminometers of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick after its luminometer count was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60.
Mr. Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
In the movie, he says, "That comes close to the worst I've ever smelled in a toilet."
There is nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not going to lick anything here because it's disgusting in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio.
The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D to support the promotion of gut bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Juices and New Categories Niko Vuurenmaa says: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We did crazy brainstorms that ended up saying, "Let's call Ian."
They claim that interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context – the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health, and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "Let me put it this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I told him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film."
Of course, there were things where it was easier to get Ian to lick her and others where it was quite difficult.
I’m glad we’ve made some of these dirty treats on film.”
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all lactic acid bacteria in particular associated with the well-being of the stomach and intestines and 58 percent said they at least occasionally use products that contain added lactic acid bacteria.
Asocial family destroyed before delogging Social apartment in Saltash, Cornwall
An asocial family left their social housing after a delogging with a damage of <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 for terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were dumped after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.
After being forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable state.
The walls showed flapping holes, wooden parts were torn up, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smeared on the walls.
The family has been relocated and it is believed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for the House Administration at Cornwall Housing, said she feared the apartment could no longer be repaired.
She said: "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I believe that people don't have to live this way.
There are many things to consider as this property will probably be considered as not so beautiful part of Cornwall.
The family is infamous and so is their reputation.
The couple had three sons who were living in the apartment in the meantime and police said the terror the family had inflicted included street fights with baseball batsmen, intimidators of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, quarrels and curses.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an order for antisocial behavior in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be demolished, old rubbish was found
In the estate where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden partitions were torn up
Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and had to call the police regularly
Cornwall Housing forcibly delogged her and her partner from the property this week after giving them an extended 11-week deadline to voluntarily retire.
The delogging was cheered by relieved neighbors who said their lives were turned into hell.
One said, "They weren't kidding about anybody."
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are unbelievable.
“We couldn’t sleep this morning.”
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it's gonna be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager at Cornwall Housing, said the family had failed to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house to which the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years
On the overgrown side of the community house, garbage and old toys were thrown down
He added: "It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family, as delogging is always the last step the Cornwall Housing is considering.
This was a very difficult case, as the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be horrendous to their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, and members of the community who bravely came to us and gave us the information.
I hope that this development will provide comfort to some neighbours and convey the message that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said all three sons lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after delogging
Workers of the house administration will now have to clear garbage mountains that surround the house
In 2014, police raided the house and found over 70 grams of cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash worth <0xC2><0xA3>1,700.
Skeldon received a fine after she pleaded guilty to possession of a Class B drug for commercial purposes.
She claimed that the money for a gravestone was her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being homeless, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many room walls of the house were smeared with graffiti.
Police say they will delogge tenants who do not adhere to house rules
Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall Police said the delogging was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not comply with the house rules.
"This goes to those who think they can behave without self-blaming, as well as to those who have been harmed by such behavior," she said.
The Devon and Cornwall Police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal panic after a low-flying military jet overflys the beach
Sun worshippers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion aircraft of the Air Force set off an incredible crash flight
The Air Force stated that it was on a training flight, but insisted that there was no security risk.
This was the moment when frightened tourists began to panic after a deep-sea jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic video footage showed how the military plane flew almost within reach of the sun worshippers on the beach section in Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The vacationers jumped up as they understandably began to worry about the noise of the jet engines, without first seeing what was coming through the clouds at them.
The incident took place yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many vacationers who posted videos about the dramatic fly-by on social media, said: “It flew really deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it was going to crash.”
Nuno Arroja added, "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling down on me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were panicked when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them.
The spokesman said the jet flew slightly deeper than usual due to poor visibility due to nearby surface fires, but the air force insisted that safety was not at risk at any time.
Surface fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer, killing four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that due to the conditions - strong fog and fire smoke - the pilot had to fly so deep, which limited his vision.
The aircraft was on a training flight in which the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise.
Supercup: Barca worried about Sevilla
Sevilla - FC Barcelona are fighting on Sunday for the first step to the first title win in the new football season.
The Catalans compete in the duel for the Spanish Super Cup out against FC Sevilla, the playoffs rise three days later at Camp Nou.
The double-winner must renounce Neymar, among others, who competes with Brazil in the Olympic football tournament, in the competition with the inferior cup finalist and the reigning European league champion.
Goalie Marc-Andre ter Stegen is also missing.
The German suffered a slump in his knee during the training, which clarified the question at Barca at least for the time being in favor of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been competing in Barcelona for the status of number one for two years.
Coach Luis Enrique renounced a clear decision in this regard so far and left Bravo in the league, but for that Ter Stegen in most other applications.
Before the first mandatory game of the new season, there are doubts about the fitness of the team, which was humiliated on Saturday in a test game by Liverpool with 0:4.
Lionel Messi and Co. didn’t really know how to convince at the 3:2 rehearsal race against Sampdoria on Wednesday.
Sevilla, in turn, has to digest the 2:3 defeat after an extension in the European Super Cup against Real Madrid and aims for the second victory at the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona is the record-breaking winner in this competition with 11 successes so far.
Ma Long in his own league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic winner.
The 27-year-old defeated his countryman and "title defender" Zhang Jike 4-0 (12,5,4,4) in a one-sided final in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday.
With this, the world leader-first won the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes at World Cup, World Cup, World Tour final tournament and Olympia.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese managed as expected in the final game and won the title against each other.
It was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would get the single title in the sign of the Five Rings.
The last non-Chinese at the top of the Olympic ladder was former SVS-N<0xC3><0x96> legionnaire Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone on the record, between the sets and at time-outs they had no coaches with them.
They had retreated to the stands and left their defenders alone in a fair competition.
"I have played the matches for my country so far."
“In the final, I play for myself,” Zhang said.
After the match, gold and silver medalists posed with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.
Ma had to really fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first sentence.
After that, he determined the pace on the record and left Zhang there only a total of 13 points.
Due to Ma’s superiority, the expected thrilling match did not develop.
However, there were still enough breathtaking ball changes to be seen.
Mizutani won the bronze against 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4:1.
The Belarusian had suffered a rib injury in his quarter-final against the German European champion Dimitri Ovcharov, was then in medical treatment, had to "finally" settle for sheet metal.
The Swedes Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had by the way become Olympia-fourth in similar high age table tennis.
Donald Trump admits ‘enormous problems’ in the election campaign
The leadership of the U.S. Republicans is plagued by massive concerns about cutting their majority even in traditionally conservative states.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump now admitted weaknesses of his election campaign in the former Republican stronghold of Utah.
A rare moment in which the usually large-scale and self-confident multimillionaire expressed such concerns as correspondents reported.
After throwing 16 rivals out of the race within his own Republican camp, now doubts grow about his success in the fight for the White House.
“We have huge problems in Utah,” Trump told evangelical Christians, who he asked for support in major states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
Guilty of false reports about his candidacy, he again took up his well-known media skeleton.
Swinging Republican Fortress
Utah is usually a safe bank for Republicans.
According to a June survey by SurveyUSA, Trump and his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, were equal.
Other institutes see Trump ahead, but not with the distance that is common for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also at risk.
In an interview with CNBC, Trump responded to the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton’s advance again: “Just as I have done so far.”
“This will either be successful, or I will have a very nice, long vacation.”
He does nothing but “tell the truth.”
If it’s not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that’s okay,” Trump said.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, Trump’s party is said to have threatened to remove funds to support his campaign if he can’t present better poll scores.
Instead, the Republican candidates for Congress want to take more of the arm's length.
Olympia: Three-fold fraud on doping test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary committee on the case.
Kenyan athletes are facing a row after the second doping case at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
After a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic Village, Kenya has sent a coach home.
The International Olympic Committee said it would set up a disciplinary committee to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had reported that former sprinter and current coach, John Anzrah, had given a urine sample in the Olympic Village under the name of 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich.
This was reported to the team leadership of Kenya by the doping controllers.
The IAAF has asked the IOC for information on the case in order to push its own investigations, an IAAF spokesman said.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent actions of the IOC, the IAAF will conduct an assessment," the IAAF said in a statement.
"He (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and pretended to be Ferguson Rotich, took the sample and signed it," said mission chief Stephan Arap Soi.
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete, which was on the list for training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich was the fourth man to win the World Cup in Beijing in over 800 metres in 2015.
Four days earlier, the Kenyan athletics delegation leader Michael Rotich had been withdrawn from the Rio Games.
He is said to have informed athletes of his country about upcoming doping tests against payments.
According to media reports, he was arrested on his return from Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC after numerous doping offences for a long time.
When the IOC announced more than 2,000 doping target controls before the Rio Games, it was unusually pointed out beforehand that athletes from Kenya and Russia are being targeted in particular.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the Summer Games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before the start of the Olympics.
WADA subsequently removed Kenya from the list of countries whose anti-doping measures comply with WADA rules.
Kenya is considered a great runner nation.
The country’s athletes won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
A number of ARD television reports have repeatedly raised allegations that doping funds are easily accessible in Kenya and that there is a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had hired her in Russian athletics.
In this case, it was proved that in this sport it was doped extensively and systematically.
Russian athletes were then excluded from the Summer Games.
Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the year of Shakespeare, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic love couple, similar to Romeo and Julia.
It was a surprise for Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leonard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical to the temple of the classics and fulfilled a youthful dream with the role of Mary.
The Sim<0xC3><0xB3>n Bol<0xC3><0xAD>var Orchestra under the direction of the Venetian conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he sighs.
We always say that it is very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and their melody.
It is a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein’s music in our blood!
In this production, Bartoli plays an older Mary.
She remembers her love with Tony with weaning, while the younger Mary plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First of all, it’s because it’s musically extraordinary.
And then there was Mary’s personality.
She says it in her song, "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."
So she is smart, of course also naive, and very passionate.
“She is very similar to me, to my Italian character, which I have as a Roman woman,” Bartoli laughs.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It is such an honor to work with her.
She's an incredibly generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Directing is a necessity for him.
You see it in each of his movements, in his eyes, it's his life!
It is such a great opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a joyful approach to life, which is very important at all!
For the American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly topical: "This piece is about prejudice and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New Yorkers did not want them.
They are the same issues, and they are as meaningful today as they were then.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
London Schoolgirl Who Joined ISIS Killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned of her death a few weeks ago in Raqqa, Syria.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, the group's bullfighter in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died according to her family shortly after she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only good is that - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from East London boarded a plane to Turkey and then boarded a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana’s family was informed that she had married an ISIS fighter in Syria – and within a few months became a widow.
Reid says Clinton will remain as Supreme Court candidate in case of Garland’s election victory
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland’s confirmation since he was nominated by Barack Obama in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell believes the next president will appoint the successor to the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said Thursday during a conference call that he expects Clinton to select Garland "with some degree of certainty."
A spokeswoman for Reid later said he had not yet spoken to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland and he speculated.
He praised Garland and said Clinton’s team would not cause unrest with a new candidate.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Raid said Republicans blocked Garland’s nomination as a lackey and aide to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump is unsuitable for the presidency.
Treats wants nude calendar for "women and men"
Treats Magazine is working with photographer David Bellemere to bring out a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses calendar for 2017.
Treats editor-in-chief Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine is different from old-school playboys because “playboy is for men.”
I do this for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar does too.
“We need to return to depicting timeless and classic nudity in which both women and men feel comfortable and are inspired by these images of a female body,” Shaw said in a statement.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their images online or in person at open casting call in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community expects mass escapade
“Whoever doesn’t adapt and praises Erdogan sits on packed bags,” said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-based Dialog and World Foundation.
In the short term, the Kurdish community of Germany expects tens of thousands of asylum seekers to flee from Turkey to Germany.
In the medium term, it could even become “a few hundred thousand”, believes the chairman of the association, Ali Toprak.
Due to the harsh actions of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community in Germany expects a mass flight to Germany.
“In the short term, I expect tens of thousands, in the medium term, of a few hundred thousand asylum seekers from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight minorities and the democratic opposition,” Toprak told the “World” on Friday.
Because the government has already covered Kurdish strongholds with punishments months ago, 500,000 Kurds are fleeing inside Turkey.
After the failed coup, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks were added.
Many will want to start anew in Europe if they continue to be oppressed in Turkey.
“It cannot be that a state that takes in refugees itself produces refugees in its own country,” Toprak said.
The head of the association complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alevitic cities.
In doing so, Erdogan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been exterminated or expelled in the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The head of the association demanded that the German government "position itself as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters".
In Germany, too, there is a “witch hunt” against Erdogan’s critics.
For the first time in the last few months, I have not felt safe in Germany.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and opposition members.
Branding as a Gülen follower destroys teachers and other academics’ professional existence.
“Whoever doesn’t adapt and praises Erdogan sits on packed suitcases, by the way, also the Kemalists and secularists,” Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-close Foundation for Dialogue and Education, told the “World”.
As the newspaper reports, citing figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks were already the largest group of asylum seekers in Germany recognized for political persecution before the coup.
As of June 30, this was 11,386 people, making it nearly 29 percent of all asylum-seekers (39,625).
This survey does not include those who have fled war, poverty or hopelessness.
Asylum-seekers under the Basic Law are exclusively politically, that is, from the state side, individually persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals get nothing from the summer election campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Landtag.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.
In 2021, the parliamentary elections will not be held again at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because it’s no worse than before: summer holidays, heat and national elections – that bite.
The locals, who are to be persuaded by the election fighters, are on vacation.
The vast majority of holidaymakers who are in the country, traveling on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so they are not allowed to choose the Landtag.
In addition, there are practical problems: during the holidays, helpers who hang posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers, and at the end count out votes are only arduous to raise.
Until 4 September 2016, the last election day and holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must once again let the election campaign pass by the people.
The hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun.
And it’s also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD/CDU coalition, has to fear for his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.
It will be exciting how much newcomer AfD cuts off and what remains coalition-ready in the end.
Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, is running an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one looks away from his big posters.
He travels around the country, distributing roses and chatting a little with the people, just as his legendary vocal predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, Seelering has gotten cold feet and blames Chancellor Merkel for the AfD’s upheaval.
Their refugee policy, their "We can do this" has accelerated the rise of right-wing populists, which will now probably cost him the beautiful office.
The CDU, with its top candidate, Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it’s like to campaign in the wrong place at the wrong time.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to mass polls; Merkel’s Bundestag constituency is in the northeast.
But the target group did not vote, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliners and Saxons there than Mecklenburgians and Vorpommern.
"There was probably the majority from other federal states," Vincent Kokert, general secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently complained in the NDR.
But it also does no harm to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.
Otherwise, the Northeastern CDU largely renounces the usual campaign stands on marketplaces and in front of shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons.
That, according to Kokert, only plays a "subordinate role".
The Union has also noticed that you are blowing away the base on the ground, that it has to make a lot of effort to find a wire to the people again.
You are like the Left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly present in the vastness of the country.
However, the advice of CDU campaigner Kokert to his fellow contestants is also self-evident: "They have to go where it hurts, namely where the people are: village parties, Golden weddings, every birthday party must be used".
Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called for his SPD to be a particularly committed campaign.
In polls, the Social Democrats were most recently 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just a short time before the AfD (19).
In the 2011 elections, the SPD had clearly won with 35.6 percent ahead of the CDU (22).
The Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, are likely to make the leap into parliament.
They make the holiday emergency a modern virtue and shift their election campaign largely to the Internet.
"Online election campaign", says the country's president Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, green voters go in search of traces of local voters among the holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is curving through the Mecklenburg lakes with a houseboat and still finds it beautiful.
Her impression: "Election holidays in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern are not a punishment".
B27 remediation: restaurants suffer from lockdown
There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is being refurbished.
For those in charge of the construction work, which starts at 5.30 am and ends only around 8 pm, there is praise everywhere.
"They've made everything pretty zacky," says Elvira Tetzlaff of the jet tanker.
This is a super team.
There is no delay either.
The construction site could be relocated to the south at the beginning of the week at half-time, until the end of October.
It is also appreciated that the people responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to the establishment of emergency services, are in agreement.
Since the construction site has moved south on Monday and the blockade of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has also been lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg has been restored, the traffic situation within the town has relaxed.
Citizens can now drive from Ofterdingen from the B 27 again on both sides.
The evacuation traffic through the town seems to be going back.
“There were some significant complaints,” said Florian King, deputy chief executive officer responsible for the transport management of the renovation.
The inhabitants of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrrain had to struggle with more traffic noise because many sledgeways were looking for and more familiar with their navi than the signage.
As a result, some trucks became fringed in residential areas.
Since the speed limits were also not respected, the municipality intensified its demand for the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
“There were significant overruns,” says King, who made himself known about the situation on the spot.
There have been two to three flashes per minute.
The fastest was travelling 77 hours in the Tempo 30 zone.
Since the construction site has moved on, however, it has become quieter.
For the business people on the B 27 it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the road is now open again.
Business people don’t like to look at the cards.
But that the B 27 remediation has led to revenue cuts in them, lets everyone you ask see through.
However, some are more and some less affected.
Those who have less to do with the "end customer", i.e. produce for other companies, for whom the renovation has little consequences.
Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "highly slight decline" at Autohaus Maier, but also admits that of course "running customer service is lacking".
The most crowded are the locals along the road.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds clear words.
This is already a threat to existence.
Not only him, but all the restaurants have "hit it hard".
The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We have to be happy about every euro turnover.
The decline in sales is "far over 50 percent".
The renovation of the road has thrown back its operation "by two years".
Half of his employees had to be fired.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half had been fired, politics would have reacted differently.
Instead, Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt responded to a question from Göhner about whether there could be a financial compensation, with the indication that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27. Now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation.
Göhner knows of other counties where such a thing was handled more generously.
In all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.
After all, the family business has been settled here since 1715, he points to the long history.
He can understand that other regulars now pass by less often because of the complicated traffic management.
If you can't drive, it's nice elsewhere.
Göhner has no doubts that his main clientele will return after the renovation work is completed.
Despite the crises with BSE and bird flu, Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 construction work on his clientele to be the biggest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long history.
Six months of construction work, that's already brutal.
In the name of counter-terrorism, laws are constantly being enacted.
After the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re is now presenting a thick security package.
But what does tolerance have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re gives the Reconciliator.
All of his proposals are "politically reasonable" to the coalition partner, says the Federal Minister of the Interior when presenting his new security package.
You're not exaggerating anyone.
Other, further points would be discussed initially within the parties.
I am also involved in this.
As interior minister, however, he was concerned about results and about a "attainable consensus" within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re has allowed some time to pass before presenting his conclusions on security in the Republic.
However, they are now all the more extensive.
Some things are already known, announced, pointed out: that a new security authority should take care of cracking encrypted communications is not new.
Nor the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements on passenger data and gun law.
The call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is also not surprising.
In part, de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re is launching a second round of proposals that had so far nothing to do with the SPD: he wants to penalize sympathetic advertising for terrorist groups and double-citizen jihadists pulling off the German passport.
"This will be difficult points for the SPD," the CDU man admits.
He still considers this reasonable and does not demand anything that has no chance with the coalition partner anyway.
A few new ideas de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re also presents.
They have it partly in them: he plans rapid procedures for deportations and more possibilities for the detention of people before deportation.
Refugees who are being brought into the country should have their smartphones checked in advance and disclose social media accounts for a security check.
With tolerations for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than before - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to disguise their identity.
Some of them are politically and legally sensitive.
Some also seem unanswered and leave questions open.
And on some points - in the case of the unequal treatment of patients, for example - the question arises: what does this actually have to do with security and terror?
Yes, says de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terrorism.
But it cannot be said that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were concerned about safety in view of the high numbers of refugees.
And things that people were deeply concerned with, even in times of election campaigns, could not be ruled out.
The internal security has become a huge focus.
First the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The insecurity is great.
And yes, there are election campaigns.
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly positioned on the issue of internal security.
In the past few days, things have been going up between the two parties.
First a heated dispute over the equipment of the federal police, then a security policy collection of some Union interior ministers, in which the heads of departments also demand a burka ban and a departure from dual citizenship.
De Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re also strives for reconcilable tones here.
He doesn't care about a reversal of the double pass.
We have pacified the discussion in Germany.
Reopening them doesn’t make sense.
And in the case of a burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is constitutional in all corners and whether it is actually "too acceptable" for the coalition partner, has yet to show itself.
There is a lot in it that could cause a dispute.
But the SPD is also currently trying to profile itself on the issue of internal security.
Party leader Sigmar Gabriel signalled a cautious willingness to talk and said: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security".
Volkswagen is still coming through.
Despite the diesel scandal, the number of deliveries is increasing worldwide.
However, not all markets are around.
In the recall action, there is a swirl around a term.
Volkswagen will start in the second half of the second half of the year.
Europe’s largest car manufacturer can continue to show a plus in the course of the year, despite the diesel business thanks to its many brands and some well-run markets.
However, in July, the core brand of VW weakened mainly in Western Europe, thus again burdening total sales, as the company listed in Dax reported.
Worldwide, the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles in July with 449,100 cars than in the previous month.
In Western Europe alone, after China, the second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the previous month.
In Germany, deliveries fell by almost a sixth in the home market.
Brand sales manager Jürgen Stackmann led the weaker figures from July mainly down to two sales days less in Europe.
In addition, in some core markets there has been a buying restraint due to "changed economic conditions".
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote to leave the EU has also been burdened, a spokeswoman explained.
In the United States, where the exhaust gas business first escalated, there is also a downside.
Great support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, however, the mainly affected home brand of Lower Saxony continues to be glaringly affected by the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only a drop in deliveries of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is available.
Group sales manager Fred Kappler was able to show a further sales increase from January to July.
Volkswagen delivered 1.3% more vehicles in this period, worldwide 5.904 million.
Volkswagen had manipulated exhaust gas tests with a software.
In Germany alone, VW is calling for around 2.5 million cars to be converted into workshops.
In the course of the conversion, VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars does not have any negative effects.
After the conversion of the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance.
The automaker gives the customer a "guarantee-equal" certificate after the conversion, but does not speak of a "guarantee", as it was called on Friday in business circles.
This is due to legal finesse.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen is now granting its German customers a guarantee for re-equipped diesel models.
This was confirmed last Monday by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that this meeting had taken place.
"VW has to comply fully with the requirements of my commission of inquiry and the KBA."
"Deviations from this will not be accepted," said Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), according to the ministry.
VW has taken the guarantee that there will be no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance after the conversion and all vehicle type-approval values remain unchanged.
Volkswagen itself does not use the term "guarantee" as it was called in business circles.
With the broad term "guarantee", Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers, for example, could come to a workshop with engine damage half a year after the conversion - and this could be due to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
In the interests of the customer, it is also important to avoid any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust gas scandal, as it was said, leading to uncertainty about possible warranty arrangements.
Therefore, VW does not use the term "guarantee".
The Raiffeisenbank Gmund on Lake Tegernsee will require interest from wealthy savers in the future - as the second institute in Germany.
Bank chief Josef Paul said on Thursday: "It's only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on gyro or daily cash accounts."
The Federal Association of German Banks speaks of an individual case and sees no signal in it: normal savers should "not be afraid to pay for their savings interest".
If banks store money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay their 0.4 percent penalty rate.
This fee will be charged to Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September onwards by private and corporate customers for deposits of more than 100,000 euros in Giro or day money accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in the future," Paul said.
For some time now, he has been holding 40 million euros, which could be withdrawn from one day to the next and which he could not use.
“They’re in my central bank account and they’re incurring 0.4 percent of costs,” he said.
"I can't lay down for every million 4,000 euros."
The costs are now passed on according to the polluter principle.
Leaving the cash simply in the safes of the Raiffeisenbank would be far too dangerous: "I've already experienced four robberies, I don't like the fifth!" said the bank manager.
Most clients had understanding and switched to other forms of investment.
Few of them migrated to other banks.
The Bavarian Cooperative Association said: “The ECB’s extreme monetary policy rate causes considerable costs for all banks.”
Wearing them on their own is "not possible in a sustainable way".
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or transfers.
With penalty interest for deposits starting from three million euros, the Thüringer Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with its Skatbank branch in 2014.
Michael Kemmer, CEO of the Banking Association, said: "We do not expect that private customers will have to pay fees for deposits across the board, for this, the competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is far too strong."
A banker said there is "a clientele at Lake Tegernsee who is a little more lavish with the assets."
"This can become a problem for a small bank" if it guards free money.
Founded in 1911, the cooperative bank Gmund has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
Well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region.
The Bavarian Cooperative Association “is not currently aware of any other banks that charge an expense compensation for deposits by private customers,” said spokesman Ernst.
At the end of June, Uwe Fröhlich, president of the Bundesverband der Deutschen Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), declared: "The threshold to go negative towards the private customer is very, very high".
The competition is fierce, and it threatens to alienate investors to the competition.
Customers in Germany will not like this in its breadth.
Destination Records: Who's Buying Recordings?
Lonely middle-aged men love records.
Before rushing to the comment section to sow it under the pseudonym NotAllLonelyMenMiddle-aged with harsh insults, this statement derives from current data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed resurgence of records is not due to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia.
Those who have recently purchased a record are expected to be between the ages of 45 and 54.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.
It’s also not a horde of hobby collectors – it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers are more likely to keep their feelings to themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are the results of YouGov correct?
If this blog were a news report on television, the camera would follow me as I walk in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit and stalking wildly before standing, holding my hands and saying something decisive like, "Well, let's take a closer look at it."
So, let's take a look at it.
Even though Soho’s heart is slowly sinking in its charm – hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent vendors were based – there are still a handful of fantastic record specialty stores.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such stores and try to assess their age and mood by observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data number: eight middle-aged men, one woman, presumably around 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
“I guess so,” he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), decorate the walls of his living room.
The reason he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared and buy again items that he sold when he was young and broke.
“A lot of things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, that appeared when I was 11 or 12, things I was probably a little too young to buy me,” he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and like to spend time alone, adding, "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.
That's my loader.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets apply to the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and are tempted to buy their old records again.
From the conversations I have had, people have usually gotten rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records again,” he says.
This would explain the boom in adherents of plate revival of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional significance of records?
It only takes a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took a hit on the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers, objects that awaken happy youth memories.
“I think sometimes it can be filling a void or possessing material possessions as a kind of consolation,” says Wez.
This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is the case with many people.
It’s an easy way to get involved spiritually.
"We are like their social workers!" an employee flows from a pile of records.
An ICM survey in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a record last month haven’t listened to it yet.
The survey also found that 41% own a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not own a record player.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look very worried as I scroll through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data count: three middle-aged men), has noticed a “trophy aspect” of the revival.
“Someone just came in here recently and said, ‘I don’t own a record player, but I’d like to buy a Radiohead record so I can put it on the shelf,’” he says.
This is not a large percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product load, less music load.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older people, who come in slowly.
Fopp, who has dedicated almost an entire floor to the records, has a more colourful audience as I walk in.
There are couples around 70, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Even though the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the stores mentioned above - Wild Beast's latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz dripping from the speakers - it's good to see such diversity among customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but nagging mental traumas are hard to spot when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around the store for a few minutes, looking at the variety of plates for sale.
She's more of a shoplifter than a grocer.
She doesn’t earn much, so collecting records isn’t a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It’s easy to listen to music from a computer or any other way, but the beauty of records is..." she drifts off with a sigh of love.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I give the appearance of patterning the jeans hot pants, I observe a group of young teenage girls grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter consider buying a Crosley record player.
On the left is a staircase, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.
No one looks at them — perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far up that it is impossible to touch them.
It's pure "plate art".
But given that each attraction for these items means more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Soho for more, there’s nothing to complain about.
It’s no surprise that a population that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends the most on luxury items such as plates.
Although my research found that the results of YouGov are true, they do not take into account, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard at school or in offices.
They certainly don’t spend their Thursday morning strolling through Berwick Street record stores and leafing through records while avoiding the staring gaze of a creepy, 30-year-old false moderator who asks for nothing over the shoulders of middle-aged men.
The Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate - video report
Scientists say the Greenland shark has the longest lifespan of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says the record was in a female, which is believed to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long.
French court rejects offer to demolish shops in the jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais to tear down dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
At a court hearing this week, the Calais authorities argued that the state should be empowered to demolish 72 provisional shops where people inside the warehouse sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offering hairdressing services, or tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few restaurants.
The prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which carries a fire and sanitation risk.
Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the state-backed association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also argued that the temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people operating the 72 provisional businesses, but admitted that the prefecture of Calais’ concerns were “absolutely comprehensible.”
Judge Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just feeding people who “live in extremely precarious conditions.”
He said the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the demolition was the Jungle Book Kids' Café des Camps, which is run by non-profits and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.
A letter to the Guardian said the closure would be "a disaster for these children, the youngest of whom are eight years old."
The two aid organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to over 9,000 — the highest number to date — after a steep increase in new arrivals over the summer.
Despite Olympic Disappointment: Martin Remains Fighting
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympic time trial, professional cyclist Tony Martin does not want to be beaten.
"I will continue to keep an eye on the World Cup, remain confident and continue to fight," the 31-year-old wrote on Facebook on Thursday before leaving Rio de Janeiro.
He has no explanation for his miserable twelfth place on the sugar hat.
“I find it really hard to comment on yesterday’s time trial,” Martin said.
He had to calmly analyze what reasons would have led to the debacle.
At the time-driving World Cup in Qatar in October, Martin actually wanted to compete for the title.
“I’m going to look at everything we’ve changed lately.”
"That also counts my position," wrote the three-time time trial world champion, who had lost more than three minutes to Olympic winner Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland) on Wednesday on the 54.5 km.
Olympia: Tennis pro Siegemund misses semi-final
Laura Siegemund's victory move ended in the quarterfinals of Rio: The world-ranking 32nd from Metzingen missed by a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA-No.
34) the semi-final of the Olympic tennis tournament clearly.
Siegemund, who was plagued by back problems, was able to pass her stroke only once and seemed powerless compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday, Medal Hope Angelique Kerber (Kiel/No. 2) had the chance to jump into the preliminary round.
The Australian Open winner met the British Johanna Konta (No. 10).
As the last German tennis pro, Tommy Haas had won a silver medal in Sydney in 2000.
Two German DTB starters in the quarterfinals of summer games had last occurred in 1992.
There has never been a German duo in an Olympic singles semi-final.
Group grows in start-up for live video game broadcasts
Watching other people play video games is a huge trend - Microsoft wants to benefit from it too.
The technology group buys the start-up Beam, which specializes in this hobby.
How much money is flowing for the takeover, Microsoft did not say on Thursday.
Beam launched its offer only in January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others play, but also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give up missions to players and confront enemies as well as provide items of equipment.
Activision Blizzard launches a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook is supposed to help.
The advertising industry is already listening.
Employees of the start-up, which has its headquarters in Seattle, Washington, are moving to Microsoft’s headquarters in Redmond, California, according to Beam co-founder and chief executive Matt Salsamendi.
For the customers, therefore, nothing should be changed by the takeover.
According to Microsoft, Beam will be integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console.
The market of live streaming of video game activities is currently growing rapidly.
Well-known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was bought by online retailer Amazon in 2014 – for almost a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming is part of Google’s parent Alphabet.
Here comes the enforcement trailer
Germany’s racers have to adjust to the next generation of speedometers: In various federal states, including Hesse and Brandenburg, new lightning devices are being tested, which are to transfer temposünders particularly effectively.
The futuristic enforcement trailers of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, at accident centres where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, at motorway construction sites or to rehabilitating bridges with temporary speed limit, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with the speed limit there with a stationary flasher.
However, a permanent mobile setup can be too dangerous or expensive.
The Enforcement Trailer is self-contained: its battery lasts five days in continuous measurement operation, the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.
With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can be detected across multiple tracks at the same time.
Variable speed limits as well as driving bans by time, lane and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In the elevated condition, you can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with any car with trailer coupling.
In order not to simply be stolen, it is lowered in measuring operation, so that the wheels in the armored and, incidentally, bulletproof outer shell disappear.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is designed to protect the flasher from vandalism.
According to Vitronic, the trailer has been tested in various federal states since 2015 and is now also in use.
Foreign authorities are also flashing with the new technology: Recently, France has ordered 100 pieces, after an order of 150 pieces last year.
The United Kingdom is picking up silver in 7th Rugby after Fiji Masterclass gold
Britain’s impressive performance in 7th Rugby came to an abrupt halt in the final on Thursday night at the last hurdle in the form of Fiji, when they were beaten with a 43-7 result at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji awarded a master class in handling, side-stepping, backing, line running and raw power to win gold – its first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not-so-bad comfort prize of the silver medal – Britain’s fourth on that day – and they were quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear defeat of the boxers, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back on them in the final.
But regardless of this, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in best form in this form.
It might be a consolation for UK – but it probably won’t – that at least one Briton will have a gold medal hanging around his neck tomorrow: Fiji’s head coach Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult road ahead of them.
Eight years ago, they lost every game to Ryan at the Adelaide Sevens.
They only lost one here.
This slip will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji started out wonderfully and let the attacks GBs kick off from fun.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and Co., it felt as if you were running in buses, and the World Series winners went 5-0 up when Osea Kolinisau was cornered.
With another four minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner, which he converted.
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.
An outstanding tackle from Mitchell stopped man Leone Nakarawa's mountain from scoring a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua made a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the replay and there was still over a minute of playing time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvo pushed through further weak tackles of the GB team and stormed to the line to score a goal.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.
It’s as if Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.
That's the way it is.
GB made fundamental changes to the half time and closed the Fijian gap...for an entire four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half, until Joshua Tuisova passed after a brilliant interplay of Fiji.
Dan Norton started a try for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game has long been in favor of the South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced on the podium.
It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fiji.
Mata Viliame set the i-top with another attempt in the last seconds.
The bell rang, the Fijis hugged and GB kicked devastatingly hit the lawn.
Earlier that day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-final with 20-5 and the UK pushed South Africa in a narrow semi-final match from the race - Britain's conversion of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the boxing forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with impressive footwork and scored a goal under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackle by Marcus Watson, Anthony’s brother of the English 15-side team, secured the win – and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the coach to win the rowing
There will be no more emotional gold than in these games and that means something.
From the first rudder stroke to the last, 220 hard hives that go down in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional significance in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though it was only the two of them who were sitting on the helm, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of coach Robin Williams, was everywhere when they rode to the second Olympic gold in the row without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sport to set such a standard.
Their dominance was absolute, at least their 39th uncontested effort, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes gliding over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not fully reflect the kind of triumph.
Behind every gold in the rudder is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental advances that make the difference, and there was no one more helpful than the coach who 30 months ago did not know if he would survive that day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
Like he said, it was risky.
I had bladder cancer that is operable and they did.
If you don’t, it spreads everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the outlook a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were lucky to have been able to start treatment in early 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if under such circumstances that is at all the right term.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would suffice.
That's how it starts.
Rowing in itself is already a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.
In the immediate aftermath of the victory, her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking a little more than usual, trying to process his own fears.
Stanning, who served as a commander in the Royal Artillery Regiment in an operation in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week. It may be something extreme, but it means so much."
It just repeats how much that means to me, how much I and Helen and Robin have worked.
It was a fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anyone, so a huge thank you goes to him. He is the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t have asked for a better coach or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The pair had a hard rhythm that their opponents could not keep up with.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to open, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very trapped at the moment.
Helen called "stay in the process, stay in the process."
It is really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we were not about to do anything great.
We didn’t want fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, which we did.
The couple will take a year off before making decisions about their future.
Glover is due to appear at a wedding next week, her own with TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn’t want to say it was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London, it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic winner.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed out.
It took about four minutes.
It feels so much better," she said.
Provided for clarity for 31 years as an example
The managing director of the Wasserzweckverband "Veitensteingruppe", Ruppert Göller, is retiring.
The association is considered "exemplary throughout Bavaria".
A small Franconian drinking water association as a model for the large water producers.
This was stated some time ago in the original tone in a contribution of the Bavarian Broadcasting Corporation.
A little later, the Water Forum of the Government of Unterfranken recognized the purpose of the association.
The work of the Veitenstein group is considered "exemplary throughout Bavaria".
Behind all this is Rupert Göller, who worked for 31 years in the purpose association, of which 28 years as managing director.
He was retiring at the age of 65.
The drinking water purpose association of the Veitenstein group, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, promotes about 150000 cubic meters of water annually and supplies 32 places and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.
Member municipalities are the municipalities of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.
For other cities and municipalities, there are water supply contracts.
The current chairman, Breitbrunn Mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was appointed as a water guard in 1985 and was appointed as director of the purpose association in 1988.
“His tasks have been very diverse and they ranged from water pipeline construction and maintenance work to office and organizational activities, budgeting, calculating fees and contributions, to emergency deployments on weekends,” the chair said.
As outstanding events, she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells (1994), land purchases in the field of the new wells (1998) and compensation of farmers, the renovation of the high tanks (1999), the new acquisition of a central computer control (2004) and the partial renovation of water lines.
There has not been any downtime and there have always been innovations, because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her Laudatio, she praised Göller’s faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He has worked with a lot of heart for his water association and he has lived the water association as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein group for nitrate reduction in front of the Unterfranken district water forum.
He has received a lot of recognition and praise for this.
Rupert Göller, for his part, praised waterkeeper Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.
He is the best water guard and he was a loyal boy.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
From his point of view, he described the construction of the well and the restructuring of the purpose association as highlights.
However, the biggest challenge and the most difficult task was the pipe breaking at the high tank at Kirchlauter on January 3.
Here, at minus 17 degrees, they would have to work all night long so that the villages could be supplied with water.
The supply of Neubrunn could only be maintained once, because the high tank from Pettstadt was filled with hoses.
The management of the drinking water purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who succeeds Rupert Göller.
Soprano Anna Netrebko openly turns to her son Tiago's autism - and turns to other affected parents: "They must have the courage to talk about it."
"Medicine has made great progress," the 44-year-old told the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
When her son was diagnosed with the disease, she believed she had to die.
The now eight-year-old Tiago has made good progress and is now studying privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example: If I ask him something two years ago when I sang at the Milanese Scala, he remembers nothing," Netrebko said.
But he is the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection to the bass baritone Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship status in Bargteheide - Man shoots at partner
A 35-year-old man shot at his partner in a multi-family house in Bargteheide (Stormarn County) around 10.45 a.m. on Friday and fatally injured her.
“The man himself called us and stated that he shot his life partner,” a police spokeswoman said.
The perpetrator is on the run and is being publicly arrested.
Meanwhile nationwide, because Sven S. could be traveling by car.
The man is about 1.80 meters tall, muscular, brownish-burned and has a smooth.
Meanwhile, the police have released a photo of him.
However, it is a few years old.
In the meantime, the man is wearing a shoelace.
The man should not be addressed directly.
He could still carry the gun, the police said.
Anyone who sees Sven S. should call the 110.
The police speak of a “relationship state.”
The victim was born in 1988, the perpetrator in 1981.
The police in Lübeck initially did not want to give any information about the crime or the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim; however, they confirmed that one person had been killed.
"It's a crime of murder."
“We are not saying more at the moment,” said a police spokeswoman in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, a Special Operations Command (SEK) was at the scene.
Steel - Light View for German Steel Industry
The crisis-prone and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional costs in the millions.
Financial burdens that threatened the industry from the green energy funding are off the table.
The exemption from the renewable energy envelope for the so-called in-house electricity production facilities in the German steel industry will remain in effect, said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).
“I’m really happy that we were able to finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations.”
The European Commission initially planned to ask the steel manufacturers to use the gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.
According to the German Industry Association, the steel industry was facing additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.
Gabriel told the WAZ that there is now a principle agreement with the EU Commission after talks with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators in the steel works are replaced, an EEG charge of 20 percent will apply.
However, it is also not used in the steel industry.
IG Metall welcomed Germany’s agreement with the EU Commission on in-house power generation.
Thus, the status quo of the previous regime is largely fixed.
Gabriel’s successful efforts for the steel industry are of particular importance.
“In terms of our ‘Steel is the Future’ campaign, this is a first step.”
"Further must follow."
"In the reform of emissions trading, climate and employment targets must also be balanced," said IG Metall CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity and price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis.
Last year, the situation worsened further as the world’s largest producer country, China, threw massive amounts of steel into the world market in the face of weakening domestic demand.
European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel companies of price dumping.
Over the course of this spring, the situation has relaxed somewhat.
On the one hand, the imposition of import duties on imported steel has had an effect, and on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have brightened.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
German industry prime minister Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
Recently, prices have stagnated again.
The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp did not want to exclude closures of individual works.
At the end of 2015, around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry.
In July, German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
They produced 3.4 million tonnes of crude steel, well over six percent less than in the previous month, the economic association Stahl reported on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the quantity produced now declined for the second month in a row.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been two percent below the previous year’s level.
The association expects an increase in emissions in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation.
Community, Mind, Health: Singing is Good for Seniors
The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teacher’s study she took up music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
“Singing moves me – emotionally and physically,” she describes.
After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall more alive, she says.
In addition, she does something good for her health and her mind.
Singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German Seniorenliga.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, Hackler describes.
Through regular association, seniors are able to establish and maintain social contacts.
Because social and family structures often dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience Ursel Kipp has also made in her choir: "To agree and organize, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together".
Singing can be stressful in a positive sense, says Hackler.
This is because seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.
Those who regularly demand their lungs do not get out of breath so quickly even in everyday life.
Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.
Singing often has a very special effect on older people, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Working Group of Senior Organizations.
In the older generations, singing together had a much higher importance, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people arouses many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Through lyrics and especially melodies, even people with dementia remember long-standing events.
Singing also requires a special performance from the head, explains Lenz.
Concentrating on one’s own voice and on a given rhythm while adapting to the other singers is a great cognitive challenge.
Especially older people, who live alone, practice not only focusing on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition you get from singing in the choir, says Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
The self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.
Show yourself: If I practice for a long time for something, I will get better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.
There are good reasons to start singing, so there are enough.
Anyone who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, advises Lenz.
You can't sing alone - with 50 people singing, who can hear when a tone goes by?
In search of the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.
If someone from the circle of acquaintances sings in a senior choir, you can simply join.
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.
If you want to sing in a church choir, you can contact the congregation or the church leader directly.
Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.
If you do not have access to the Internet, you can ask your family, friends or neighbors for help in searching the Internet.
Anyone who wants to sing should definitely join a choir, advises Hackler.
Singing does the soul good and has something liberating - this applies to every age.
Cats react more sensitively than cats to cries of young animals
Biologists in Hannover have investigated the effect of calling cat babies on adult animals.
To their surprise, the miauen did not leave even the males cold - however, unlike the females, they always behaved the same.
Female cats can detect the degree of arousal of cat babies on the miao of the little ones.
They respond ten percent faster to sounds from kittens who are in great need, as scientists from the University of Veterinary Medicine and the Medical University of Hannover (MHH) have found out.
Cats also respond to the call of kittens - but always the same.
"Obviously, the acoustic differences between the meowing of less and highly aroused young animals are either not perceptible or not significant for the males," said Biologist Wiebke Konerding from the MHH.
She is the first author of the study, which was published this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology".
In a previous study, the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of kitten screams differs from the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult cats and eight kittens from the MHH animal husbandry were observed.
On the one hand, they were played by little ones who were taken out of the box for three minutes and separated from their mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with screams of more excited kittens, which were additionally raised.
The researchers consider their results to be meaningful despite the small sample.
"All the females, even those who did not yet have their own offspring, reacted differently to the screams," Konerding said.
They turned to the loudspeaker more quickly as this call played out the very excited kittens.
This ability may be congenital or develop with sexual maturity.
“One surprise was that the males reacted at all,” the biologist said.
In the past, scientists have repeatedly studied the reactions of women and men to baby noises in humans.
Also, some studies showed that women were more sensitive to infants, regardless of whether they were already mothers or not, the biologist Marina Scheumann reported.
Podolski takes on Supercup with "Gala"
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time after the coup attempt, an important football match is taking place in Turkey.
Before the duel of arch rivals Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolski's Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is announced.
Already when the state of emergency was imposed after the coup attempt in July, the government insisted that the everyday life of ordinary citizens should not be affected.
But this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed for the coup attempt.
There is no stopping the football either.
The prosecutor's office issued an arrest warrant against the former Starkicker Hakan Sükür.
According to him, the Sükur now living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sükür is said to be a follower of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt.
Although the state of emergency initially imposed for 90 days still applies until October, in fact, it has virtually no impact on the lives of most Turks.
The nocturnal “democracy guards” in public places across the country declared Erdogan to be finished on Wednesday.
The sport, like the whole country, is divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan.
Especially fans of the Besiktas workers' club are traditionally not among the friends of the president.
But what unites the bulk of the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military coups.
There even the fans agree - whether their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
With the cup winner "Gala" it will be especially again on Lukas Podolski.
The 31-year-old finished his first season as the club’s top scorer with 17 goals and nine appearances in all competitions.
In the final game against Fenerbahce, he scored the 1-0 victory.
The newspaper "Fanatics" cheered him: "He was the best in the place."
He finished the season in an excellent way and secured the cup for his team.
Thanks to "Poldi", the disappointing season for the record champion found a reconcilable conclusion.
After the preliminary round-up in the Champions League, the "Lions" also left early in the Europa League.
In the Super League it reached only 6th place.
The season was not good.
The cup was the only way to win.
"We have succeeded and that is the most important thing," Podolski said.
For Master Besiktas, the playing year went better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who with 26 season hits as the Super League goaltender king laid the foundation for the 14th title.
This is also the reason why fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
Gomez, who was under contract with AC Florence and was only loaned to Besiktas after the coup attempt, had announced that he would not return to the country after his European Championship holiday because of the political situation in the country.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," said club manager Fikret Orman.
To do this, the assailant would have to be willing to give up about a third of his estimated annual salary of 7.5 million euros, Orman clarified: "We cannot pay his salary at Florence".
Despite Doping: These Athletes Still Have Medal Chances at Olympia in Rio
Justin Gatlin, 34, has been banned twice for doping in 2001 and 2006.
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa is allowed to start in Rio nicht.
Other converted athletics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight for medals in Rio.
The topic of doping still determines the headlines at the Olympic Games in Rio.
The Russian swimmer Yulia Yefimova, who had sued for her starting right just before the games after a doping ban, was ruthlessly plowed out at her start (100 meters breast).
There was a strange scene: with a smile on her face, she was still proud in the hall and had provoked with her appearance.
When she realized she wasn’t going to get gold, the audience burst into a cheering storm.
But there are still many other athletes who, despite their doping record, are starting out at the Rio Olympics.
Here is an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m-staff/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.
He has already been banned twice for doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his bane, the 2004 Olympic champion and former world champion has run even faster than before, is over 100m in 9.80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the biggest challenger of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100-m-staff/Jamaica): The two-time Olympian and seven-time World Champion had to abstain from a six-month ban in 2010 after being shown taking the painkiller Oxycodon.
She had severe toothache after surgery, the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (discuss/Croatia): In 2011, the Olympic winner of 2012, World Champion of 2013 and European Champion from 2010 to 2016 tested positive for the banned stimulant methylhexanamine.
Perkovic denied knowingly taking it and was suspended for six months.
The four widest rolls this year go to the account of the big gold favorite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400 m relay/USA): The Beijing Olympic winner and two-time world champion over 400 m, had been tested positive in 2010 and was suspended for 21 months.
A means of penis enlargement was responsible, Merritt said.
This year, the 30-year-old over 200 and 400 m is the fastest man in the world to date.
Ivan Tichon (Hammerwurf, Belarus): Hardly a single athlete was subsequently deprived of so many medals.
Tichon lost his 2005 World Cup title nine years later after he was diagnosed with testosterone doping.
The now 40-year-old also had to give away Olympic silver in 2004 due to steroid doping and the 2006 European Championships due to testosterone abuse.
He also won the bronze medal at the 2008 Olympic Games, following a ruling by the International Court of Justice CAS.
At 80.04 m, he ranks second in the world rankings.
Liu Hong (20 km Walking, China): The world record holder and gold favourite was tested positive only in May, but is still allowed to start in Rio.
In the 29-year-old world champion, evidence of taking a banned dietary supplement was found, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) lockdown fell mild and expired as early as July 13.
Bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian woman injured - Multiple dead
The Austrian embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, Foreign Ministry spokesman Thomas Schnöll said Friday morning.
She suffered cuts and was treated in the hospital, but was able to leave it again.
She planned her trip home for the beginning of September.
Whether further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket, as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon, also affect Austrian citizens, remains unclear for the time being.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities in this regard, according to Schnöll.
In Hua Hin, about 200 kilometers south of the capital Bangkok, two bombs were first detonated on Thursday night in an outlying district.
According to police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday morning, two explosives went up again, in which, according to the authorities, another person was killed.
A bomb explosion was also reported from Phuket in the early hours.
According to police, a taxi driver was injured in the detonation near the beach Patong, which is popular with holidaymakers.
In Surat Thani on the southeast coast of the country, another bomb exploded that killed an urban employee.
According to authorities, the explosives were blown up in a flowerbed in front of the coastal police area.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast and in Chumphon on the southeast coast caused several injuries.
It is believed to be related to the explosions in Hua Hin.
"The bombings bear the same handwriting," Army General Danai Kritmethavee told reporters Friday morning.
“We believe that this is a coordinated attack.”
It’s too early to comment on possible motives – but it’s probably the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to identify a pattern in the attacks that is typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
Thai police, on the other hand, said the attacks were not related to the Islamist insurrection movement or international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage, which is limited to limited areas and provinces," a spokesman in Bangkok said.
Instead, it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.
The authorities had received intelligence reports in recent days of impending attacks in the south of the country - but they had not been informed of the exact time and locations.
It is unclear which group is behind the attacks.
The police instructed their officials across the country to increase security around key government buildings as well as airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
In Thailand, there are always smaller bombings, but they are usually not aimed at tourists.
In Hua Hin is a palace that has been used for years by King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand.
After the bombings, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.
High security risk (Security Level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings.
After clashes between security forces and Muslim populations, travel to these provinces is discouraged before not necessary.
Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday came a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
This gives the military a great deal of influence in the coming years.
Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to wreak havoc as the country moved toward stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.
The military junta, which came to power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, believes it is in its own interest to have restored the kingdom to stability and order.
However, the military has also failed to seize the insurrection of Muslim rebels in the far south of the country that has been raging for years.
More than 6,500 people have been killed in the conflict.
Nearly a year ago, 20 people were killed in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine in Bangkok, most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack in the country’s recent history.
The right-wing "Identitarian Movement" has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
After several state offices, the constitutional defenders in the federal government also put the group under observation.
"We see at the 'Identitarian Movement' indications for efforts against the liberal democratic basic order," said Hans-Georg Maaßen, head of constitutional protection of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Thus, immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are defamed in an extremist way.
That’s why we’re watching the movement now.
The "Identitarian Movement" is a group with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012.
It opposes "multicultural delusion", "uncontrolled mass immigration" and the "loss of one's own identity through alienation".
Constitutional protectors in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - are already watching the "identitaries".
Maaßen said his authority had closely coordinated with the state offices in the decision.
"Groups like the 'Identitarian Movement' are trying to pick up their target group where they stand," the head of constitutional protection said.
In general, extremists try to address them with youthful language, often with pop music.
This is what Islamists do, as well as right-wing extremists.
This is not advertising for your own sake.
Propaganda should appeal to people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable there.
That's dangerous.
Recently, there had been reports from several federal states about contacts of the "identitarians" with AfD politicians.
Maaßen said he had no knowledge of this.
For constitutional protection, possible contacts of this type are only relevant from a certain point.
It depends on whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - changes its targeting by certain individuals who are extremists and becomes so extremist.
It is therefore crucial whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This is not recognizable.
Given the significant increase in legally motivated crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee accommodation, Maaßen said he would not yet speak of new right-wing terrorism in this context.
But we have found in recent years that there can be right-wing terrorist structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freitaler group.
It may well be that other right-wing terrorist groups or minority groups are forming that plan attacks on asylum seekers, on refugee homes or on attacks from other right-wing extremist motives.
However, a German-wide or European-wide control of right-wing terrorism is not recognizable.
The previous groups were formed at the regional level or in social networks.
M<0xC3><0xA5>aßen expressed concern that many attacks were carried out on the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right-wing scene.
That's what's troubling.
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum accommodations had not previously been known to be criminals, politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right-wing scene.
"So many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who may have been politically indifferent or, for example, elected the CDU, SPD or the left, who then radicalized themselves through right-wing extremist sentiments."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habe becomes an Internet hit
It is not always the Olympic Games or world records that determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.
This is shown by the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habe at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.
At the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he was temporarily no longer seen in the TV pictures.
He simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected.
In social networks, Habte subsequently became a viral Internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old finished his run with a 48-second gap and finished 59th out of 59 starts.
But it was rather his not exactly sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media.
Why is the 24-year-old still participating in the Olympics?
The Ethiopian received a special starting right from the International Swimming Federation.
This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries more popular.
Since most athletes run in Ethopia, Habte just wanted to do something different.
Preparation is everything: Robel Kiros Habe is getting ready for the big race.
The first nicknames quickly made the round.
Some media referred to it as the "Robel of the Whale".
In response to a "prosperity belly", the English Boulevard newspaper "The Sun" with "Dad Bod" made fun of him.
His time, he hit only with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters freestyle, did not matter.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
At the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Eric Moussambani's run attracted media attention.
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to compete in a run over 100 meters freestyle alone.
Moussambani was fired at the time.
The 22-year-old only learned to swim eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.

Geretsried - The owner of a shop at Neuen Platz has been robbed.
According to police, the 67-year-old rider had left her business on Monday around 5.30 pm and forgot to close a window on the ground floor.
When she returned the next morning at around 8.15 am, about 250 euros had disappeared from the box office.
Traces of the perpetrator could not be found.
There is also no video surveillance.
Trump does not see the impending election defeat as narrow
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at an election campaign event in Florida.
If there is nothing wrong with the election of the US president, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
He is going on vacation.
If Donald Trump loses the US presidential election in November, he wouldn’t care: “Ultimately it’s either going to work out, or I’m having a very, very nice, long vacation,” the Republican candidate said in a telephone interview with the US television station CNBC.
If it’s not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that’s okay, Trump said.
He named US President Barack Obama and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton as the founders of the Islamic State (IS) terror group.
Within his party, there has been more and more resistance.
Post enters the trade with electric transporters
An electric delivery vehicle from Deutsche Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the vehicle is obviously high.
The Post also plans to sell its electric vehicle StreetScooter.
Soon, the Group intends to start trading in the transporter.
The Post wants to offer its electric transporters on the free car market from next year.
"We want to enter into the sale to third parties," a post spokesman said on Friday.
The company has been considering whether to sell its self-developed StreetScooter, which will deliver letters and packages, to other companies for months.
Post-CEO Jürgen Gerdes had said that there are always demands, for example from craftsmen.
According to information from the news magazine "Der Spiegel", the Bonn Group will soon enter mass production of the vehicles.
In post-production, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift.
Gerdes had announced that the Group would significantly expand its fleet of electric cars and plan a complete transition to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term.
“We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020,” he said at the end of July.
I can imagine we're changing the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on the roads of Germany since 2014.
GfK management resigns after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK replaces its boss Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came all of a sudden, but not surprisingly.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK suggested that the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann will become the more uncertain the longer the successes promised by him are absent.
Turbulences at the head of the Nuremberg market research company GfK: After disappointing business figures and the resignation of the company management, the global number five of the industry is facing a new beginning of personnel.
The CEO of GfK wants to leave the company by the end of the year.
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board, Arno Mahlert, has already left the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September.
As of September 1, the management board will be headed by Gerhard Hausruckinger, a former member of the board of directors, the company said.
He is to officially take on the role of a "Board Spokesman" until a successor for Hartmann is found.
As a reason for the resignations, the company called "different views" on the long-term direction of business policy.
A company spokeswoman did not want to give details on Friday.
Who will lead the market research company in the future is still unclear at the moment.
In investor circles, it was said on Friday that the shareholder’s disappointment about the continued failure of the restructuring initiated years ago was great.
Mr. Hartmann has been at the forefront of GfK since 2011.
"But the fruits of the restructuring are not yet visible even after 5 years," it said.
In view of the recent poor GfK business figures, every shareholder will become restless at some point.
"If that were the case with BMW, the Quandts would do the same," he said.
The company had not been able to stop its loss drive after setbacks in the previous quarters, even in the second quarter of 2016.
At <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>361.2 million, sales were 6.1 percent lower than in the same quarter of the previous year.
Compared to the first half of the year, sales decreased by 3.4 per cent by EUR 721.2 million.
Earnings in the second quarter were mainly burdened by the company’s declining value in view of its difficult economic situation.
The company’s depreciation of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>139 million, which became necessary in the Consumer Experience business unit, resulted in a loss of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>148.2 million.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK generated a consolidated profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus slips in Krummhörn in Graben: Eight injured
In a bus accident with 43 seniors as passengers, eight people were injured on Thursday in Krummhörn (Aurich district).
Two of the inmates suffered serious injuries, the police said.
According to her, the 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach had to avoid a hitchhiker, who was partly on the opposite track.
The bus came off the road to the right and slipped into a ditch, as a police spokeswoman Aurich/Wittmund reported.
"Due to the location of the bus, the people could not leave the bus independently," she said.
The fire brigade liberated the inmates.
Six ambulances and an ambulance arrived at the scene of the accident on Landstraße 2.
The uninjured passengers were transported by a line bus back to the district of Pewsum in Krummhörn.
There they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company.
The investigators asked the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police.
The fees per cubic meter of sewage are from 1 October 2016 for the area of the Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl sewage system 3.44 euros instead of 2.10 euros; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3.36 euros (previously 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3.64 euros (previously 2.18 euros).
At the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary.
According to a superficial calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic meter.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, when the budget was approved by the Landratamt Kulmbach, it was found that there were undercovers for these wastewater plants.
The Kasendorf market is obliged, on the basis of legal bases, to operate the plants cost-effectively.
As of 1 October 2016, citizens and commercial and industrial enterprises from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the purse.
Fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.
As Managing Director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the Board, a recalculation of the fees for the wastewater systems of the market community was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- and under-covers from the previous calculation period should also be offset.
The serious fee increases are based on the fact that all three wastewater systems are relatively small facilities with a very low wastewater intake, which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.
For example, due to the low distribution base, costs for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.
In addition, the level of wastewater in all three plants is slightly decreasing.
In addition, in the previous calculation period, all three plants have incurred a considerable amount of refurbishment and repair costs, not least because of their age.
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that in the Azendorf sewage system the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage.
At the Welschenkahl pumping plant, the almost 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be completely overhauled and at the Lopp pond treatment plant, after almost 20 years of operation, the first sewage pond had to be excavated, the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation facility could be installed to maintain the water regulations in the future.
Schmidt: "These extraordinary expenses were accompanied by the continued maintenance and maintenance costs, which are to be taken into account accordingly in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which in the previous calculation in the years 2011/2012 were still well below the current level.
Steinhäuser made it clear that in the event of a low level of wastewater in the three plants, the costs for operation and maintenance will "full blow through".
Schmidt added that the market community has been spared the last 20 years from large entertainment costs at the wastewater treatment plants.
According to Steinhäuser, the situation for these plants will continue to be precarious in the long term, especially since the supply area of the wastewater association Friesenbachtal cannot be extended to include these plants because they are deficient facilities.
Bulgaria reports inflation for the first time in 8 months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July was 1% on a monthly basis.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first above zero since October last year when positive 0.2% were recorded.
The average annual inflation for the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was measured according to the CPI -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, compared to the previous month, the following groups of consumer goods increased in price: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and footwear (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routine maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained unchanged as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; as well as education.
Snapchat "Anime" Effect Criticized as Asian Cartoon
Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.
With its filtering tool, Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in a way that already borders on the absurd.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog, or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are unflowered, property-rotating tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All missteps go to the public.
Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past, accusing them of promoting blackface or white skin as a beauty ideal.
When it proposed to some users this week a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and swollen cheeks, some critics called it a racist cartoon of Asians - "yellow face".
They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and outrage spread widely on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced it had disabled the feature.
The company offered an excuse: the filter was meant as a tribute to anime characters and not as a cartoon of Asians.
But outsiders who have experienced racism, the filter reminded of hurtful clichés.
Others strongly rejected the anime comparison.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets about the photos were widely circulated, wrote that the filter was “injurious and mildly said to be unpleasant.”
She added that "it's difficult to argue with the contrast of a very disgusting Asian cartoon and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellow-face has been pulled into the devaluing extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural stumbling blocks.
American culture seems to be engaged in an endless struggle for diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat’s large audience of young people — who are more diverse in terms of race than their older counterparts — might be more likely to expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat’s filters generates an image that is offensive to a user, “so it’s much harder for such things to go unnoticed than it used to be,” 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account, prompting others to do the same.
In an essay for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believes racial controversies reflect a lack of diversity in Snapchat’s hiring practices.
Zhu criticized the largely white, male-only leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
“Either they don’t have a diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so they can make such decisions,” said the Chinese-American Zhu, “or they have people with other skin colors who work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say anything about it.”
Others share their opinion, a complaint that has left Snapchat largely unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees, but according to a spokesperson, the company has recently hired a HR manager who focuses on underrepresented populations and internal integration efforts.
Zhu, meanwhile, said she will close her Snapchat account and added, “I wonder if they need more users like us to be able to say that’s not OK.”
Military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence, Congressional committee finds
Military members of the United States Central Command altered intelligence information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed, a congressional committee of inquiry reported in a report Thursday.
The preliminary report, compiled by a task force of Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee, and the Defense Budget Committee, reported great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors made their assessments of U.S. efforts in the fight against Islam.
The Central Command, or Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“News service information, typically nicked by high-ranking Centcom commanders, regularly drew a more positive picture of U.S. counter-terrorism efforts than actual on-site conditions would have allowed, and was consistently more positive than analyses by other news services,” a newspaper article quoted the report as saying.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The leadership flaws in Centcom reach to the top of the organization.
The ten-page report shows in detail persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi armed forces.
While it does not provide direct evidence that Obama administration spikes have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts viewed themselves under pressure from their precepts to draw a more optimistic picture of the Islamic State threat, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
“During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements, and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than it actually is,” the report said.
For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city, remains under Islamic State control.
"After months of investigations, so much is clear," Mike Pompeo, a Republican congressman from Kansas, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 through mid-2015, Central Command leaders changed intelligence reports to play down the danger posed by ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans launched the task force after they were told that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports about the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be supplemented by more detailed findings as the investigations continue.
In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Defense are underway.
Democratic members of the intelligence committee released their own findings on Thursday, which were consistent with some of the Republican Task Force’s findings.
“In 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an excessively limited process for making intelligence assessments of ISIL and Iraqi security services,” said Adam B. Schiff, a senior Democrat on the committee, in a statement.
This process, Schiff said, "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," damaged the morale among analysts, and "gave way too little room for divergent opinions."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they had found no evidence of White House interference with Centcom analysts regarding a “certain political opinion.”
The preliminary results of the congressional investigations were published by The Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported on investigations by the Pentagon inspector general, which were opened following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on congressional reports while the Inspector General’s investigations were still ongoing.
But he also stated that "experts sometimes have quite diverging opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the defense ministry welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense."
The investigations have had repercussions on the issue of a successful U.S.-led air campaign in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Department of Defense).
However, last year’s accusations raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
Criticism of Islamic State secrecy is reminiscent of disputes more than a decade ago when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a paper on how the then-government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, provided only a small crew in Iraq to deal with the situation and little time after that.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting on the Islamic State.
Last year, the team around Mr. Hooker found, according to government officials, that contrary to the government’s statements, airstrikes on the refineries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the terrorist group’s financial situation, as these provisional refineries had taken up operations to sell oil on the black market.
However, this finding was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcom’s then-commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a Senate hearing.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel in the Central Command.
USA win fourth match in women's field hockey, a showdown with Great Britain is about
One day after scoring three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also scored the first two goals for the American women's field hockey team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0.
Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable feat, but Bam (27) said she couldn’t remember having ever done that.
"I don't know," she said.
I'm not one of those people who keeps their doors in their memory.
However, she knows this: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the British in first place, who remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two within their group of six teams will achieve first and second place respectively.
The first-place finisher will go a little longer out of the way for the strong Dutch women who lead the other group.
Whatever the game may be on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising whirlwind through their success story, four years after they landed in the last of 12 places at the past London Games.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and first held a hockey bat at the age of three (their two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), at the age of 16 she became the U.S. national player, the youngest in the team's history.
She missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the squad.
Then came the year 2012, when everything went wrong for her and her team.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became coach of the national team and so things began to turn for the better.
“A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change,” Bam said.
We didn’t have the work plan in London that we have now.
We were able to tear the rudder completely.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the Torreys in the first half of the game with a backhand blow from the near range.
India had gone into the game without a win in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and held the stand from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.
She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved in the middle and jumped the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.
The Shutout was the first of the entire tournament for U.S. goaltender Jackie Briggs, who had to score one goal in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good position," Parnham said, but how well will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday.
In the midst of the rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampoline
Wherever you are, however late it is, it is the Olympic Games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable, a raging season between competition and striving.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, ranging from the armpit shooter to the swimmer to the turner to the triathlete.
You can’t turn on the TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor’s conversation in the queue at the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the fight between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is at the Olympics for the first time and a women's swarm with dimples, could have been quite under these well-known names, which are sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising, if he were a swimmer, turner or even fan.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampoline tours.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event the same way.
Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognized: air gun shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have the breasts swimming and may it reign for a long time.
But if I should modestly make arguments for my particular favorite, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it debuted in Sydney, it has been perceived so sparsely for the past 16 years that many of the people I had interviewed did not know it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the U.S. sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and until 2012 had an athlete who made it to the final round.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for men and the Chinese and the Canadians for women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampoline jumping has a certain outside charm, partly because it sounds more appropriate for a clown school than that for the Olympic Games.
At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but just an earthbound enthusiast.
It has humorous potential - the cardboard-like tremor of its never-ending impact - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that essentially unite it.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as "springboard."
Aspiring winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and need a series of falling moves (turns, hooks and jumps) before landing on their feet.
They are evaluated according to the official Olympic program by execution, difficulty and "flight time".
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight.
Medal-seekers need to go further, faster, up and over, sometimes to the finish line, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.
They are not only chasing the finish line or the starting wall, but in television broadcasting they are also chasing another lofty goal: that of the world or the Olympic record.
The purposeful pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical – and it is enough to move even a spectator to tears.
But it’s also what I find tiresome when I watch these games myself.
Of these, the trampoline offers a breathtaking break.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is above.
Moving forward is not the goal.
He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.
Here too there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no bulging in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It’s as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be.
The women’s qualifying and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men’s on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days starting at 14.00.
In the midst of the Olympian mania, they promise a quiet, pleasant moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general tumult.
If awareness-raising can only be achieved by targeting and objectifying male athletes — as the male U.S. gymnasts recently suggested, according to The Wall Street Journal — then Mr. Dooley is expecting his air-to-air, new fanbase.
"One generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators calling for political change in Ethiopia were met with violent resistance from the government.
Witnesses say that ten protesters were killed during clashes with police during gunfire.
Is Ethiopia about to collapse?
In the last ten years, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, protests against the government have shaken the country and spread to more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people stormed the streets demanding fundamental political change.
The government’s response was ruthless, according to human rights organizations.
Witnesses said police shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.
Videos of the protests, which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security guards beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Office is now requesting an in-depth investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
After Nigeria, Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.
U.S. military and intelligence agencies are working closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats beyond the region, particularly in Somalia. Few countries in Africa, if any, receive so much Western aid.
Ethiopia’s economy expanded at a considerable pace.
Its infrastructure has improved drastically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy – human rights organizations have consistently led government repression – the opposition in the country has been curtailed, effectively silenced by dissidents.
Many were sent into exile or prison, killed or driven into the vastness of the desert.
But that could change.
“If you oppress people and they have no other options but to protest, it breaks out,” said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia.
The whole youth is protesting.
A generation is protesting.
There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to wrestling in relation to the power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea; a fight for this sloppy, controversial line claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, could exploit the turbulence and re-arm themselves.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness now explode after years of simmering beneath the surface.
The first one seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have very many Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones became more common and Internet services improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, especially during protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide where they are staying.
A number of young Ethiopians said they were gathering to protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
For eons, the Amharas, who come from predominantly Christian highlands in Ethiopia, prospered in politics and economics while exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in shallow lands.
But that is also changing right now.
"We are in the process of coordinating under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The largest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromo.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which make up about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third cause of the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death from an undisclosed illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.
Analysts say he was particularly proficient in detecting early signs of dissatisfaction and using special agents to manipulate opponents and make them harmless.
“The current regime lacks this basic skill,” said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia’s new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, has been selected for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of North Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tigray.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a turmoil was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections that, according to analysts, were seemingly flogged by the government and subsequently stolen.
During the subsequent raids, many protesters were killed, although there were fewer than in recent months and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia’s leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal malice of the Ethiopian government.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters attacked businesses run by Tigray in Gondar, an Amharic city, and hatred of the Tigray is becoming more common on social media.
Analysts say the protests put the US and other Western allies in a peculiar position.
The U.S. government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it had closed that base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin ridge walk."
Donald Trump Says Obama Founded ISIS Was ‘Sarcasm’
Donald J. Trump tried on Friday to dispel the latest controversy surrounding his campaign by stating that his repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the Islamic State terrorist group was not meant to be serious.
This clarification raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and intelligibly with the American public.
It also brings his fellow contestants, who are trying to protect him during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position of having to declare statements that he could not have meant at all.
After making the suggestion at an election campaign event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump backed down on Thursday’s allegation, insisting in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.
The tweet was the opposite of the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he thought the accusation was completely serious.
When conservative radio presenter Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate didn’t want to know about it.
The latest storm of criticism is slamming down on Mr. Trump as he has tried to steer his campaign’s focus on the economic situation due to falling survey values.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to the issue again.
Reporting via Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton’s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already presented sarcasm in his defense.
At the end of July, he drew strong criticism when he thought the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton’s emails, but he later declared, “Of course I meant that sarcastic.”
This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the language boundaries in politics and then row back as needed.
“I think it’s one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive, and then if necessary “clear up” depending on how the response goes,” said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who observes the language of both candidates.
But I also think he’s smart enough to keep his statements vague enough so they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of discouraging the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more corrosive tone as his polling has declined further.
A new poll by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed a lead with great lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to have to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or mistaking his humor.
But while he is increasingly in the spotlight in the final months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump’s jokes have brought his loyal co-workers into the uncomfortable situation of having to stand up to him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former mayor of New York and one of Trump’s most prominent advocates, struggled to defend the candidate in a CNN interview on Thursday.
“I think what he says is legitimate, political comments,” Giuliani said, so he was asked about the correctness of Mr. Trump’s statements as to whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backbenchers, completely wrong and that’s why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread by failing to aggressively control the situation in the Middle East.
Before the Pennsylvania campaign on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media, accusing them of riding around on each of his words and being biased against him.
He mocked the “poor, pathetic” TV experts trying to understand him and said, “You can’t!”
Some Democrats mocked Mr. Trump’s apology as just another proof that he was unsuitable for the presidency.
Once pushed above the price from the market, cafe comes back in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby cafe in Williamsburg where you could only pay for cash that didn’t have Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices pushed him out of his Bedford Avenue storefront.
The Soap Cherie business, which replaced the verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals mourned it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.
Artist Molly Crabapple tweeted, “I know New York is change, but I still can’t believe CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel except and Verb is now a soap business.”
But if New York is a change, then it is also a new invention.
A revitalized verb cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old café, who is the owner and managing director of the new café.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.
When a customer offered him to provide funds for a new outpost, he was excited to do so, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept up a lot.
Verb used the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment too.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishes such as capers and sautéed onions.
There are natural rice bowls.
The café no longer serves beer, but there are fresh juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.
“Many old customers have also been displaced by prices from Williamsburg,” he said.
Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and regularly visited the verb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take the road on her own.
After the verb closed, she gave up drinking coffee for a while, she said.
“I realized that it was coffee and culture in the verb that I liked,” she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even though she ordered a blended chai tea instead of her usual iced coffee that day, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-time and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before work and inevitably always ordered the same thing.
“I came quarter to seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they’re preparing my everything bagel with butter,” he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he replaces his everything bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he had no qualms about the soap business taking over the old business premises.
In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for verbs with the coffee's cold brewed as an ingredient.
"I think we're going to go over her offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoints have also accepted the café.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he intends to exhibit it soon so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
The location also has other advantages.
A local juice shop wants to fill the cold brewed coffee into a bottle and sell it.
There is a chance that the cafe will expand to a neighboring building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the floor when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee felt like a return home.
"I had to smell that," he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a plentiful meal"
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch in the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a weakness for refined Fifth Avenue delicacies such as P<0xC3><0xA2>te de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu on that day was a little more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato puree and as a dessert a plum pudding.
“It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people,” said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, “It was also a message to Americans how to eat.”
The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coe's last book "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in the US, while Ziegelman tells about living in a residential house on the Lower East Side from a food perspective in her book "97 Orchard".
Their latest collaboration, “A Decent Meal,” which will be published Tuesday at Harper Publishing House, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at Eisenberg’s Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, slender snack in the Flatiron District that has been in business since the 1929 stock market crash.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with pieces of olives, while Coe, 57, ate turkey with potato puree and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered hackbraten, this pair found it appropriate for a discussion about eating in the era of the Great Depression.
“Rich foods were very popular,” Ziegelman said.
There was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.
They were prepared from one ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.
Coe grinned.
“It must have been like lead in the stomach,” he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table in an American household, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and it was served freshly baked pasta for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War. "A Square Meal" records the ways that the country dealt with being no longer the land of snails.
“It was a time when food became a central, tense topic for Americans,” Coe announced why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was just as tense: mysterious foods like bread and casseroles became staple foods that recycled casseroles as “a wonderful way to recycle food leftovers,” Ziegelman noted, as chefs were able to hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which has been the focus of American cuisine for years, has become a rare luxury served.
Unique blends have been tried, as a high-calorie and nutritious satisfaction took precedence over taste or even common sense.
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this era, baked onions with peanut butter.
“It wasn’t a popular addition at lunchtime,” Coe says.
Steinmann goes on to say, “It was surreal.”
Peanut butter and baked onions do not match.
It was typical for many of the household recipes.
As never before or since, household economists—including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943—drive the country’s eating habits in such a way.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become “budget politicians” and meet the challenge of turning pampas like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a festival of historical treats.
Especially tasty are the reports of the government’s response to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover’s lass-mich-kuchen-Essen-Haltung.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farm kitchen of his kitchen, he ate like the million-dollar man of the world he has become.
“He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce,” Coe said.
He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a tuxedo.
He was splendidly alienated from reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not asked him to make an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, the hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in Mrs. Roosevelt's tastes led the White House to produce the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most uncomfortable prepared."
Many of the species from the era of the Great Depression, dealing with food, were discarded as soon as the land came back on its feet.
The legacy lies in our continued focus on calories and food, Ziegelman said, as well as how science has been applied to food.
The couple claimed to have better understood the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law when writing the book - for example, how she couldn't throw away food.
“She had a real fear of wasting food,” Coe said.
Ziegelman remembered, "She actually made people sick."
There was the windbag incident.
After the plates were cleaned at Eisenberg's, she and Coe prepared a dessert they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate at lunch.
"It's called Prune Whip," said Ziegelman, adding that it was a common trick to miss modest recipes a chic name.
There was no whipped cream, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly dipped a spoon into the tough brown glibber.
Surprisingly, it didn’t taste bad.
Coe got a referral three times.
As a can-do budgeter, he told his wife, “A couple of chopped walnuts would help.”
Killed in bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life at risk to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save the lives of others.
Now the 30-year-old has died himself in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the White Helmets, a civil protection group that has saved nearly 60,000 lives so far.
2,900 volunteers are putting their own lives at risk to pull people out of bombed-out homes and to provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: A video of the civil defender showing him in an 11-hour rescue of an infant from the rubble of a house went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian a shining symbol in the horrors of war.
However, as a hero he never saw himself, according to the picture, he said: "For me, this is the real jihad."
“When I die saving lives, I think God sees a martyr in me.”
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he had spoken in a video about the latest bombings in Syria.
The helicopters dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one of which was filled with chlorine gas.
One woman and two children died, seven people suffered from respiratory distress.
"We are now removing the toxic remains of the bomb so that children do not play with it," the picture quotes his last words before he died.
The Assad regime’s deadly bomb was supposed to hit terrorists.
Greenland shark: the oldest vertebrate animal is almost 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.
This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation aboard the research ship Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - to this day.
Greenland sharks only get offspring at 150 years of age.
The Greenland shark swims slowly along the bottom of the North Atlantic, reaching an average of just 1,220 meters in an hour.
Only when it comes down to it, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to a whopping 2.6 km/h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.
However, this slow-moving lifestyle seems to be a patent recipe for a very old age.
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" in any case of a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.
“Insanity,” comments Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, commenting on this lifespan, which means a world record for vertebrates.
Evolutionary biologists have long suspected that Greenland sharks are becoming stone-aged.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the ice sea off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear on the surface in winter.
Accordingly, researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.
They measured their tempo when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitzbergen.
In the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.
Possibly they hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice sea, looking for carcasses that bleed down from higher layers of water.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland sharks, which fishermen caught from the depths of the North Atlantic between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Spitzbergen.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest was 502 centimetres long.
To determine the age of the animals, they used the carbon-14 method to analyze the lens core of the sharks.
This center of the eye lens is created before the birth of the shark, the proteins contained in it are not renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had strikingly much carbon-14 in the lens core.
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons experiments pushed larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
However, in the third smallest animal with a length of 220 centimeters, the lens core contained a small excess of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests, it is believed to have celebrated its 50th birthday during its investigation in 2012.
All the larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal amounts of carbon-14 in their lens core, which is generated by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon 14 watch for a 493-centimeter-long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record-breaking 502-centimeter-long shark was likely even 392 years old.
It was known that Greenland shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters.
Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.
Since one of the animals at 392 centimetres was probably on the threshold of sexual maturity and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland sharks can obviously breed for at least one and a half centuries.
This, too, is currently a world record for vertebrates.
That such methuselahs live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale with a 120-year-old harpoon tip on its neck, was also caught in front of Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on fire.
So they ripen later - and age more slowly.
In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals also often become particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal absorbs heat.
The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much greater than that of a gram of elephant.
Another advantage is that you have fewer enemies.
"So a smaller animal lives more dangerously and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as early as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should rather invest its resources in a long life.
Building plot in double pack
In the recent meeting, the municipal council focused on issues related to construction.
With relief, the Board accepted the announcement from Mayor Robert Putz that "the marketing of the recently designated residential areas can finally begin".
After the land, parcelling and development issues were clarified and the applications for surveying could be made, nothing stands in the way of the sale of the land in the residential areas "Straßlweg" and "Schönau-West" (Binderstraße - expansion section 1) to interested parties.
The municipal council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau are equally appealing to young families and anxious seniors.
As it was said, construction workers can report to the town hall from now on, about the award of the plots is expected to consult the municipal council in its September meeting.
In order to also be able to comply with requests for the establishment of other commercial enterprises, associated with the creation of jobs, the municipal council decided to amend the land use plan, which was newly created only in the spring of this year, in sub-areas.
Thus, in the area of Unterzeitlarn, the commercial area already designated there is extended by two parcels towards the State Road 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The City of Main has the best chances of attracting jobs and companies relocated from London in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.
“Frankfurt is very likely to benefit the most from the Brexit vote,” says Michael Voigtländer, head of the IW’s financial and real estate markets competency field.
After the Brexit referendum, it is unclear whether money houses will be allowed to operate further from London from financial transactions throughout the EU.
To date, the so-called EU Passport is sufficient for them to be admitted in the UK.
This is currently being used by major US banks.
Several banks have already announced that they are moving jobs.
The lobby association "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects 10,000 new jobs on the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, according to the IW, the headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB), which unites responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisory Authority (EIOPA) and the ESRB Risk Board (ESRB).
While the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is headquartered in Paris, it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
“The proximity to the central bank is important for banks because they can communicate directly with the supervisory authorities,” says IW Professor Voigtländer.
Although Luxembourg was home to a large sector of funds, Dublin and the infrastructure sector were doing less well.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
In addition, the city scores with readily available commercial properties.
“In Paris it is not so easy to find free high-quality offices,” says Voigtländer.
On the Seine, rents for first-class commercial properties are also 50 percent higher than on the Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure, as well as less crime.
In a ranking by Mercer, the city is ranked seventh, Luxembourg is ranked 19th, Dublin is ranked 33rd and Paris is ranked 37th.
Even if quality of life is a matter of preference: "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors," concludes the IW.
However, despite the Brexit vote, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, according to economic researchers.
According to figures from the Landesbank Helaba, around 144,000 people worked in the banking sector at the end of 2015, while in Frankfurt there were 62,500.
Gilead Receives Legal Costs from Hepatitis C Patent Dispute with Merck
A U.S. judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbursement of legal costs incurred by it from the hepatitis C lawsuit with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was relieved of a $200 million indemnity payment for the violation of two patents from Merck, which stood in connection with the blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead, after a U.S. judge made a pattern of misconduct on the part of Merck, including misconduct, misconduct and other misconduct.
On Thursday’s filing, U.S. Justice Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead was entitled to a settlement of the costs incurred while defending the case.
Merck is trying to equate Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed ownership of laboratory work based on Sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead’s medicines.
US-backed troops say they have regained full control of Manbij from Islamic State
US-backed troops have regained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last ISIS fighters in the city left, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Democratic Forces of Syria (DKS) are combing through the city after the exodus of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves inside the city.
They have freed more than 2,000 civilians held hostage by fighters, Sharfan Darwish told DKS-allied Manbij Military Council Reuters.
“The city is now under complete control, but we are currently carrying out clean-up work,” he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, which resulted in an income of $10.75 million for the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $5.3 million in speech fees; the former Secretary of State reported a $3 million income from Simon & Schuster for her book about her tenure at the State Department.
Clinton’s vice presidential candidate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife Anne Holton, published his tax returns for the past ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency," Clinton's campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In a stark contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and backers regarding his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
It is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although they are not required to do so by law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have cited a tax audit by the tax authorities as the reason for his refusal.
“They’re on the train,” Clinton campaigner Ian Sams wrote on Twitter, referring to the Democratic presidential candidate’s announcement.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump’s special adviser, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything before the tax audits are complete.
Trump’s critics, including 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, have already made it clear that his refusal raises questions about wealth, his donations to charities, his business interests, and various other ties, particularly with Russia.
Clinton has already plunged into the issue and posted a video on the internet on Friday in which high-ranking Republicans are urging Trump to release his tax return.
On Thursday, she also addressed the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and publish his tax returns," she told the crowd.
Politico has reported that Trump paid no or very little tax for two years during the 1990s, and a New York Times economic journalist quoted a number of tax attorneys and tax advisers on Friday as saying that could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after billionaire and investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that individuals earning more than $1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a campaign event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate is based here, called for Trump to exchange his tax returns at a meeting.
Buffett said he had also been subjected to a tax audit by the IRS and Trump had “fear” of voters and not the tax authorities.
Clinton’s campaign has published a tax return dating back to 2007.
The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The Clintons’ tax return of 2015 showed that they received only $100 of their income as wages, unlike the majority of all Americans.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, from which the Clintons taxed dividends and income of $109,000.

Condoms with chili powder, fireworks promote Tanzania's elephant protection
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to stop elephants from going to human-inhabited settlements – they throw condoms at them that are filled with chili powder.
The method has proven to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which already had the idea years ago, has intensified its advocacy along with U.S. nature conservation by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-stage method to protect their homes and crops without injuring animals.
Previously, many spears have been used to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to animal welfare.
“Since we developed the ... Toolkit, we have been able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities, being much more confident that they can keep the elephants from their fields without harming the elephants,” said Damian Bell, CEO of Honeyguide.
The first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn.
If he is not deterred, a so-called "chili cloud" is thrown.
Chili powder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks body into a condom, the end of which is turned to the ignition cord.
When it is ignited, the condom bursts with a bang and sprays fine dust of chili powder into the air.
A touch is usually already out to chase the elephant.
A last possibility is a thrower, which shoots a gold rain firework into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
City Council unanimously decides: No new kiosk construction on the St. Goarer Rheinufer
Normally, the St. Goar investment projects are accepted by traders with kiss hands - but the retail trade in the core city is considered to be significantly expandable.
However, the City Council now unanimously rejected the request to build a new sales kiosk on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine balcony under construction.
"In principle, we welcome new business owners, but at this location on the banks of the Rhine in an exposed location, this kiosk does not fit," Michael Hubrath told the CDU Group.
Jewish director smashes Berlin hotel because Israeli phone number was removed after 'Arab' request - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media outcry after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli dialling code as it was “requested” by Arab guests, according to an employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah", left out his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel’s country selection list.
However, the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and erased?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinksi Bristol offers an option to select Israel via its own call center.
Looking for an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there “shocked him,” as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said the measure was a “deliberate decision of the management of the Kempinski hotels.”
The reason behind it caused even more anger in the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the prefix be deleted," the employee was quoted by Lanzmann as saying.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Trader, called this a "great shame", reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were shocked and dismayed by this event.
That's really very embarrassing.
The fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is an even greater shame.
There is no need for an explanation.
We expect the hotel to "get the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident triggered a rather large response on the Internet, in which people called the whole thing a scandal.
Some suggested to the Kempinski Hotel that it had "defuncted" the alleged invitations of Arab guests.
"Shame on you," it said in another post, pointing out that the hotel, located on the noble Kurfürstendamm, is near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly refuted all the accusations and called the incident a "mistake" and "excused" Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports.
"There was never a direct order to not include Israel in the electoral roll," a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel quoted the South German newspaper as saying.
It adds that the country code has now been added.
Police Use Tear Gas & Rubber Floors Against Protesting Brazilian Students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to demonstrate against government reforms for the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the demonstrators.
Difficulties began when police officers tried to dismantle the students, causing the police to use rubber floors and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their dismay at the plans.
According to the proposals of the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, just under 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students will be implemented to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen spraying graffiti against provisional president Michel Temer on walls.
The latest protests came days after protesters took to the streets to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been removed from office by a Senate vote to resign.
Trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
With the lifting of sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent year-on-year.
Since the lifting of the international sanctions against Iran, the interest on the part of Russian companies in business in the country has grown strongly, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are entering into existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to gain market access.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the top priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports into Iran increased by 91.5 percent spiking and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade boom was achieved through deliveries of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan is a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian foreign ministry issued around 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, Iran reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia.
One could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia from last year will be broken," he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have received monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Witness wanted: Beverage market raided in Waldbröl
A robbery was committed on Thursday evening at the Rewe XXL beverage market on the Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
Under the guise of a firearm, three dark-clad people who had disguised their faces demanded cash from the employee of the beverage market and then fled first on foot and then presumably with a silver-colored VW golf.
How much money was stolen, the police did not say.
The perpetrators are said to have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters tall, i.e. relatively small.
The beverage market is directly accessible from the Rewe market park deck and poorly visible.
After the assault, the perpetrators must have run towards Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and fled from the gravel parking lot opposite the parking lot entrance with the silver-coloured car, possibly towards B 256 (slider ring).
Anyone who has made observations at the time of the robbery (at 7:45 p.m.) in connection with the robbery should urgently report to the police.
Nagold: Game and fun during summer free time
The children and young people of the social education day group / social group work of the children's protection association Nagold spent eight beautiful and happy days with their caregivers on their summer holiday in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the leisure home Hardtwäldle, which was quietly located, the cheerful group was quartered during the first week of school holidays.
Several full-day excursions were on the program.
On the one hand, we went to Bretten with a visit to the zoo.
Secondly, to Maulbronn, where there was a special children’s tour in the world-famous monastery.
The third trip took us to Pforzheim.
At the Celtic Museum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the daily life and diet of the Celts.
On the hot days, the group enjoyed themselves at the deep lake in Maulbronn, which invited them to jump, swim and paddle.
Culinaryly, children and caregivers were pampered with their own prepared body dishes such as the Sauren Spätzle, the Seebronner Pfannle, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English breakfast and Tübingen Bolognese.
In workshops, beautiful pieces of jewellery made of pearls and stones were built, or a Roman mill game was made of wood.
Other highlights of the leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond, the evening at the fire and the final "Bunt Evening".
On the day of the trip home, the sun laughed and the children and teenagers returned home satisfied.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims to the Gate of Mercy
The ministers from the Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna Soul Care Unit were on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Together, four stages were completed.
In order to bridge the time until the next Rome pilgrimage of all ministers in probably two years, the High Ministers’ Round of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.
Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and finally the decision was made for the Bishops City of Freiburg, where this year a special pilgrimage destination was offered on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy with the Gate of Mercy at Freiburger Münster, which was opened for this purpose.
16 Ministries from Bitterbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and the Holy Rooms were on their way.
The evening before, Storost sent the pilgrims to St. Anna in a small celebration, blessed the pilgrim crosses and awarded the pilgrim victory.
From Horb, we took the train to the starting point of Villingen, where there is also a Münster Unserer Lieben Frau, and so the pilgrimage route was started from Münster.
The individual day tours were each framed by a short impulse with different prayers, songs and writings.
But also on the way, the minis at field crosses, chapels or churches repeatedly rested to sing together a song from a specially compiled pilgrim songbook.
For the nights, parish homes of the local parishes were available.
At the stage destinations, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty as well as strengthening dinner and breakfast.
On the second day we went over Furtwangen to Gütenbach.
The next day, the stage to St. Peter, which was the most strenuous route, had to descend about 500 meters in height and then climb again.
The reward earned was a joint barbecue at the Badweiher in the evening.
After the morning impulse on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, we went to the final stage to Freiburg.
Visibly relieved and happy, the minis arrived at Freiburger Münster the following afternoon and passed the gate of mercy.
With a little impulse, we thanked God.
At the evening fair in Münster, the minis arrived at the pilgrim destination were welcomed by co-operator Markus Obert.
After the service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.
The next day there was still time for the Breisgau metropolis.
In the afternoon we went back to Horb by train.
In the end, all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Scotland's Callum Skinner storms home as Brits win gold for cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner rose to fame last night in the men's team sprint at the Velodrome in Rio when the British team defended the London 2012 title.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took on the anchor role that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had taken for himself, and the young pundit made the legend proud when he stormed home to claim a victory from the New Zealand favourites.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy took the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after winning only a modest sixth place at the March World Railroad Championships in London despite Hoy's resignation.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of driver Jamie Staff.
They did this in time when Hindes appeared.
Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the Scotsman now unfolding.
Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes was just back after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner kept it.
A change of strategy made up a large part of the transformation, with Hindes driving in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep up the pace.
Hoy watched from his position as a BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they rose to the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: “It’s a flattering comparison.”
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final round and defeated the world champions.
It was just unbelievable.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 triumph alongside Kenny and Hoys, Hindes admitted that he deliberately fell on the track after a weak start.
He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection from England's rivals.
With such a great victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said, "It feels like London with all the GB flags on the stands."
We have been together as a team for the past three months.
We’ve gotten away so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which was won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of our progress over the last five months, then we expect successful five days in the velodrome.
With the form of Kenny, it is in the realm of possibility that he repeats Hoy’s victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
That would mean for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly sacred date for British sport; Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born that day) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That would be the same as Hoy's.
Kenny is the next to take part in the sprint, which starts today and will take place over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, “I just enjoy this for the moment.”
The team event is always the best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a bit lonely to win alone.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there was more good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race.
They arrived at the finish line at 3:51,942.
The world record, which won in 2012 in London Gold, was 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will surely be in focus.
He had been arguing with an officer before qualifying yesterday when officials called him in to measure his body size.
In the corresponding women’s competition, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in world record time in 4:13,260.
The GB team relies on its strong track cycling team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and pick up a bunch of medals.
After a truly extraordinary portrayal of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio have been lowered.
Dramas took place in the background, including the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid allegations of sexism and bullying, as well as the retirement of such greats as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first night of the competition in the velodrome, it looks like the now legendary reputation of GB, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated.
Future of Portland smelting questionable due to the cancellation of the energy contract
The future of Portland’s aluminium smelting in Victoria – as well as hundreds of workers’ jobs – is at stake as the plant operator cancels the energy supply contract and thus cancels all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company announced.
This step followed the government’s decision in Victoria earlier this year not to grant any further subsidies to operate the plant.
A 20-year grant expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs at the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.
No less than 2,000 jobs - both direct and indirect - could be at risk in the event of closure.
In addition, there could be domino effects, as the melting plant consumes about 10 percent of Victoria’s total power generation.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelting plant, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
The Alcoa smelting plant in Portland loses money and risks closure.
This step follows years of speculation regarding the future of the plant, initially as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the current price for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminium smelting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that it expects three more owners to terminate their contracts.
The plant is majority owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
“AGL expects the plant to continue operating in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity through the smelting plant,” the company said in a statement.
AGL further stated that the contracts were so-called "collateral transactions", which should have entered into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will end in 2017.
"Therefore, AGL expects that the contracts will contribute to revenues in the 17th fiscal year," said the electricity supplier.
All potential impacts on AGL revenues from GJ 18 onwards are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale current prices.
AGL announced that it had already written off the value of the contracts in its annual close of $187 million in "expectation of termination".
Alcoa said the decision to cancel the contracts did not affect Alcoas' "ability to operate the smelting plant or to ensure the power supply to the smelting plant."
The U.S. company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 that should have entered into force from November this year, even though it still owes a statement as to why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts warn due to the poor economic conditions of the industry against the possible closure of the Portland smelting plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
Speaking to analysts earlier this week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes around 600 megawatts of electricity a year and Tomago around 900 megawatts of electricity a year.
If both plants were to disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity market].
And for us as power generators, that would not be good," he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner clan, Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of US Vogue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder’s brand ambassador and ran for the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
“In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry,” Kendall wrote.
The unveiling of the cover was followed by a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of one of the world's most popular showbiz uncles and producers of Keeping Up Ryan's co-created the whole thing.
This represents the clichéd action of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the phrase, "You thought we'd forgotten you?"), with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on a broadcast spot at 8 a.m.), but Kris somehow had to let her other girls participate in this publicity.
With regard to the September edition of Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has surely begun.
Kendall's big sister Kim may have beaten her in terms of the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league in itself.
The September edition is the best-selling edition of the year for Vogue.
With a circumference that resembles a tape rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (according to Fashionista, of the 832 pages of the voter, 615 pages were advertising).
The revelation of his cover star is so eagerly anticipated that in the last two years, images of the magazine leaked before the official announcement.
Women who have previously been on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, and Kate Moss.
In recent years, clearly more "celebrities who model" than "models who are celebrities" were on the cover.
Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor.
But even with the slight chance that Ms. Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the earlier category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teens of today who know how to shoot a good Snapchat video (even if all of this applies to Jenner).
They are really talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone likes Jenner’s success.
With her reality TV story, Jenner’s position in the fashion world was always somewhat tense.
In June, former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid as "the shit of the moment."
These feelings boiled up again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.
But riding around on the misery seems to pass by the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She is, in the truest sense of the word, a supermodel.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
She advertises for your founding of Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.
She sells her pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, she's on reality TV, probably just to see her sister Kourtney and their kids.
Municipal Law Centers Reject 160,000 People Every Year
More than 160,000 of the country’s most in need of assistance are rejected annually by municipal law centers, while the industry is focused on the impact of further cuts on already overburdened transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly elderly people, immigrants, needy workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the means for unjust delogging and the like - are already being rejected when they apply for free legal advice and legal assistance.
Legal services of the municipality, which are already overloaded, are preparing for further cuts.
As of June next year, it is planned that these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
James Farrell, director of Queesland Municipal Law Centers, said the latest survey by the National Association of Municipal Law Centers found that thousands of people are already being rejected every year.
Farrell said the situation would only get worse without a repeal of the federal government’s decision.
"Queensland's community law centers are chronically underfunded, which means thousands of people are being turned down from important services you need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with uncontrollable and crushing debts, families who go through separations, workers who have been unfairly dismissed – all these people have legal problems and this survey shows that they can’t get the help they need.
As of June 2017, the federal government will cut funding by 30 percent, meaning thousands of more needy people from Queensland will be forced to deal with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Attorney General and the Federal Minister of Justice and Queensland Senators George Brandis to immediately lift these cuts so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the municipal law centers and their client communities, as well as that the Palaszczyk government is investing in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign indicted after employee allegedly pulled gun
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign has been indicted for alleged inaction after she was told that her campaign manager for North Carolina in February aimed a firearm at an employee while they were traveling in a jeep in February.
The incident is described in an indictment filed Wednesday in the state court of Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in that state.
Bordini claimed to have waited months for the matter to be settled internally before realizing that "it wouldn't happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "put a gun on, put his right index finger on the trigger, and framed the run in Vincent's kneecap," Bordini said in his indictment.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini noted that at least four other people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the indictment.
"Weapons do not need to be fired to cause damage," Bordini said.
The indictment comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate sparked a riot when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the “Second Amendment people” — gun owners and gun friends — should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton was to be elected and appoint a judge.
Trump’s campaign made it clear that the media had taken his words out of context and that he would not incite violence.
Bordini’s complaint demands compensation from the campaign for the violation of duty of care and from Philip for personal injury and lasting mental damage.
Trump's spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, was not available for a statement.
Attempts to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news station in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer an employee of the campaign.
Calls to his consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services, were not answered.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far run a controversial campaign.
The proceedings are Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Poll before country elections: SPD and CDU lose
The upcoming elections in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September) mark significant losses for the ruling parties SPD and CDU.
This was the result of representative surveys by the opinion research institute INSA for the "Bild" newspaper (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition in the north could barely rule further, this is not possible according to the poll results in Berlin.
In both federal states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to appoint the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to a poll, the party is still close to the CDU, which could return to 23 percent.
The third place is disputed between the left and the AfD.
The left would come to 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented with 19 percent for the first time in the state legislature.
The Greens, despite slight losses, re-entered the Schwerin parliament with 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent).
The NPD and FDP would not be represented in the state legislature with 3% each.
According to the poll, in the Berlin House of Representatives elections, the SPD would only come to 23 percent (election 2011: 28.3 percent).
The CDU only reached 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
They were still behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but ahead of the Left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented for the first time in the House of Representatives with 14 percent.
With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, while the pirates would miss the influx as opposed to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and the Internet in a hurry: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator came on the market.
The successors today dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it was not in good hands either.
On the contrary, it was pretty clunky.
The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would be enough for about two high-resolution selfies today.
An iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came into the stores exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996 - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet Age.
Twenty years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hanover as an "office in pocket format".
In fact, the new mobile phone was able to reach a lot for then standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax the communicator was reachable.
Even access to websites was possible via HTML browser, albeit painfully slow.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be folded up similar to a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.
The price was quite proud: 2700 D-mark, i.e. about 1400 euros.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany in 2015 was 392 euros.
No one could have guessed in August 1996 that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.
Everything has been different since then.
The smart phones are a success story, but not for Nokia.
The phone business of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, was eventually sold to Microsoft and handled.
Today, the market is dominated by providers who all came much later than Nokia.
Being online anytime, anywhere is everyday for a lot of people today.
In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
About 1.4 billion devices were sold, of which 555 million were sold to Samsung and Apple alone.
Worldwide sales of the devices amount to around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 billion.
In addition, the well-run businesses of countless app providers and telecommunications companies.
A whole industry has been created around the smartphone.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market came in early 2007, when Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone at the Mac-World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an internet communicator, all easy to use via touch screen.
Apple’s winning move began, and today, the iPhone is the company’s most important product.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, which dominated the market, had the foresight.
They finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung have the say.
20 years after its invention, the smartphone is a matter of course.
On average, every German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day.
"We all need to learn to put the smartphone away sometimes," said Janina Kugel, who is responsible for staffing at Siemens' board of directors.
Permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and a blessing at the same time.
England must steer the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only to our local municipalities and all over London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was Heathrow’s biggest attraction, just as it was back in 2012 in London, when we made a great effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And this will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities, we will create 10,000 new traineeships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
As they were before us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of the Heathrow expansion is too great.
I was told that England would never be ready for the games and that we would be blaming ourselves on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question he is asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many and not for individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, <0xC2><0xA3>211 billion in smart growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and throughout the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow that has implemented a <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from T5 – which was chosen as the world’s best airport terminal five years in a row, to T2, built amidst the world’s two most frequented runways.
Now they are ready to deliver a third runway, supported by <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion in private investment.
The London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time for us to steer this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow while securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "cat and mouse game" regarding ad blocking
For companies that make money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to circumvent ad blocking are tantamount to a "cat and mouse game".
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad blockers on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to block ads on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the coding of its ads to make it harder for ad blockers to recognize which part of the page is advertising.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that “this kind of back-and-forth battle between the ad-blocking open source community and the bystanders has been going on since the invention of ad-blockers,” and that it’s possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has entered the battle is a strong indication of how worrying ad blockers have become for the industry.
According to a study last year by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people worldwide use ad blockers; almost four times as much as in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook’s ad revenue.
The company has been targeting ad blockers on desktop PCs as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook’s mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a spokesperson said.
Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a large enough proportion of revenue, so Facebook seems to be worth the investment of such a step.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its “ad preference tool” to give people more control over targeted ads to them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock’s new filters would be worrisome because they would also block content on the page that is not advertising.
“For users, this is not a positive experience, so we plan to address the issue,” a Facebook spokesperson said in an emailed statement.
Ad blockers are a blunt means, which is why we’ve instead focused on developer tools like Ad Preferences to put more control in people’s hands.
Woman killed in suspected suicide on Swiss motorway
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are calling witnesses after a woman was killed in an alleged suicide by several vehicles on a highway in the early hours of Thursday.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Waadt shortly after midnight.
A woman lay in the dark "in an act of despair" on the street and were hit by several cars, police said in Waadt.
It is obvious that a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was overtaken by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been interrogated, but some have still not been identified, police said, urging them and any witnesses to report the incident.
An investigation procedure has been opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told the Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen if any of the drivers will be shown.
Was a collision avoidable?
This is something that the prosecutor has to decide," Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases over the past five years show that drivers are not held accountable.
In each of the two cases - in which a person was running in the dark on the highway - it was decided that the drivers did not have to assume that a pedestrian was running on the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.
Last year, a policewoman was acquitted of the negligent killing after driving over and killing a man who was lying on the A1 near Payerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and has gone unconscious on the street, the court heard.
The court found that the policewoman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- was driving in a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the street was a "completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
Venus was probably once habitable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere, could have once exhibited Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere, yet it was slowly spinning.
The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably had more arid areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and protect it from rapid evaporation.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposes its daily side of the sun for almost two months," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio said in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun’s heat.
The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of the Earth today.
The model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution previously suspected by planetary researchers.
Although it was once probably habitable, Venus -- over the course of several billion years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect remained -- the Venus we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy Resigns as Coach of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, leading an under-determination in the team's decision-making process.
Colorado’s alternate president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed this decision, noting that the club will immediately look for a new coach.
“Over the past three years, I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations at the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination,” Roy, 50, said in a statement.
I’ve been thinking for a long time and a lot over the summer about how I could improve this team to give it more depth, what it needs and take it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey operations must be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
He must also have a right to participate in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
“Patrick informed me about this decision today,” Sakic said.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future.
During his debut season at the 2013-14 Avalanches, Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award for Best Coach of the League.
He led the club to 112 points and to first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Minnesota playoffs and missed the postseason in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the wild for a second Wildcard spot in the Western Conference by five points.
As Hall of Fame goalkeeper, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea Oil Workers Resume Talks, Strike Off
Labour battles over North Sea oil workers’ pay are being suspended as all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks, negotiators said.
Strikes against oilfield service provider Wood Group were carried out sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
“Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute,” a joint statement said.
We will hold a few full-day meetings in the coming weeks, which will begin early next year, to address the problems anew.
The unions said their last strike, the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group has cut rates on its North Sea contractors by around 9 percent this year due to negative market pressure.
The company’s rate cut follows a 10-percent decline for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said additional cuts give the company the space it needs to get through the market downturn.
Shell has fired thousands of people on its behalf and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations as a result of its mega-merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, an economic situation that had been exacerbated by the decision of the British to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with workers’ leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes that has taken place in the North Sea for a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
“In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few,” he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected compared to an average of around $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of stars in the Pleiades cluster
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the Pleiades cluster.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars in the stellar cluster rotate at different rates and what the rotational periods are related to the formation of planets.
"We hope to learn more about the relationship between a star's mass, its age and even the history of its solar system by comparing our results with other star clusters," Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a press release.
The Pleiades star cluster is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many stars in this star cluster, which formed about 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.
They turn the fastest now.
At peak rotation rates, these ripening stars emit large amounts of stellar winds.
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
As a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by detecting the time between the appearance of a detectable star spot -- such as sunspots.
The latest catalogue of rotational rates indicates that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers, with larger stars spinning slower pirouettes than smaller ones.
"In the 'ballet' of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, while faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.
Since the star cluster of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotational rates.
"The Pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about, how, when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and hang up their "dance shoes" so to speak.
Rebull and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Pleiades, which will be published soon in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star resigns.
The tears ran faster with Alex Rodriguez than the US baseball star in the best days from base to base.
Following his emotional resignation announcement, the 41-year-old professional will wear his New York Yankees jersey one last time against the Tampa Bay Rays on August 12.
“I love this game and this team.
"I say 'goodbye' to both," said the 14-time all-star gamer of Major League Baseball (MLB).
Three times Rodriguez was chosen as the most valuable player in the league, in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.
His signing under a ten-year contract gave him $27 million a year since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will act as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary.
As a player, Rodriguez paid back with performance for a long time.
With 696 home runs, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994–2000), the Texas Rangers (2001–2004), and since 2005 the Yankees, he achieved some milestones.
With Hall of Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players have similar values in the main statistics.
However, the 41-year-old should not be admitted to the Baseball Hall of Fame.
Because how successful Rodriguez - nicknamed "A-Rod" - was on the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the square.
As early as 2009, the superstar admitted at "ESPN" to having taken banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was banned for 211 games due to involvement in the so-called biogenesis scandal until the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is considered the main suspect of having received performance-enhancing drugs for years through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a legal dispute, the ban was reduced to 162 matches.
“The league could have done me a favor for 2014, because I played 20 years without a break,” Rodriguez said at the time.
Even his farewell days don’t go by silently.
While many baseball legends in their last games once again get the big stage, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.
"My job doesn't involve a farewell tour."
“My job involves trying to win every game,” Yankees coach Joe Girardi said.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and is reminiscent of the relationship with pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, received sympathy statements from fans of the Yankee arch rival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod," the fans sang in the 4:9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekova and Adrian Zielinski are the first doping cases
Caught: Due to a positive doping test, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland in Rio is not allowed to start.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
A captured athlete would have almost won a medal.
Before the seventh day of competition, the first official doping cases have become known at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre obstacle courser Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were tested positive and excluded in Brazil - just before the start of the anyway critical athletics competitions, these news come to an end.
In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances, had already been detected last Sunday.
The International Sports Court CAS confirmed on Friday afternoon local time its exclusion from the Olympic Games.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had taken the fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly, only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen was expected to take part in the preliminary over 50 m freestyle.
Chen has asked the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to open the B-sample and hold a hearing.
The National Association takes the matter "very seriously and demands Chen's full cooperation in the investigations," Xinhua said in a statement: "We will cooperate with the CAS International Sports Court and will accept the verdict."
For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases.
Also on the night of Rio, the news about the positive test at Danekowa passed, the 33-year-old went on the offensive herself.
“I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive,” she told Bulgarian TV channel BNT.
She was innocent, "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," the athlete explained.
According to the report, the banned substance is the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekova was provisionally suspended, according to BNT, the B-sample has already failed positively.
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bojko Borissov immediately spoke out against the athlete.
"I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said, "we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
For example, all weightlifters from the chronically doping-laden nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case of "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympic winner in the class up to 85 kg was tested positive for the anabolic steroid Nandrolone like his brother Tomasz three days earlier.
Both contest the intake, but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of the athletes, especially the case of Danekova is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport.
The World Association IAAF had banned the entire Russian team from launching, except for one exception due to systematic doping, and the runners-up Kenya also produced numerous bad news in Rio.
In the swimming sport, the previous crimes in China had also caused violent clashes between the athletes.
The Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang.
"Sun Yang pinkish purple."
"When I see the podium over 200 m freestyle, I want to surrender," Lacourt told French radio.
Sun was also at the center of an argument with the Australian Mack Horton.
“I have no time and no respect for doping fraudsters,” he said.
Sun was tested positive for the stimulant trimetazidine at the 2014 Chinese Championships, but only had to sit a three-month lock.
Data theft: How perfidious hackers blackmail their ransom money
Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies – and are successful in doing so.
According to a recent survey of malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, the UK and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed were at least once in the past 12 months, sometimes multiple victims of an attack using blackmail software.
In Germany, nearly 20 percent of companies have already been targeted for ransomware suppression.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to reuse the attacked systems and data.
The perpetrators specialize their blackmailing software, according to the observations of malwarebytes, on attacks on corporate networks.
If they succeed there, the ransom money to be potentially blackmailed is significantly higher than that of private users.
“We are currently witnessing a frighteningly fast evolution of malware,” explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the “world.”
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertisements.
Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.
At first, private users were the target, but the switch to corporate attacks has been frighteningly fast in recent months.
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: Once active on a victim’s computer, it specifically searches for recently modified files such as Word, Excel, or database files as well as archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the ransomware and permanently delete the originals.
The software then presents the demands of the blackmailers.
In order to get the final encryption code to the files, the victims need to transfer money – usually in the form of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
But where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production stops.
Accordingly, the damage is higher when a ransomware strikes.
22 percent of affected German companies reported revenue losses from ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely interrupt business activities, in one case people were in danger of life.
In Germany, hospitals have already been victims of attacks several times, whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.
“We always say to the victims: Don’t pay, you’re only promoting the problem,” Kleczynski explains.
But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay get their data back.
It is difficult for managers to reject the demands of the perpetrators in the face of downtime.
The hackers, in turn, know this and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, F-Secure’s security researchers looked at user interfaces and contact with blackmailers and came to the conclusion that the perpetrators are actually trying to build some kind of customer service to make more money.
They explain to their victims via chat how to pay via Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support sites, or decrypt sample files for free.
And if individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies will have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums in order to get their data back unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively risk-free profits from ransomware suppression, hackers are becoming more professional and sharing the work, says security expert Chester Wisniewski of antivirus provider Sophos: “An individual can write a ransomware about within a week.”
However, it is more likely that they are three or four people.
The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software builder to the actual blackmailers.
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price between $1,000 and $10,000.
“A customization tool is included so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed,” says Wisniewski.
The blackmailers are then looking for other hackers to distribute the newly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service industry.
So you log into one of the underground forums, buy the set from a criminal and commission another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is made per infected computer.
"Usually, the criminals then commission spammers with the spread," Wisniewski explains.
The risk of ransomware is now known to many companies that are better at securing their data.
More than 50 percent of enterprise IT executives in the Malwarebytes survey trust to be able to fend off ransomware using file backups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
“If data encryption alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful digging, the perpetrators instead threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations,” explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski.
Depending on the type of data, the potential for damage is thus many times higher than before.
In the future, the perpetrators could also take on completely new goals in the Internet of Things.
At the hacker conference Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of winter, unlocking such a blocked heating could be worth a ransom for many victims.
If the perpetrators then instead of heating in the future block an entire production line in a factory, ransomware could also become an issue in Industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
In the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupe and also the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds pretty overloaded, but the HR-V, which was built on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V seems rather small, the passengers have a lot of space both in the front row and in the back, it does not seem tight anywhere.
The materials of the interior are well processed and look pleasant, only the top of the cockpit falls off slightly.
More versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR-V in the storage compartment.
Not only is a 453 litre trunk available for raised and 1026 litre for folded backrests, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: the seating areas of the backseat can be folded up like a cinema chair and thus offer storage space that is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.
The trunk can be loaded well, but the loading height is slightly higher with 650 mm than with the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6 l diesel with 88 kW/120 hp accelerates the HR-V with a torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges very powerfully.
However, he should do his job a little quieter.
The daily consumption is 4.7 l/100 km.
There is another motorization: a 1.5-liter petrol engine with 96 kW/130 hp.
A four-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
The steering should be a bit more direct.
The equipment does not leave open any wishes in the tested top version "Executive".
The safety systems include the City Emergency Brake Assist (works up to Tempo 32), the Collision Warning System and the Track Keeping Assist.
The collision warning sometimes annoys because it evaluates many obstacles as "approaching objects" when ranking.
The high-beam assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent cruise control responds to traffic sign recognition and throttles the speed if needed.
However, the full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI socket are located under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to reach.
The around 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.
Those who do not want to invest so much will receive the petrol engine from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro 6 exhaust standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline is not liable: crash on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the crash of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
Because liability is only conceivable in the event of dangers typical of air transport, argued the Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf (Az.: 18 U 124/14).
The plaintiff had broken a kneecap during the crash.
However, the accident could have happened anywhere - it was a general risk of life, the court said.
The airline did not have to pay any damages to the man.
Case of illness: When does the organizer pay
Sick holidaymakers will only get a refund after their trip if the cause of the disease is unquestionably found in the hotel.
However, this is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests have been shown to have the same symptoms.
In the negotiated case, a family was seriously ill with diarrhea and vomiting on the second day of their Turkey holiday.
She spent almost the entire holiday in the room.
Their illness led the vacationers to a defective sewage treatment plant that allegedly polluted the seawater.
The family was of the opinion that the trip was flawed - and complained against the organizer.
In court, the plaintiffs had no success.
In fact, the sewage system was defective.
However, the organizer only learned about it shortly before the plaintiffs left.
He had to assume by then that the sea water was fine.
So he did not violate his information obligations, according to the verdict.
Especially since no impurities were found in the water samples.
The illness of several hotel guests - possibly by infection with each other - is a general risk of life.
Of the 691 guests, only 38 were ill.
De Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re said after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were worried about further attacks.
At the same time, the state must react wisely and resolutely to terrorist threats.
Our country will not respond to the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not give this victory to the terrorists.
However, if criminals had to leave the country faster, this would increase security and also strengthen the population’s approval of the refugee policy.
De Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re wants to achieve implementation of the proposals by the 2017 Bundestag elections.
He also announced a further personnel reinforcement of the security forces, namely "in the medium four-digit order of magnitude over several years".
Sympathy advertising for terrorism must be punished again.
Video surveillance is to be improved, the gun law is to be updated in such a way that it is especially difficult to buy weapons on the Internet.
According to de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re, the last much-discussed duty of silence for doctors is to be maintained.
However, he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the medical department to reduce the risk to citizens, he said with a view to mental disorders.
In order to counteract the radicalisation of refugees, the Minister believes that better social care is necessary.
Teachers should be better prepared to deal with traumatized people.
In order to track down criminals in special areas of the Internet (darknet), de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re plans to use covert investigators.
SPD chief Gabriel said, “The SPD is ready to talk about anything that helps to further increase security.”
It is important that the Minister of the Interior has clearly spoken out against actionism.
"This was a blow to the sharpeners in the CDU/CSU," Gabriel told the newspapers of the Funke media group (Friday).
De Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re had previously rejected calls from the Union for a Burka ban and the abolition of dual citizenship.
He considers a general ban on full veiling to be constitutionally problematic.
You can't forbid everything you refuse, and I refuse to wear the burka.
You can talk about rules, for example, in road traffic or for witnesses in court.
Green chief Simone Peter accused the minister of wanting to simulate action and ability to act with ever new anti-terror packages.
Left Party leader Bernd Riexinger said: "Floating sayings and a tightening of the right of residence do not bring people in this country any more security."
Improved traffic flow on the motorway
It regularly stands on the bypass road - here is a picture of November.
But that is to change: the right turn track is to be extended.
This is good news for all car drivers who are stuck in traffic on the surrounding road every night when they drive over the motorway (A 43).
On Tuesday and Wednesday (16/17 August) in the area between Hammer Straße and the exit of Weseler Straße, the road construction company will extend the right turn track by 700 metres.
Drivers can then thread directly from the Hammer road to the right.
The big advantage: The traffic divides more early, which improves the overall flow on the busy section of Bundesstraße 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU-Fraktion representation in the district of Münster-West.
The constriction of the road on the feeder annoys the drivers especially between 5 pm and 7 pm.
On weekdays, the backshaft extends to the bridge over the Albersloher road and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the needle point on the B 51 just before the departure of Weseler Straße.
From here, the traffic is only steered one lane over the highway bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilt well over a quarter of a year ago.
The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load-bearing capacity to accommodate heavy-duty traffic on two tracks.
How long this bottleneck and the associated workday congestion will last cannot be determined by the competent national operator.
However, we can count on years: because the bridge has an official rest period until the year 2034.
For the extension of the legal deflection track, the state company has deliberately chosen the weaker time in the school holidays, because it is expected to have disabilities.
Traffic will pass the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday on a single track.
Intercultural Journey: Cultural Offerings for Schools
The international class of the forest school visited the play "The Invisible House".
The club Nima's and the Junge Theater are now planning a music project.
The Nima's association allows young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has visited a performance of the award-winning piece "The Invisible House" of the Young Theater Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Journey" initiated by Nima's association, 19 students between the ages of 11 and 15 visited the staging in the Small House.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set itself the goal of cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background, offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.
Most of the young people in the class came from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 and speak little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenic images and video animations, it was possible for them to follow the course of the action anyway, according to the press release of the Junges Theater Münster.
The Nima's association, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the Junge Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without a refugee and migration background between the ages of 14 and 20 will have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the areas of singing, dance, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the area of theatrical play and theatrical language teaching are in the planning.
The project "Intercultural Travel" continues.
In view of the increased numbers of refugees, the association expects many classes to participate.
Rain instead of stargazing: Hope for weather improvement
The weather has taken a toll on the star-gazing guckers in southwestern Germany on the night of Friday - but there is still hope.
The night was badly suited to watching the sky spectacle because of clouds and rain, the chairman of the Welzheim Observatory, Hans-Ulrich Keller, said on Friday morning.
Our hope is in the night until Saturday.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we will definitely see a lot of stargazing in the sky.
The constellations are Perseids, which are among the fastest at 216,000 kilometers per hour.
They are named because they appear to come from the constellation Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
Restful Night: Tips against Sleep Disorders
In the evening you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning you can no longer think of sleep long before the alarm sounds.
This is anything but restful.
After all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent often or permanently feel their sleep is not restful.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest themselves?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and they can be caused by a variety of causes, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, board member of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
However, what is commonly understood is insomnia, i.e. a sleep disturbance.
It is precisely the sleep apnea that many people feel is unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, a member of the board of directors of the German Association of House Doctors with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel.
What Is Behind Sleep Disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
Organic, psychological or behavioral factors, as well as medications, can be involved.
It is not uncommon for sleep disorder to be an expression of another disease.
"Very early waking up is common, especially with depression," says Weeß.
And it may be that different factors condition each other.
For example, if you have a herniated disc accident, it can be bad, you wake up every two to three hours and you may start to fret about everyday problems and worries, Weeß gives an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should you go to the doctor with sleep disorders?
Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are impaired during the day should go to the doctor, Weeß advises.
The impairment can look completely different: one is beaten, tired, insomnia, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical discomfort such as stomach or headaches.
To alleviate the sleep disorder, it is important to find out their causes.
Treatment options include behavioral changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or even medications - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and for a maximum of two weeks.
There are hardly any established sleep physicians in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical center of Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.
Therefore, in case of sleep problems, you should first contact the GP, advises Weeß.
He can clarify with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleep lab, and what happens there?
For examination in the sleep laboratory, doctors advise, for example, in snoring with breath excretors, in sick daytime fatigue, in sleepwalkers or if the cause of sleep disturbance is not found, Fietze explains.
You don’t really have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normally.
"Just please don't take a lunch break," says Fietze.
After wiring, you go to bed at your normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, one wears a noseglass, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeping person.
How can those affected get to grips with the problems?
There are quite a lot of adjusting screws that you can put on for a better sleep.
Weeß counts on: regular hours of sleep and getting up, not lying in bed for too long, not sleeping during the day, not watching TV to fall asleep, avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then you start to count immediately, and that is not at all conducive.
What the Jungle Camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler has spoken via Facebook about the disappointing shutdown of the DSV team at Olympias.
In December 2014, he won gold at the short-track world championships in Doha for the first time, setting his first world record.
Former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has now taken a protective stand against his criticized former teammates via Facebook.
"In a country where an Olympic winner gets a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20,000 prize and a jungle king <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150,000, no one should be surprised about missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night.
The support system in swimming is poor, but the doping controls are very good.
This does not allow us to compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look so closely at the issue of doping or even operate it.
"I'm not saying that the controls should be stopped here," he said.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be notified nine months before his first start of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
This is exactly what should be done with countries.
"Anyone who cannot be controlled by independent WADA/FINA controllers for some time before the World Cup/OS is not allowed to participate," the Wahl-Hamburger, who now operates an ice rink, says.
Airport: Gang of Baggage Thieves Arrested
Professional Thieves at Düsseldorf Airport
On Thursday, the Düsseldorf police managed to arrest two women and two men between the ages of 50 and 61.
The suspects had committed several thefts of bags and luggage as a gang.
Around 9:30 p.m., civil officials in the Düsseldorf airport area again recognized a gang known to police officers from past robbery crimes.
The two women and two men had committed several crimes since mid-July this year and had done so jointly, part-time and especially professionally.
The specialists of the Criminal Commissariat 34 can prove four acts to the thieves who had arrived in Germany specifically to commit crimes.
They had looted a total of over 15,000 euros.
Old buildings, a few linden trees, in the meantime a rest of the headstones: The Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like this at first glance, but the police are among the "dangerous places" of the city.
If you walk along the road from east to west, you will pass playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and an organic shop.
Someone sprayed on the facade of a gray house "ugly!"
Opposite a Lidl, which is also to be demolished soon, is already being built: By 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments is to be built here.
However, in recent weeks, articles about this "trend district", as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls it, have been preferentially depicted with burning cars.
The reason is the house with the number 94: Once it was occupied, now the residents have leases, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.
Since the beginning of the year, Berlin’s interior senator, Henkel, in particular, had repeatedly advocated a tough police action against the project, calling the area a “no-go zone” for police officers and the 94 a starting point for autonomous violence.
After the ground floor rooms, the Kadterschmiede, had been cleared with 300 police officers on June 22, the police patrolled for three weeks, according to official statements, with 30 to 40 officers and three crew cars on site, blocked parts of the street and prevented visitors from entering the house with the number 94.
Meanwhile, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the evacuation had been illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers withdrew with the cheer of sympathizers and residents.
On this summer afternoon, the street looks peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk before late.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in Kiez since 1999, and Jana*, who raises three children here, are especially annoyed by the police presence.
With the residents of the house projects, they share the concern about rising rents and gentrification.
It does not sound like a Kiez who wanted police protection from the vandalizing left.
The trench that the Berlin senator and the police open between housekeepers and their neighbors does not seem to exist.
Friedrichshain in East Berlin was actually a traditional working-class neighbourhood, which still has a low average income and a high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
House occupations and the housing projects born from them have long been part of the Kiez: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Straße very close to the Riga River.
While the Mainzers were cleared in a real street battle under a large police station, many of the projects in Riga were legalized and are still inhabited today by the people who occupied them 26 years ago.
At the same time, in recent years, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and election Berliners from all over the world: with them now residents from GDR times and former house occupiers share their kiez.
This is also evident in the rents, which have increased by almost 60 percent in new rentals since 2009.
Many of the new buildings in Riga are attacked as symbols of this development: you can recognize them on thrown-in disks or freshly painted facades that were thrown with paint bags.
No other road has been mentioned so often this year, along with the words “autonomous violence on the left.”
One reason why not all neighbors see this as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: Crimes such as personal injury are, according to statistics, almost exclusively directed against police officers.
Most of the crimes are property damages, which tend to be more likely to hit the new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a rental house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no question of uncertainty.
As far as violence is concerned, she is reassuring: the people in the 94 are her neighbors, who certainly were not.
Even the famous burning cars no longer exist directly in Riga.
For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than anywhere else".
New builder has deliberately moved into Rigaer Straße - and stayed.
That’s why it was so important to her that the locals got their street back: from the police, the politics and the media, who all of a sudden claimed sovereignty over the district in July.
But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away from them: through faceless new buildings in former construction gaps that displace the old residents.
“After all, these are condominiums that aren’t interesting to many here – people who aren’t so well-obsessed are more likely to live here,” she says.
"Violence and destruction I can't approve of at all."
But what to do if no one ever listens to you?
There is frustration on all sides, including with the police and the residents.
Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding of those attracted who are angry about color bombs: The house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.
Anyone who pulls out should be aware of this - just as someone who moves to a pub district can complain badly about noise there.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new refugee commissioner
Annika Deuschle is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer.
She is also a local social worker.
Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach.
The social educator supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a contact person for all actors: refugees, refugee aid, administration, authorities and anyone else involved.
Regine Kunde from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now here, the egg-laying woolen milkshake, which has above all a problem.
For example, some, less derogatory than rather aimed at the multitude of desired areas of responsibility, had meant when the administration wanted to tender the position.
We were looking for an administrative expert with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, namely an egg-laying wool milkshake.
However, administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.
Above all, it is about organization, working with people on site and behind the scenes as well as networking.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
She has limited a 50 percent position to three years.
“It was high time,” says Regine Kunde, that Annika Deuschle supports honorary and principal actors.
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.
New containers will soon be in the Wasenstraße
It has been a serious problem for some time to find housing for the refugees who have been recognized.
The municipalities are responsible for the connection accommodation.
They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living quarters.
The cost of building, renting or renovating these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility shifts from the county council office to the municipality and job center.
Problem: There are free properties, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
De facto, the administration does not find any private housing.
It does not work so far, depending on private housing, according to Deuschle.
Therefore, communal apartments must be cultivated, as it is so beautifully called.
So new containers will soon be installed in the Wasenstraße.
But it is not done only with apartments.
Perspective is the keyword, Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a permanent residency, there are internships, training places, school places, one-euro jobs and relief activities for refugees and migrants that need to be found or set up.
"More places would be good," reports Regine Kunde.
Many work in the construction yard or help housekeepers, do non-profit work - and that's motivated and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.
She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect.
This is not “employment therapy.”
But activity is not just about work.
The day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer.
People need to develop a sense of belonging.
So you need offers such as sports, contacts with locals and, above all, language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So, administration and volunteers also jump in here.
It is crucial that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the proceedings is a problem.
You have to explain to the refugees that it just takes time and they can bridge the time meaningfully, for example with language courses.
Anyone who at some point develops the feeling that he cannot help anyone in Urbach, is not allowed to work and is useless, he will never integrate.
The vast majority are motivated.
But there are also cases of problems, says customer honestly, "people who do not do anything at all". The work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always also to motivate others.
All of this is a “mother task.”
A difficult question: Are the two, according to recent events, afraid of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," says Regine Kunde very clearly, "what some might call naive." A residual risk can and does not want to exclude them.
But the helpers are already sensitized.
These incidents are also an issue for refugees.
They were afraid that the assassins would completely discredit them.
“They want to show that they have nothing to do with it,” says Regine Kunde.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
So, principal and volunteers must keep an eye on activities on the ground and in the region.
They always have in the background that a new blow to refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Does Germany need an upper limit?
To answer this question clearly, politics are shy.
Actually, it's unfair to put them on the spot.
"In Urbach we have not yet reached where we wanted to go," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine Kunde also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already exhausted in integrating the previous people rationally.
These are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.
But if people are in need, you have to help them, both women agree.
The political situation in the world is so complicated that there are no simple answers.
Schorndorf: Search for a burglar with a helicopter
The police helicopter flew off different areas for about an hour – unsuccessfully.
Two unknown men forcibly broke into an apartment in a multi-family house on Lindenweg at 8:50 a.m. on Friday morning.
The inhabitant surprised the two and beat the monsters into flight.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 meters tall, well masked, both wearing blue jeans and black hoodies.
They fled to downtown.
The police deployed several strip crews as well as a police helicopter to find them.
The search was unsuccessful.
Eventually, the unknowns appeared before the fact near the apartment or during their escape.
