What is going to happen? CSSD knows neither Voldemort nor bakery in Prague.
The new CSSD elected to the capital's mayoral office will apparently have to overcome a real language barrier to understand each other at the city council level with their former and new ODS colleagues.
The daily Actualne.cz has "tested" the new members of the city council belonging to CSSD, namely whether they know the argot who was born in recent years in the city hall, when it was the partners of the current coalition that were leading in Prague.
The coded vocabulary that the Prague political cream set in motion during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It is with surprise that it has been discovered that the new elected representatives do not understand the known terms very well.
At least they say so.
"Who is Valdemort?"
“I really don’t know.”
"I am a young man in Prague politics," said Lukas Kaucky, who was elected to the culture to test the vocabulary of the "godfather".
And as for the political veteran, the elected Karel Brezina reacted in the same way.
For example, the meaning of "golf hole".
“It’s the only expression you offer me that I use.”
Otherwise, I don't use the arrogance.
From the vocabulary, of which the newspaper Aktualne.cz published the expressions in June of this year before the pre-electoral congress of the ODS, the editorial staff chose 6 examples, primarily those related to the Prague City Hall.
The Socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the largest golf hole in Prague", go to the patisserie", "beef nerve", "treason of the capital" and "ent<0xC3><0xB3>ler".
Three of the electors agreed to the quiz, the fourth - Antonin Weinert, who is to lead education in Prague in the future - promised first an interview but then did not pick up the phone.
The fifth-elected Petr Dolinek has sincerely refused the test.
“I don’t deal with these things at all and how the representatives of citizen democracy are having fun: I won’t give my opinion.”
"I'm currently dealing with how we're going to understand each other within our programs," he said.
As we have already heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky would apparently not recognize in the above legend, that it is the influential Janousek on the entrepreneurs and friends of the former mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" doesn't say anything to Kucky and the only phrase he guessed in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
“This is the Blanka tunnel,” Kaucky says, adding immediately: “But I know it from the newspapers.”
"I'm going to have to pay for a language course," he jokes.
Not only matador Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, the chosen for the environment, know that the golf hole is the Blanko tunnel.
The two Social Democrats know who Voldemort really is and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks of the meaning of "going to the pastry shop".
"This is, I think, going to a company," Plachy is ready to guess that this is the headquarters of Janousek's companies.
In the same tone, Brezina recalls that he draws his knowledge rather from newspapers and not from any vocabulary he would use.
According to the candidates for the tests, there is no lexicon of arg<0xC3><0xB3>t in social democracy.
“I have consulted with colleagues and it appears that we really don’t have something like this.”
“Names are sometimes used with abbreviations and symbols,” says Peter Hlinsky, president of the Social Democratic Party, who the members of the Party call Hulda.
“I was called Briza at school but I don’t know if my colleagues call me that,” says Karel Brezina about nicknames.
The newspaper Actuel.cz has tested the name and it works.
The elected Weinert is Papy for the party members or least friendly Little Old Man, the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the elections by scams during party sponsorship, is nicknamed "the little toy".
The nicknames are also the only ones that the Social Democrats admit to use within the party.
It seems that Hulinsky does not like to hear Hulda very much, but the daily Akutel.cz has recorded another nickname for this Prague president.
"Doctor in the law of sledgehammer" it seems that Petr Hulinsky obtained his title of doctor in law at the police academy of bratislava.
The government wants to reduce the torture of "witches," a pamphlet has been published.
In Burkina Faso, women declared witches have common traits.
They are part of the older generation, cannot work for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The one who becomes a "witch" is isolated so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
"Man has very seldom this destiny."
"We also don't judge healthy young women because they participate in work and give birth to children," says a sister who takes care of the West African country's capital, Burkina Faso, in a special facility of more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government has decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure".
He published a pamphlet that should help limit witch hunts.
The case involves a "hic".
“More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso don’t know how to read,” Die Standard warned of the drawbacks of written education.
Accusations of witchcraft are common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighbouring Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and a man then burned with oil that they had sprinkled on her.
It was the BBC server that transmitted this information.
Criminals say it was the wrong eye.
According to their version, the oil used for ritual ointments became inflamed upon contact with the woman.
The oil flared, it seems, when the team wanted to "throw out the bad spirit" of the woman.
Isolation of "witches" is approved by people of all levels of education.
The daily Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: “Eaters of human minds have always represented a danger,” he says.
While Burkina Faso is striving to reduce witch-hunting, the Gambia saw the President himself participate in it no later than last year.
Gambian President Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, launched a wide-ranging witch hunt which, it seems, would have participated in his death and would have been striving by the black magic to kill the President as well.
"Close Guinean shamans who came to the rescue have brought to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of police officers and the personal guard of the President, randomly selected men and women in villages in the Gambia," Amnesty International said in a statement.
On the farm, prisoners were required to drink a herbal potion with hallucinogenic effects that, in addition, had other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two of the prisoners did not survive.
On international pressure, about a thousand people were released.
The tenant of Bakal: The stoves are heating, he has signed a higher rent.
An imposing old man came out the door of the customer center of the RPG company Byty of the "coal baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
He had a file under his arm with three new leases for three apartments: his own, his daughter’s and his son’s, who is about to serve a sentence.
Deregulation has led to an increase in rent for these three people.
Instead of paying 3500 the son will have to pay from next year for a 2+1 apartment of the second category 4100 crowns.
“And there’s no hot water and the heating works on solid fuel,” points to her son’s new contract with the man who has the power to sign.
"But I signed anyway," he explains in anger and half resigned.
The citizen association of apartments BytyOKD.cz, which described the new rental conditions as "immoral and indecent", advises tenants not to sign and wait until December 7, when a notice will be published to explain the method to be followed to claim.
But the man reacts to this with a gesture of his hand.
"One says that, the other says something else," frowning.
The Ostrava region becomes the laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, this is what awaits most apartments in the Czech Republic whose rents do not correspond to the market price.
Aktualne.cz has therefore decided to personally visit the "laboratory".
The RPG waiting room in Havirovska Street is one of the four in the Ostrava region and is already full on Tuesday at 9 a.m.
Just next to the door stands a guard of a security company with a device to call customers.
A special button, "rent 2011", is lit on the touch screen.
A single press and a paper with a number comes out of the device.
You do not have time to read your number "157" as your number already begins to light up on the big screen under the top of the waiting room.
In a fraction of a second, it's your turn.
After a short moment, an old couple arrives to inquire about the rent, but the new rents do not seem to concern the people in the waiting room.
The majority of people have come to solve common problems as everywhere - requests for repairs, insurance events and others.
In the Ostrava region, people from more than 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio have been receiving mail with the new leases in their mailbox since about mid-November.
RPG Byty offers them rent increases of 15 to 38 percent.
The special window for new rentals has been open to the public since November 18.
"it's been working for almost a week, so it's still on trial," replies the employee behind the counter after a moment of hesitation when the client presents himself as a journalist.
Deragulation and the former Bakal miners' apartments are a very sensitive local topic.
The Vice-President of the Parliament and from the region of Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek of the Social Democrats reported this in a rather supportive way before the elections and it now fills the local newspapers.
“Twenty years later, I want a new floor.”
"They didn't even change a board put...n in the toilets, relieved in the introduction the man mentioned.
However, it is mostly, according to employees, retirees who come to be sure that they will receive a discount on the new rent price if they sign now as promised by RPG in a special offer.
This is a reduction of half of the rent that will be received by the other tenants who will have signed their new contract before December 15.
But the "deregulation" window of Havirovaska Street is really not overwhelmed by the issues.
"Of the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came for the rent," the employee said at the counter.
And yet RPG porpose both on its website and in the showcases of individual interviews on rents when necessary.
If the two parties do not agree on the rent, the decision will be taken by an independent court.
“It’s not about threats, it’s just about informing about the unique and legitimate way to act legally,” says RPG on its website.
"No one's going to court here," one of Byty's RPG employees thinks, and the man in the street in front of the customer center gives her reason.
“I have 13,000 crowns of retirement and I have 5,000 crowns left to eat, I don’t have enough to go to court,” he says.
The employee suddenly feels uneasy.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media asks that no one sign and so people are waiting," she said.
Rent regulation ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"And, in addition, the current rents still do not reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the fund for housing," recalls Pavel Klimes, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, that it is the neglect of the fund for housing that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the increase in rent.
However, in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest with rents in apartments 4 billion, in four years from 2011 to 2014 it is expected to make 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging from the ceiling in front of the upholstered armchairs of the waiting room on Havirosvka Street, however, repeats some information indicated in red.
The increase in rent in 2011 is 15 percent and concerns no less than 31,200 apartments, or more than 90 percent of RPG apartments.
"And it will always be a maximum of 7.50 Czech crowns per m2 per month," says the screen.
The 38 percent increase concerns only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
"In these cases, this is an increase of a really very low amount of 19.66 Czech crowns per m2," adds RPG.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical but gradual increase over 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money from the rent increase (see graph) is returned to the apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the agreement on the rent increase have priority.
The kindergarten is part of, too, offices have understood the architects.
the administrative building Avriopoint Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch. Design.
No one could have expected that it also houses a mini kindergarten with everything you need - colored walls, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October last year, the children of the employees of Arch. design can visit it.
The architectural project company Arch. Design. whose workshops produced a large number of constructions in Brno, has imagined its corporate mini kindergarten since the first drafts of the Avriopoint building.
It employs about 90 people, mostly from childbearing age, and it was important to her that women architects and project managers could quickly return to work.
At the same time as reduced-time employment contracts, kindergarten is a bonus offered to its employees by Arch. Design. as part of its social program.
Builders and architects thus have the opportunity to combine work taking care of children.
It was the employees of Arch.Design.themselves who conceived this kindergarten and with the support of the management they were able to obtain a grant from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini-kindergarten is funded by the European Social Fund through the Human Resources Operational Programme and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
They were able to purchase equipment and appliances and after two years ensure a qualified staff as well as the start-up, thanks to the funding allocations (to the amount of 2.8 million Czech crowns).
After the use of the funding endowment (two years) the company Arch. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to run the mini kindergarten on its own funds.
The preparation of the project lasted a year and it was the company Economy rating that helped to make the application for staffing.
Childcare is provided by qualified staff, all day a nurse and kindergarten teacher take care of the children. children can go to kindergarten without age limit but they have more than three ansformost.
As this is a "mini kindergarten" there can be only 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more that are replaced.
The operation of the school is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use this school regardless of the hierarchical position.
Although this is individual care and education, the mini-kindergarten program is comparable to that for preschool education.
The children not only play there, but quality teaching is also ensured - from the beginning to the preparation for the school benches we teach English.
The class is equipped not only with imaginative toys and games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of young children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can control their child at any time and not have the stress of a delay in going to pick up the children at a school away from the parents' workplace.
Parents use their time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that a natural relationship of loyalty is created between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design.s is among the companies that offer a bonus of choice for the recruitment of new employees and who are friendly to the family and through this program strengthens the marketing of HR.
The house in bone still fascinates after 100 years. Take a look at the interiors of Gaudi.
The roof resembles the back of a prehistoric saurian, the staircase to a dinosaur spine and the balconies to open fish mouths.
This is how the Casa Battlo house in Barcelona of the architect Antoni Gaudi is.
Due to its organic forms, the house received the nickname of Bone House from the locals.
Organic forms, wild colors, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and mosaic, facade reminiscent of scales and everywhere present curves, this is all that is typical of Art Nouveau by Antoni Gaudi.
The front facade of the house unfolds its dream lines, its colors and pleasant textures that remind nature and animals.
In the course of a more detailed observation, we see geometry, rhythm and precisely thought-out order.
At night the facade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such a way that the impression of brightness of the colors is reinforced by it.
The winding and twisting of the shapes also appears in the interiors with the same measurement.
The wood copied in waves the window frames, railings, decorative elements of the doors, the eyelet and the slats.
The house Battlo which stands in the Eixample district in the shopping street Passeig de Gracia at number 43, was born from the construction of a house from 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
Reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a wealthy entrepreneur, first insisted on demolishing the old building and building another brand new one but quickly accepted Gaudi's idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a multi-family house was not conceived by Gaudi alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It was on his project that the decorations for an apartment of representation of the owner of the building and the use of the mosaic for the facade were born.
For the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade also worked other artists and creators.
The joint work for the plans of Casa Battlo began with a successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudi's Casa Mila house and Guell Park in which there are other works by Gaudi.
The locals nicknamed the hot house just after it was finished because of its organic shapes "the House in Bone".
Others, given the specific mechanism of opening the windows, called it "the house that rents".
It is said that at the top of the construction there is a sword similar to that of Saint George the patron of Catalonia.
Other elements of the construction sculpture contain hidden religious motifs.
Gaudi thought for the house a unique system in its central heating time, with ventilation vents and typical fireplaces.
Their inclination of 45 degrees seems strange.
During the creation, Gaudi absolutely did not follow the construction guidelines of the time and did not allow himself to be hindered by them.
At the beginning of the construction he obtained from the city the building permit, knowing, of course, that the data carried on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years later during the completion the city council was horrified and asked for changes.
The members of the city council, for example, did not like the pillars of construction being pushed onto the public sidewalk.
There was never any change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call of the city Josep Battlo asked (and got satisfaction) permission to rent the two highest floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and on the third a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewellery store.
The entire six-storey house is shared by a staircase through which one accesses to an independent roof terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were annulled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and replaced by curved walls.
Gaudi also worked on the modern concept of connecting spaces.
The communal part can be fully connected by opening the doors of the salons and the high society can communicate comfortably or limit the private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with the reconstruction of Gaudi received a non-traditional roof and two additional floors.
Gaudi’s play with light is also impressive, with blue and white glass tiles with which the inner courtyard is decorated and with the wells of light.
The two-color game gives maximum light in all floors of the house.
It was enough just to bet on the principle that white reflects more than dark, which on the contrary absorbs the rays of the sun.
The Casa Battlo house that was inscribed in 2005 in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund may be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and splendid apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued the visits because they found it to be a lucrative business and they expanded the scope of visits to common areas and attic including roof terraces.
The entrance ticket to the monument is really cheap and costs 16.50 euros; students, retirees, groups and holders of tourist cards have 20 percent discount.
The sum is still above the entrance price to the other constructions of Gaudi in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic turrets, you need to quickly find a comrade among the residents of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mattress and a bedside table: women have other criteria than men.
No ostentatious frame, but rather the quality of the surface reserved for sleeping, so the mattress and the attic give a real basis for a good bed.
They must of course complement each other harmoniously to please a concrete user.
During the choice several things are decisive: weight, size, age, state of health as well as the sex of the owner.
The type of interior in which we will place the mattress and the bottom is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the country house where one does not constantly sleep latex mattresses are not suitable because they "warm up" gently.
They also have a higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If they also do not have enough ventilation channels at the heart and if they remain, in addition, on a solid board, they retain moisture. Mold can also form there.
The habit is also decisive in the choice.
Those who spend time abroad where very thick mattresses with a softening layer are frequently used, will hardly feel good on a low and hard surface.
“That’s how all the hockey players who come back from the NHL complain that they can’t sleep there.”
"For their tired shoulders, feet and ribs, they needed mattresses with a crumbling layer of lazy foam."
"Such mattresses are also recommended for people suffering from diabetes who have a disorder of the nervous system that therefore assume poorly "information" of the joints and skin," explains Sylva Adamczikova, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
This is why a few years ago the mattress with lazy foam conquered the hockey players as well as other customers.
"Today everything is going well, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex but also the Czech Tropico, for example, have appropriate mattresses.
You don't need to be an NHL guy to enjoy a lazy mousse.
This “miracle” simply works.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape depending on the heat absorbed or adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing puts pressure on you and you won’t turn around at night like after a tough match.
You just sleep better.
The lazy foam also works as a protection against squares.
For the choice of mattress according to your size, add the length of the feet, which is about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman of a size of 180cm therefore need a bed of 210/220cm.
The minimum width for each for a double bed should be 90 cm or in total 180 cm.
For single beds, singles for example, it is recommended to take at least 120/140 cm.
It is convenient in case of a visit.
'However, it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when lying on the back you should lay your hands comfortably with the slightly bent elbows. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Bourreliers-matelassiers and decorators special who has devoted for several years to the problem of furniture and furniture.
For a two-seater bed each needs its own attic and mattress, so be careful however during the purchase to choose the height of the mattress well.
Otherwise, you will only have to mount the attic at different heights and this is not feasible on all bed frames.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, mattresses with springs at least 15 cm, of this count for the layer of shape and aeration at least three centimeters.
"When touching or sitting on the mattress you should not feel the springs," warns Helena Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a well-determined type of mattress.
The loft bed, when the mattress and loft are united like Siamese sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses were very poorly ventilated; it should not be washed, which is commonly done today.
And since during the night we normally sweat from 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress begins to resemble a large (and clogged) sieve.
For this, specialists refuse to make a claim for a lifetime of 25 years for a mattress or a lifetime warranty.
But it's all about her butt.
And for this an experience advice from the sellers: for a mattress of 120/140cm, for the coating of the mattress, for hygiene or washing, instead add a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash.
And although nowadays it is common to make coatings with zipper closure for the whole, that is to say that after opening you have two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine it is very important!) otherwise the manipulation for large models (and for one person) becomes a weight when you remove them on a weight.
Do you have a rigid board in your bed instead of a bedside table?
Oh, never!
Maximum for a bed intended for visitors for one night only.
However, equip the board (if there are no) with ventilation holes and use the spring mattress with a minimum height of 15cm with pocket springs (from Germany Taschenfederken) and a layer of ventilation.
A polyurethane mattress should not be part of a bed of this type.
For single-position lamella mattresses with 14/18 lamellas, latex mattresses or so-called sandwiches (perhaps the combination of latex and coconut), are ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more lamellas, 28 and above, where the lamellas'part of the lamella is doubled.
For multi-position mattresses it is not necessary to take spring mattresses because it does not respond to changes in position.
In addition to adjusting the rigidity of the slats, a shoulder cradle can also be installed.
This is a special joint of the slats that allows the slat to be pressed or even tilted so that the shoulder of the sleeper "fits" well.
For men who have “shoulders as wide as the back,” it’s really an important thing.
This thing is already being considered by mattress manufacturers who for the "males" began to use a softening area at the shoulder level.
But they also think of women - they again offer them a softer surface at the hips.
For the most difficult customer there are wing or wafer tops with what is called a multiforce suspension.
The pressure spreads to more points and decreases the tension.
But of course, beware, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and swollen with air) on good mattresses and sombrero, the "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is a simple pillow: the pillow must support the head and its tips must reach only the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm that Scandinavians by example prefer.
When lying on the side, the pillow should level (with the shoulder cradle of the mattress or the area tucked into the mattress) the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses still have something in common with the first ones based on straw and herbs.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also on the organic mattress.
Petroleum-based raw materials, from which polyurethane is produced, are replaced by natural oils, such as soybean oil, for example.
Almost all known manufacturers use soybeans.
“The Bio label for mattresses means that the heart is made from natural products,” explains Petr vasicek of the company Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for mattress coatings; one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop forest or lavender scents.
There are differences between man and woman.
While the birch plant extract so that the mattress coating absorbs heat and cools the body, "cools" the man, the coatings "warm" the women.
Red pepper extract accelerates blood circulation and is therefore warmer for the weak sex.
The current favorites?
Mattress made from cold foam (it has more pores with a disturbed cell structure so more breathable than standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different stiffnesses of cold foams gives polyzone mattresses that know exactly where the head, lower back and feet are located.
You will pay a quality mattress from 7000 crowns and more.
Those who are characterized by their health parameters have less VAT and are taken as instruments for health.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex reached the first place.
Saving for the mattress and the top is not easy.
From time to time, two mattresses can be purchased for the price of one as part of special actions by manufacturers or producers.
For example, the company Magniflex that offers Duofreeze mattresses with Memory foam sewn to the coating for 11990 crowns.
Of course, you can take the second one for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with an open cellular structure and a large thickness has been started with Tempur matter at a "cosmic" pace.
This began as a matter for NASA because the astronauts underwent the launch of huge charge factors.
Tempur is softened by heat and hardened, on the contrary, by cold.
It therefore adapts perfectly to the warm human body and distributes optimal pressure.
It is ideal for this against bad sleep and for an increase in comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for health products, such as special foot cushions that relieve the legs and venous system.
Czech manufacturers use, for example, EucathermC or Twinsaver foam or the same type.
Devices to track people are increasingly in demand by parents who want to monitor their children.
Fear for their child leads more and more people to think about monitoring them through a GPS.
The system, set up at the beginning to search for cars, can just as well be used to track the movement of people and help in some cases as for example that of little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as large as a matchbox but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of little Anicka moved a large number of people and they began to look for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not spying but just another way to reduce the likelihood of another tragedy," said Petr Pilin of the company MACRO Weil, which is one of the suppliers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I admit that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting it in the bag of a person who is not aware, but I have not yet encountered such cases."
“The majority of people are customers who actually buy the product for safety reasons,” Pilin adds.
According to him, children should always know for what purposes "the box" is used and how to use it in an emergency.
The child psychologist, Dana Bockova, draws attention to the fact that if the child does not want to wear such a thing on him, he will get rid of it.
“And even the little ones can show great creativity when it comes to deliberately getting rid of something when they don’t want to be under control.”
“Mobile phones, which can cut themselves like these tracking devices, have already led parents to long expectations,” says Bockova.
According to her, the fact that this type of device can help in case of aggression is very questionable.
"If this is a prepared kidnapping, the author will do everything so that the child does not have an electronic device that can locate him."
“Currently, it’s the phone.”
"As soon as the tracking devices are going to develop, they (the criminals) will be looking for them too because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign."
“In such cases, criminals will always be ahead of the police,” says the psychologist.
She still admits that such devices can help during an unprepared aggression by a pedophile.
According to Robert Cech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, says that having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the event of an assault.
"The apparatus may be set up in such a way that it is in regular broadcast after a specified period of time."
"In the event that the device is destroyed, it still remains the last position of the person concerned."
"The more expensive devices also have an inclinometer that immediately signals the position of the person who has slipped and is in the elongated position without moving," says Cech.
According to him, so-called smart phones that are equipped with a navigation system, can offer a comparable service after having formatted it with a special protocol.
The problem with current tracking systems is that it is either a device similar to those worn in pendants the size of a litter box or to the smallest telephone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to Pilina of the company Macro Weil, this is why tests are currently being conducted to make devices that look like common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that the potential aggressor will not be able to recognize the tracking device."
"Or he will realize it after a while, which will have given the police a little more time," he added.
Whether the tracking device is developed in the form of a bracelet or pendant, it will always use the same technology as for tracking cars.
It is a combination of GPS position acquisition systems (which is commonly used in self-navigation) and a mobile phone function that alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many detonating cords that it could tour the Czech Republic with, but it can only last two years.
The army bought for 445 km of cords used for explosives.
Already last year, the Ministry of Defence had purchased 224 km.
The army has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the lifespan of the cords is two to four years maximum.
The army bought detonating cords from the anonymous company STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff has given as a reason for the purchase of a huge amount of detonating cords to MF DNES that the soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the reserve calculations made by the army's pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES contacted, it appears that even the generals, officers with a command, secretaries or household staff should have an explosives exercise every year.
Alexandre Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vlastimil Picek, commander of the army are no exception.
Only to argue the army's annual consumption of 60 km of detonating cords.
At this distance corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if it were true, the army reserves could support it for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it would be true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals it is enough not more than 2 m of detonating cords, as experts say, this means that the army with its new purchase has ensured - together with the consumption of special units and engineering - reserves for the mentioned 225 years.
However, the soldiers of the Rapid Intervention Brigade have recently complained to Minister Vondra that they have almost no ammunition for their handguns and that shooting sessions are limited due to the need for money.
There is no mention of the lack of clothing.
“And I don’t mind if they buy such a large amount of detonating cords from us.”
“And that’s their decision and they really know what they’re doing.”
"For us the military is a good customer that we strive as merchants to please," says STV Group Chief Commercial Officer Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, argues that the army will have these "munitions" in reserve for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group, however, reports only four years of life of the detonating cords and the police and army pyrotechnicians of only two years.
"If they are perfectly stored in the depots, it can even go up to four years," says one two who does not want his name published in light of the army's criticism.
The life span passed, each ammunition must be tested to see if it remains intact and does not threaten the life of the soldier.
However, these tests are not free and still cost money.
The other argument of the department is a reduction due to the quantity for 445 km of detonating cords.
"They cost us 60 percent less than last year's 245 km supply," said spokesman Pejsek, who interprets the opinion of the defense ministry's buyers.
Just to compare: the annual consumption of the detonating cords of the police pyrotechnicians that neutralize the munitions of the Second World War or those after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1500 meters.
And the police still only order the necessary amount of ammunition to be used before the end of their life.
This has been established for the safety of pyrotechnicians and in order to be able to more flexibly obtain more modern and reliable types of detonating cords.
the defense ministry today has big problems for the neutralization of tens of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand men was preparing to move, heading for the Rhine.
What awaits in a few years this Czech army that MF DNES contacted: neutralize hundreds of kilometers of old detonating cords that it buys today "cheaply".
To this day, I take advantage of the contacts I got through the competitions.
The franchise sale of his hotel has helped Lukas Pytloun to win the Best Individual Entrepreneur competition.
The winner of last year’s Best Individual Entrepreneur competition was 28-year-old Lukas Pytloun.
His adventure to success is like in a movie.
Lukas Pytloun loved to travel.
And abroad, he realized that in Libérec there was a lack of a quality hosting site at a reasonable price.
From his savings on what he had earned when working abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small building of 5 apartments half demolished.
Knowing that he was still a student in the third year of graduate school, it was a courageous action.
"The relationship between the quality and price of accommodation in our region has made me want to do something," says Lucas Pytloun.
He began renting the first apartment rebuilt to foreign workers.
He reinvests the profit in the building that he transformed into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, his entrepreneurial action has allowed him to open in Libérec 4 guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of almost 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, another of the same quality happened to him.
“We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrava U Tise where we sold our franchise concept and other Pytloun hotel franchise candidates showed up,” the number 1 entrepreneurs last year.
"And for the sale of the license for the commissioning of a large-scale hotel the victory in the competition of the entrepreneur of the year has served well," adds Pytloun with appreciation.
The victory brought him more popularity and to be known in Liberec and its surroundings.
“People recognized me on the streets, often congratulated me and, I must say, it was very nice,” he recalls.
It recommends participation in this contest to all those who are striving to do something.
It is not necessary to win but every opportunity to be visible is good.
He says he is still using his contacts and knowledge that he could not have obtained in any other way.
“With those I met through the competition, I started to maintain business relationships regularly.
According to him, success-related fame also had an impact on employees.
And he's about 70.
"I see in them above all the loyalty and pride of having engaged in something that has been generally recognized."
"This is not, by and large, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work of all of us together.
“Only my name is pushed forward,” said Lucas Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successor a better year than the one we had at Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the objective sense of the winner Farmet has the worst moments behind him.
The one who came to Slovansky for the first place of the contest for the Firm of the Year organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the company Farmet.
The jury rewarded the efforts with which it transformed a tooling workshop in Ceska Skalice into a firm with a turnover of 100 million crowns.
“I can say that the award has encouraged not only me but also my employees and increased our self-confidence to fight against the competition,” said the winner of last year’s competition.
At the beginning of the history of the company Farmet there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state proposed to the father of Karel Zdrasky to rent the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of goods by the communists, he did not hesitate for a long time, refused a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and created a company with a few comrades in the entourage of his father in the barn.
Not long after they began to specialize in presses for vegetable oil.
After eighteen years, it became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company was known even in the non-specialized public after the success achieved in the contest through the media.
“Not only have our customers started to really get to know the Farmet brand better but also foreign partners who have begun to realize that they are working with a company that has achieved the greatest success in its home country,” says Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year did not happen at Farmet only in the euphoria of victory.
The assessment of the company was based on the economic results of 2008 and partly of 2009.
And it was precisely in 2009 that this was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machinery.
At the height of the crisis, which did not really affect citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and start limiting their purchases of new equipment and technology.
"We have obviously not escaped from this situation."
“The turnover fell by 40 percent, and we had to limit our production and even lay off,” Zdarsky said.
A viable society must know that from time to time unpopular measures must be taken.
But they handled the situation properly and retained beneficial results even though they were lower than they had before the crisis.
However, at Farmet, they continued to invest uncompromisingly in research and development.
“We have built a training and research center with the endowments, strengthened the company’s presentation at international trade fairs and won major awards at national exhibitions,” says Zdarsky.
Everything suggests that the crisis is behind them.
The numbers of affies go up and with them the number of employees as well.
“To the new winner I wish this pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere,” says Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that removes foolish regulations.
The Absurdity of the Year investigation is a part of the business clan for the fourth time.
Some absurd regulations could have been abolished.
This year's infamous winner of the Absurdity of the Year survey was the obligation to bring in the offices documents that officials can obtain online.
More than a third of the 4,000 voters voted for it.
For example, the social affairs administration was asking for a paper extract from the trade register while the grievor can get it in two clicks of the mouse.
It changes thanks to the investigation.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer request an extract from the trade register for insurance payment checks," said Jana Buranova, spokesman for the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
To highlight all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must fulfill in the Czech Republic and to remove those that are absurd is the meaning of this competition of the Absurdity of the Year.
This investigation is again this year for the fourth time a part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and has even greater popularity.
If last year 3,000 voters came out, at least 4,000 this year brought their vote.
And it is not surprising, there are in our country the most diverse legal obligations that only slow down the company, and, this, more and more.
"We may be among the documents to be filled in for tax returns to the top places in the world," says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneurial activity has become a stated goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the whole world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is in 74th place in terms of conditions for the company, which is 8 places more than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year contest was first established in 2006 and continues every year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report every year the administrative and bureaucratic absurdities from April to the end of September, the last deadline before the closing of the competition.
To report there is the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then, the organizer of the contest selects seven candidates for the "anti-price" and lets the public vote during the month of October on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and on www.ihned.cz.
The Absurdity that received the largest number of votes is declared victorious.
Until the last survey last year, there were about a hundred, or more precisely 105 regulations and decrees that lost their sense of existence.
The comments are sent by the entrepreneurs but also the trade unions and the teachers.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, therefore, among the nominees there is, for example, the obligation that motorway and highway maintenance vehicles pay tolls, or that contractors with twenty employees repaint two offices and two toilets every two years.
The list of seven proposals is published on the contest website.
The proclamation of the contest, which always begins at the beginning of November on Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of a happening in which political and public figures regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, director of the Association for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises of the Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the culmination of the competition.
"Economic prosperity cannot work when the state puts <0xC3><0xA2>tons in the legs of entrepreneurs and for that my goal is to remove, every year, at least three dozen paragraphs that today only complicate the business," said Martin Kokourek, the Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to suppress absurd decrees is not a swordsmanship in the water.
In 2007, what people did not like was the obligation of entrepreneurs to declare three days in advance at the office for the individual company at the place where the company is located, the intention to go to an exhibition or a pilgrimage with a stand.
This obligation was abolished with the amendment of the Individual Business Act.
The second most popular obligation in 2007, which was to report to the Labour Office a 30-day service trip for a foreign employee, was removed with the so-called Green Card Act.
And everything is fine until the third session of the contest.
The Absurdity of the Year 2009 was the decree for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their office, a refrigerator and two automatic scales.
This was changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year—the obligation to have a refrigerator was removed.
A new category rewards socially responsible firms.
Environmental, humanitarian, training or sports projects are evaluated.
The novelty of this year’s competition of Hospodarske Noviny, which already exists for 5 years, is the category called the Responsible Firm of the year 2010.
The objective of this competition is to support reasonable and fair business.
"We want to support companies that monitor their company's environmental impacts and conduct socially responsible business," said Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone operator, Vodaphone, who is the guarantor and promoter of this competition, as in the case of the contest for the rebel of the year.
For this first year of this sub-category of the contest of the company of the year 2010, organized by the company Vodaphone, have registered the companies that do not have success with a single long-term goal for the company.
The adventure of each of them is rich in inspiration and an independent article would be to edit.
Although the purpose of their business is different from each other, their supportive and predictive activity can be considered as the denominator of their efforts.
In one case, this concerns persons with disabilities and their employees' personal or health problems.
Among the fourteen finalists for the whole of the Czech Republic is not an example of the Prague prologue company Et Netera which supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in a number of tournaments in different sports disciplines.
Another example of a firm responsible for the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor to the staffing fund that sponsors children with disabilities for 17 years.
Taking care of employees with health problems, we can also cite the old Podebrad paper factory, which employs more than 70 percent of them and who, for this, obtained the title of the firm Responsible for the Central Bohemian region and who placed third in the region in the competition of the Firm of the year organized by Vodaphone.
In Olomouc, it is MiRyz Soft, a financial company, that has won for introducing flexible working hours and even reduced them to 35 hours per week on average and, this, without, proportionally, a reduction in wages.
The jury also awarded it the title because it buys primarily from Czech manufacturers, supports a civic activity in the surrounding area and is concerned with the environment.
“We strive to recycle as much as possible so that our business and administration have the least impact on the environment,” said Miluse Ryznarova, Executive Director of the company.
the company responsible IT Enlogit of the Region of Usti also thinks about the health of its employees and has set up for each laptop an ergonomic chair and keyboard, encourages their work at home and uses the catering services of a local protected factory for its actions.
"We also support the Foundation The Man in the Shadow who helps the local Roma community," said Ondrej Suchy, the company's representative.
At the very last rank is, also for its activities, a company of Laundry and cleaning of the region of Karlovy Vary, which participates in the pension insurance of its employees in the form of bonuses above the standards.
"In our society we contribute to food, transportation, increasing qualifications and leisure," says Joseph Strapac of the construction company Bruntal Czasch, winner for the Moravian-Silesian region.
All regional finalists for the Vodaphone Firm of the Year contest, who had responded to the attached questionnaires of the registration document and had returned it to the organizer before August 15, were automatically registered in the Responsible Company category.
Incomplete or incorrect answers in the questionnaire were withdrawn from the competition by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the firms in competition had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the competition of the firm responsible but were not disqualified from the competition "main" the Firm of the year of Vodaphone".
“Independent registrations are not possible because it is a subcategory of the Firm’s main competition of the year,” explains Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison&Rose.
At the Land Fund in Plzen, the police made arrests during a public contest
In the building of the Land Fund in Plzen, the anti-corruption police have made arrests in recent days.
The detectives handed over the handcuffs to the local contractor and real estate merchant Lubos.
The latter had endeavoured to manipulate a public call for tenders for the settlement of a return application in such a way that the proposed land would be obtained by a particular candidate.
He had to pay Lubos G. half a million crowns.
"At the moment, I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting a person for insider's misconduct as part of a public tender and competition," Plzen prosecutor Antonie Zelena told the Pravo newspaper, knowing that it is forbidden to provide further explanations as the investigation is ongoing.
Police released the 46-year-old contractor after 24 hours.
To find out how it could influence a public competition, one can only speculate in light of so little official information.
On a question from Pravo, Lubomira Cerna, a spokeswoman for the Land Fund, said the police had actually been arrested in Plzen at a separate workplace during the public contest.
"It was a customer and in no case an employee," she said.
The public competition according to Cerna has the real name "Call to propose rights for the transfer of land according to the Land Act" and is set up when several eligible candidates appear.
"These persons propose, in the context of the appeal, a higher value of their restitution rights that must be settled before the value of the land is announced."
“According to the proposed rights, a ranking of the acquirers is set up and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who proposed the highest rights,” the fund’s spokesman said.
Lubos G. had, it is clear, information about the persons who had registered for the appeal and, as he is himself, also a person bévilare because having purchased a large number of refund rights, he had proposed to candidates in the field not to participate in the competition.
And he probably got caught up in the fact that he was leaving.
That would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his interrogation.
Lubos G. had contacts far above the standards at the FdT (Land Fund).
It was in the case of the former head of the FdT Vaclav Sankot who was prosecuted for editing land for which the decision to set up a construction had already been edited.
It was precisely Lubos G. who had obtained, for example, land for the construction of public communications, concretely in the place where the access artery to the industrial area of Borske Pole was to be built.
Later he exchanged it with the town hall for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is far superior.
The town hall was forced to accept because otherwise it risked putting the construction in jeopardy by a blockade of the land.
Households will pay an additional one hundred crowns per month for housing.
Starting in January, households will have to pay a supplement not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places rents will also increase.
As of January, families will have to draw up to a hundred crowns a month more from their wallets than now.
Electricity increases by 4.6 percent, gas by almost 2 percent more expensive, in some localities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supply and in many places central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity is expected to be close to 100 crowns per annum for households in apartments than currently.
However, all suppliers have lowered electricity prices due to the sensitive development to encourage the production of renewable energies, including photovoltaic batteries.
Gas increases moderately but of course at the time when people need it most to heat and thus have the highest consumption.
One can also count a hundred crowns in addition.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from city to city.
It is mainly the largest municipalities that plan to increase prices.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay almost 50 crowns more per month from January onwards, while families in Liberec will pay more than 1000 crowns per year.
For residents of Prague is preparing a 9 percent increase in water and sanitation in case the city increases infrastructure rents.
If the rents do not change the thresholds will pay an additional 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague will still be among the lowest in comparison with the whole country.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation are up 7.4 percent.
For example, rent prices will rise significantly in the 450,000 apartments rented from January, i.e. at the end of the regulation.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns almost 2500 apartments in Usti nad Labem, decided to increase it to 100 percent.
Those who will not agree with the new rent increase will be brought before the courts by the company.
Regulated rents paid by people in nearly 300,000 apartments could increase by 10 percent next year.
Czech children get drunk with rum and fernet. Beer is no longer fashionable and acts all gently.
Fernet, rum, vodka and exceptionally also the best brand of whisky are stolen from parents.
These are drinks that most often bring those who are drunk, who are not yet fifteen years old, into the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated in the hospital for recurrence are no exception.
This is a result of the experience of doctors who encounter cases similar to admissions from hospital children's departments.
“Beers or wines are no longer fashionable because it takes time to get drunk.”
'The trend is really to strong alcohols,' says Pravo Ludek Pelikan, Head of Children's Department at Horovice Hospital in Central Bohemia.
“When they manage to chip a bottle in the closet, it’s sometimes whiskey, but it’s the fernet and vodka that prevail.”
"Wodka has the advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and thus not feel it," explains the head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, a spokeswoman for the Motol Hospital, also gives her reason.
"In general, it's rum or fernet."
"It's today fashionable alcohol, especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases, it was slivovice that they brought back from the house," Jurinova added.
According to the head of the Pelikan department, seeing drunken children between the ages of thirteen and fourteen at hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice since last year, he was in Motol where he spent ten years in paediatrics, where ambulances brought completely drunk schoolchildren from the wide area.
"A young girl was hospitalized four times.
"She began her career at the age of twelve when she was brought in with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in the blood with in addition a mixture with ecstasy," the doctor described this particularly important case.
"She was at the Holesovice Exhibition Park at a party."
"What's interesting is that it didn't seem strange to the mother that her daughter was absent for 48 hours," said the director of the department.
It is precisely the disinterest of the parents or their extraordinary tolerance for the fact that their rejections are given to the drink that is the main cause of the development of alcoholism of children.
According to experts, however, we do not talk about dependence, in its strict sense, for children.
“Under the term alcohol we mean a chronic alcohol dependence of several years with all the phenomena that result from it but that we do not find in children.”
"In those who use repetitive alcohol, it is rather a significantly unfavorable socio-family background," explained the head of the Pelikan Department.
According to spokeswoman Jurinova, about forty drunken children were hospitalized this year until mid-November in the pediatric clinic in Motol.
Only cases with severe intoxication requiring hospitalization are included in the statistics.
Drunk children who are brought home after emergency care by their parents or by the police are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children sitting and drinking a bottle of alcohol after school, according to Pelikan, there are three seasonal waves with which one can count: the day of the witches, Saint Sylvester and the end of the school year.
"Either they drink despite bad results or on the contrary they celebrate the beginning of the holidays."
"Of course I experienced on witches' day an admission of seven drunken children at a time," Pelikan said.
The drunken child who spent the night in the hospital in detoxification under medical supervision is paradoxically in a better position than the one who returned home and suffers the next day from the "mouth of wood".
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body needs.
“They’re better off because they spend a great evening and then a sweet awakening and nothing hurts them.”
“They’re just amazed at where they are,” Pelikan adds, knowing that from time to time it spoils the good mood of patients at least with the note to pay for their care.
Ambulance transport and hospitalization on intensive care beds can cost up to tens of thousands of crowns.
"From time to time, I applied this as a means of education by telling these children how much their intoxication cost and that they could spend the whole summer in seasonal work to pay off a single evening," Pelikan added.
However, according to him, health insurance companies in their regressive management, which are expected to recover care-related burdens from parents, do not treat cases of drunken children.
Two L-159 aircraft are in foreign hands in Spain for the first time.
Two of the five L-159s, against which the Ministry of Defense exchanged Casa C-295M transport aircraft, took off Tuesday for Seville, Spain, where aircraft manufacturer Casa-EADS is based.
This is the first time that such devices have become the property of someone other than the Czech army.
However, they have been abroad in the course of exercises or demonstration flights.
These are the two-seat versions of the L-159T1 that were previously in service in the Czech Army and were in flight.
The remaining three aircraft are single-seat versions of the L-159.
These are currently parked at Aero Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - the firm Omnipol - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the press department of the Ministry of Defense, the physical departure of the Vodochody aircraft is currently unknown.
"The L-159 single-seater aircraft planned for the exchange were taken from long-stocked aircraft without causing any additional charges or investments for the Ministry of Defence."
"The L-159 T1 two-seaters have been exchanged in the state," Pravo Pejsek said.
He joked that the army will not be without two seats since the ministry signed in May 2009 with Aero Vodochody an agreement worth 200 million crowns for the transformation of four unused L-159 single-seaters into two two-seaters.
The army took delivery of the first aircraft in July, with the second scheduled for delivery later this year.
According to Pejsek, EADS is committed to introducing the aircraft into the equipment of some Alliance countries.
“The contract clearly states that the one who takes the L-159s into account is EADS and that they will be used for training pilots from NATO member countries.”
"It is therefore the case of the one who is considering how to achieve this," Pejsek said.
Hospodarske noviny announced, some time ago, that the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Department of Defense did not issue a call for tenders and contacted EADS directly.
The Defense Department then argued that the exchange ensures a future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 aircraft from Aero Vodochody and only uses 24, wanting to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft is likely to have legal implications.
The European Commission, however, filed a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence with the European Court of Justice because the aircraft should have been selected as part of a European-wide call for tenders and in no case by contacting a manufacturer directly.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa planes, the last one is expected to arrive at Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
An index longer than the annular is a sign of low risk of cancer
Men who have the index longer than the annular are at a lower risk of having prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
This may depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our findings show that relative finger length serves as a simple test for prostate cancer risk, particularly for men before age 60," said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University.
The finger could help determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, including by combining it with genetic risk or other aggravating factors such as family health history, Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009 she followed with her colleagues in Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had the index of the right hand shorter than the annular.
For them as for the 19 percent of those who had fingers of the same length, the same probability of prostate cancer was found.
In the case of those who had the index longer than the annular risk, however, fell to 33 percent, for men before the age of 60 the decrease in risk reached 87 percent.
The length ratio of the two fingers cited - formed during the prenatal period - indicates in particular different levels of sex hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index.
Previous research had shown that it is precisely testosterone that helps in the development of prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, told CTK that he is aware of the study but does not believe that the relationship between finger length and cancer is "fully demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is under snow, the D1 and D5 motorways are closed.
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered in snow on Thursday morning.
On roads and sidewalks, there is mostly compact snow, clearers have worked all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between the 89th and 93rd kilometers in the direction of Rozvadov due to several truck and car accidents and the D1 road in Brno in the direction of Prague suffers the same fate.
The dispatcher of the Automobile Club Central (UAMK) told the information
At the 91st kilometer a truck was injured, at the 93rd two heavy vehicles were hit, the accident caused injuries.
Several cars were also found in the ditch.
The problems are also on the D1 motorway at 185th kilometer towards Prague.
Two trucks were hit by it.
Drivers should leave just after Brno at the 190th kilometer or go through Brno and then enter at the 182th kilometer in Kyvalka.
A line of cars of several kilometers was formed at this place.
Also on the D11 motorway, there is an accident and, this, just on arrival in Prague.
In Prague, there is a layer of snow several centimeters thick, thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
Rows of cars are created, for example, in Prosek, the street Sterboholska is also crowded.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Trams are late, for example, on the line between Charles Square (Karlove Namesti) and Peace Square (Namesti Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague Crisis Staff is yet to meet.
Railways and the airport also face problems.
The Czech Railways have already had to remove because of the snow 7 fast links.
The lines for example from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroun have problems
Travellers should monitor the current situation.
Ruzyne Airport has been closed since Wednesday 11:00 a.m. until 5 a.m.
Most roads in South Moravia are already rolling but doubling vigilance.
On the road to Vyskov, three side roads are impractical, on the road to Brno there begins to be snowstorms in places and on the road to Blansko the chains are mandatory to pass certain lines of communication in the places placed above.
The Vyskov region was one of the most affected places.
So far the axes are closed: Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saratice-Milesovice
To clean them, you may need to send snow blowers and snow strawberries.
We can't predict when they'll be rolling.
On the Hodonin road, caution is exercised in the White Carpathian region.
On roads that are, with respect to nature protection, maintained only by spraying inert products, there is still a layer of 5 centimeters of snow warns CTK.
In the Czech Republic, it fell between two to 10 centimeters of snow; it fell the most in northern Bohemia, with, often, up to 18 centimeters of snow.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, up to 15 centimeters of snow fell.
The snowfall is gradually disappearing in the Czech Republic.
Americans have a new “smart weapon”
The U.S. military has sent a new “smart” weapon to Afghanistan, known only as code XM-25.
The generals believe that this new automatic rifle will have an influence on the conflict there with the Taliban and "will change the game" to their advantage.
The new weapon is like a super-precise cannon
Its projectiles are guided by laser with a precision of a few meters.
The special ammunition of caliber 25 mm developed for this rifle and containing a highly crushing explosive, actually works like small grenades.
The munitions can be programmed in such a way that they will explode at the contact of the target but also at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
It can therefore be used against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle, a wall or a ditch.
It is also not protected from above and when a deadly rain of steel bursts falls on it, it can also put it out of action.
According to Richard Audette, who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "intelligent" technology.
"The soldier essentially uses it in such a way that he finds the target, sends him a laser beam that determines the distance, thus obtains a precise point of view, according to which he corrects his target site and presses on the relaxation.
"Let's say you aimed at 543 meters."
"When you press the trigger, the weapon loads and fires at a distance of 543 meters plus or minus 1, 2, 3 meters," Audette said.
400 jobs relocated
The Fujitsu Group relocates its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
Next year in July, 400 employees will move their workplace to Astro Park, which is currently located at the office building at Mareinbader Square in the Bad Homburg region.
The Japanese group Fujitsu relocates its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the computer manufacturing and maintenance giant said on Wednesday, next year in July, the 400 men and women’s workplace, located so far on the Marienbader square in the city of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, a huge office complex located on Lyoner Straße in Frankfurt’s Niederrad district.
A Fujitsu spokeswoman explained that in the medium term, the group is expected to bring together another 100 jobs still scattered so far in the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive, and Astro Park’s open-plan offices are better suited to the way employees work.
In Bad Homburg too, Fujitsu was just a tenant.
Managing Director Bernd Wagner said: “Frankfurt-Niederrad is a prime location for us with remarkable infrastructure.”
He argues that the connection to the airport is precisely of great importance for a global company like Fujitsu.
The relocation of a major company within the region yesterday aroused the joy of the winners and caused the disappointment of the losers.
The head of economic affairs of the municipality of Frankfurt, Mr. Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again, a "planetary actor" had been conquered in this way.
It is an "extraordinary profession of faith relating to the place of implantation".
Fujitsu is suitable for the city and its establishment is an important impetus for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Mr. Michael Korwisi (the Greens), regrets Fujitsu’s decision.
The management informed the municipality of this intention very early on.
“It goes without saying that we have offered our assistance to this company,” Korwisi said.
However, the friendly relations could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer in dealing with the owner of the building in the Marienbader Square.
In the end, economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now a matter of avoiding that such an exceptional place remains unoccupied for a long time.
"I hope that the owner and tenant of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the building of the Town Hall Square, used until now by the Fujitsu company and the neighboring "small vertical", as well as the rest of the buildings of the Marienbad Square, were part of the controversial construction project of the spa.
As a result of a joint municipal project and a private project developer, a new entrance to the city was created between the station and the City Hall, which was criticized not only for the impressive layout of the areas that used to be partly car parked, but also for the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the rating and investment advisory firm, Feri, the computer manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as Fujitsu, the computer manufacturer at the time still associated with Siemens, moved into the buildings.
In 2006, the German Frankfurt group Immobilien-Chancen bought the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the real estate fund Morgan Stanley. A year later, these buildings were resold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu Group, headquartered in Tokyo, considers itself the third largest supplier of computer products in the world.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to businesses and also provides essential service.
Its branch office in the Rhine-Main region is one of the largest in Germany: Fujitsu certainly has many more employees in Munich.
The subsidiary, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to move to Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other subsidiaries present on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this, 7,000 square meters have rented in the Astro Park building.
This twenty-year-old complex, whose name recalls its star-shaped plan, houses, among other things, the headquarters of the Confederation of Electronic and Electrotechnical Industries.
Amazon's Expulsion from the Server - Threats against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks is experiencing more and more difficulties.
The Internet service provider Amazon has expelled from its servers the site specialized in the disclosure of confidential documents.
This attitude may hide the political pressures endured after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
Wikileaks founder Mr. Assange is reportedly in England.
In the United States, the Wikileaks site is being attacked with increasing force.
The group of cyber-activists “Wikileaks” no longer has access to its server hosted so far in America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is wanted by Interpol, is likely staying in Britain, according to newspaper reports.
"Wikileaks excluded from Amazon server."
"Freedom of speech in the country of freedom," the cyber activists behind the revelations said on Twitter on Wednesday.
Shortly before, the cyber company, Amazon, had deleted Wikileaks documents from its servers.
After the publication of the secret diplomatic notes, cyber activists used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to reach as many documents as possible.
Wikileaks tweeted: “Great, our dollars are now spent on caring for people in Europe.”
When freedom of expression poses a problem for Amazon, “they should stop selling books.”
CNN, citing Mr. Liebermann’s office, reported that Amazon banned Wikileaks from using its servers after the investigation by Senator Joe Lieberman’s collaborators.
The chairman of the Senate Committee on the Protection of the Territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against him, the British newspaper, The Guardian, reported.
"I would have liked Amazon to take this action earlier in view of previous Wikileaks publications of classified information," the senator said.
At the same time, Liebermann called on other countries to refuse the use of servers by the platform.
"Wikileaks is acting in an illegal, monstrous and unscrupulous manner, putting our national security at risk and life at risk around the world," the independent senator said in a statement.
“No company aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks disseminate the contents of the stolen documents.”
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, is on Interpol’s wanted list.
According to the London newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian lives in the UK and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber-activist has consistently called intrigues orchestrated by his critics the prosecutions initiated against him by Sweden.
Wikileaks spokeswoman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that threats had been made against the site.
“There have even been calls for the murder of Julian Assange.”
This is why Assange is particularly concerned about his safety, Hrafnsson said.
This is also why the founder of Wikileaks continues to hide.
Hrafnsson was clearly responding to statements made in North America.
In America, former Arkansas Republican governor Mike Huckabee has demanded that the person responsible for the revelations made by Wikileaks be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, the adviser to the head of government, Stephen Harper, told television, apparently ironically, that Mr. Assange should be “killed” and that Mr. Obama could “use a drone.”
Meanwhile, a controversy erupted between the White House and Mr. Assange.
U.S. President Barack Obama's spokesman Robert Gibbs called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange demanded Secretary of State Hilary Clinton's resignation if she was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and only recently disclosed that she was engaged in espionage activities.
"I don't know exactly why we have to deal with the opinion of an individual who owns a website," Gibbs said.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than the claims of a website.”
The U.S. government is now completely shifting the protection of its databases to the test bench.
According to a White House statement, Russell Travers, deputy director of the Center for Counter-Terrorism, was named responsible for fighting leaks.
Travers is tasked with implementing the “necessary structural reforms” made necessary after Wikileaks’ disclosure of diplomatic cables.
The White House is also keen to verify the means by which the entire administration is exchanging and protecting information.
In addition, the U.S. government has announced that it wants to take care of the security of dissidents and activists should they ever be threatened by Wikileaks revelations.
"We have done everything we can to get in touch with them," State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
"We are ready to protect them if it proves necessary."
The University of the Ice
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice cream confectioners are prepared for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day introductory course for future glaciers was very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
By the way, where does all the ice come from?
Glacier and ice machine.
The glacier, i.e. in German the somewhat outdated ice confectioner, makes the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of ice making.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the refrigerated display case using a spatula, places it in the waffle, and then starts selling it.
To find out, you do not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice can not avoid "Gelato-University" of the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The sorbet maker founded the University of Ice Cream in 2003 so that the ice creams coming out of its machines meet the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day introductory course for future glaciers was very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
There are also special courses on chocolate ice cream for several days, as well as hands-on sessions in the private ice cream parlor.
In the midst of the crisis of the forties, a number of people dream of a new career, others just risk to realize their burning desire on the smooth ice.
This time, 40 participants came from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia and Hungary.
Jacky, a teacher of art education from California, is proud of the Slow Food movement and wants to offer a quality European product in the country of Industrial Ice in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business management consultant and she wants, after a few years, to draw something unique from this challenging profession for the nerves.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream parlor in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian housewife came because her children love Italian ice cream.
Glacier master Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of perfect ice.
Determining not only good taste, but also silky flexibility and good consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during the formation the cherry on the cake of the national superstructure and, in general, of the south: "Italian ice cream is simply the best: and then it still retains a sacred dose of romance."
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that heats up to 85 degrees thanks to an electronic program, then immediately cools to four degrees.
He then opens a tap installed on the machine: he draws out a pasteurized white cream base, the foundation of all kinds of milk ice cream.
The trainer is immediately attacked by the question: Is it possible to make ice using only natural substances without stabilizer?
How can one give free rein to the personal pleasure of experimentation?
Mr Luciano warns against being misled by the spirit of time.
One who speaks only of ice cream "made from natural ingredients", may have nevertheless used stabilizers: most often a natural product, for example, guar seed flour obtained from guar bean.
It is obviously possible to make ice without using a stabilizer, only it must be sold within 24 hours, otherwise it will collapse and the customer will not chew anything but ice pellets.
Some modifications of the base mass are allowed.
It becomes more exciting with the aromas.
The master Luciano makes the difference between the ingredients you buy in the fruit or confectionery department of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powder and pasta.
"suppliers will all try to get you dozens of flavored ingredients."
"However, you should just try."
Either in the recipes of fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Either in ice creams made from the white base mass which, by adding eggs to it, becomes a yellow cream and forms, when cocoa powder is added, the basis of all possible desserts to chocolate.
Now, all participants in the course must switch to the use of ice machines.
Luciano invites them from time to time to make four kinds of ice cream: vanilla, chocolate, moka and hazelnut with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla flavor or other natural ingredients.
The different types of fruit ice cream are also subjected to the same experiment.
More aromatic substances, more fruit purees: from the point of view of taste, this is not absolutely better.
Hazelnut ice does not necessarily have the taste of walnut, when it is composed mostly of hazelnuts.
Kiwi ice cream, which is very popular, is made from the group using more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
“Only a balanced mixture correctly highlights the taste of an ice cream,” Luciano says.
Making ice cream is a calculation exercise: if you use fish puree with a lot of sugar, you need to reduce the amount of sugar in the basic recipe.
A supplement of sugar is necessary for lemon ice cream.
Luciano presents an apparatus with which he determines the sugar content of the different types of fruit (the winegrowers use it to measure the degree of Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make the calculations easier.
The manufacture of ice no longer requires, as in the past, as much physical intervention.
It is not only the automatic manufacturing machine of the basic mass that helps.
There is also an apparatus in which the available ice mixture is simultaneously beaten to make it smooth and brought back to negative temperatures.
Despite all the automations, slight failures are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo rubs fruit puree from head to toe and, thus, splashes his fellow students when the control of the colossal bowl mixer escapes him.
Luciano said: “Such an incident is likely to happen at every class: it’s only a matter of time.”
Controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry that experiments with the cultivation of genetically modified plants has nucleated the European Food Safety Authority.
This accusation is now being made by the expert group Testbiotech which is considered an independent institute for the assessment of the consequences of biotechnology.
“It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we’ve learned a lot,” Testbiotech Director Christoph Then said Wednesday in Munich.
Some reports indicate that the chairman of the EFSA Group of Experts on Genetically Modified Plants, Mr. Harry Kuiper, and other EFSA experts are under contract with the Ilsi Press Group.
The latter is financed by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has been instrumental in the development of the EFSA test requirements for genetically modified plants and is therefore clearly in a conflict of interest situation, according to the criticisms made by Mr. Then.
The drafted requirements correspond, in paragraphs, to the positions taken by the Ilsi pressure group and thus bear the trade mark of the industry which, in essence, would be controlled by the authorities established in Parma, Italy.
This is already the second time that Testbiotech has denounced a conflict of interest.
A senior EFSA official recently joined the Swiss agri-food group Syngenta without conditions or a transitional period. In doing so, she changed camp.
Not long ago, even the Central German Radio (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) revealed the existence of personal relations between the European Union's supervisory authority and the industrial lobby, which aroused suspicions both of the German Federal Environment Agency and of MEPs.
However, EFSA does not accept the existence of any conflict of interest.
One opinion indicates that all reliable data is used, including industry data, as long as it is of good professional quality.
Experts working on behalf of EFSA are not prohibited from making contact with this sector of activity.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he works for the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) based in the United States.
It sees itself as a neutral forum bringing together experts from, among others, science, industry and politics to assess the risks of biotechnology without being a lobbyist.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Then disapprove of the fact that genetically modified plants are accepted without any animal feeding tests and that the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
"We want to know, for example, what are the impacts of genetically modified corn cause in the field," says Mr. Then.
The current practice is to test only the isolated proteins and not the entire genetically modified plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If we don't look for the risks, how can we discover them?" asked Mr. Then in an accusatory tone.
This is also the view of Ms. Angelika Hilbeck.
This scientist has been doing research since 1994 in the field of genetics and is currently working at the Polytechnic School of Zurich.
In this region, as in the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
That is why there are hardly any researchers who are not related to societies.
In the opinion of the companies, the critical studies would not be published.
Ms. Hilbeck says that “industry controls safety research.”
The Trace of Stone
Uli Gsell obtained it, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday afternoon, she was standing in front of the Stuttgart station with her tube on her back.
There was manifesto.
It was snowing.
The story is known: By September, excavators had come and started demolishing much of the north wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: several thousand people protested against the S21 project, transforming the Stuttgart central station into a multi-billion-dollar underground station.
Much of the wing was in ruins when the demonstrations resulted in the cessation of construction work.
Broken in 6000, 7000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (the shell limestone) of Crailsheim, a soft and coarse pavement poorly built between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor living in Ostfildern.
He got a few fragments of it.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He enthusiastically declares: "a modest and cheap rock, simple and terrestrial."
He claimed that by cutting it with a saw, he smelled the cigarette smoke.
He still doesn't know what he's going to do with this fragment.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
traces of the Stuttgart stones lead to an old French army munitions depot in a forest near Tübingen, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
This 44-year-old man trades in old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were crushed or if they disappear into the dump," he said in his office in a hut that was once a guard post.
He says he was insulted and threatened when in September the newspapers reported that he had bought the rest of the north wing from the demolition company.
But he negotiated for days with opponents of the S21 project.
And he explained to them that he could do nothing at all to oppose the demolition.
And if it takes place, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue to use the stone.
About 200 opponents of the S21 project subsequently won one of the parallelepipeds of stone weighing an average of 80 kilograms, the value of which ranges between 6.50 and 14 Euros.
Some keep it as a memory in while also hoping to be able to return it during a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full truck loads.
About half is still stuck in the forest, the rest being sold for a long time.
Owners of gardens, landscape gardeners, Individuals.
They came from everywhere and took everything that could get into the trunk and the trailers.
These Stuttgart scandal stones have long been transformed into "Mäuerle" or limitations of herb beds.
"By the way, this stone is nothing special," says Mr. Rongen.
"This was not the political component."
He gets into his all-terrain car, circling his vast 20-hectare empire.
He did law studies that he dropped out of, and later went on to study biology before becoming interested in computer science and eventually becoming a career leader.
And a lover of stones.
It stores 40,000 tons.
He is collecting treasures all over Germany.
He claims to be the greatest merchant of ancient stones.
He's choking.
Sandstones carved with art are laid on the snow.
"In the past, they were part of the Marienbrücke bridge in Dresden".
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, he says enthusiastically.
"My favorite stone."
It takes the path that goes up through the forest.
He shows a pile of his finger: red sandstone, previously part of Karlsruhe train station.
And so on.
"Joli travertine."
The parallelepiped was once part of the grandstand of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow of stones and stories, the Cannstatt travertine from the police prefecture, the reddish granite from the St. Blasian cathedral, the tuff from the Heilbronn hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thinks that the stones were once carved by hand and moved with the help of simple batons and carts pulled by oxen, he becomes quite respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a heritage was put to pieces."
He did not become rich, let alone rich.
But this carrier now employs 14 people. In addition, stone carvers, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassblower and a gardener have settled in the forest.
“We’re working hard, but it’s rewarding,” says the waste recycler.
Soon, he will have to go to Cologne.
There are also some rocks to be saved.
Talent Struggle to Conquer High Potentials
The counter has a strong influence.
16 students scramble to buy salmon rolls, tomato sauce and egg whites.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited students in design and mechanical engineering to a workshop.
As part of some kind of idea contest, they have to talk business about the car of the future with the designers of VW, and, by the way, know the Volkswagen company.
Nowadays, many companies do not hesitate to go face-to-face in the competition to find better brains and engage, like Volkswagen, in a multifaceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: Recruit the most talented graduates in amphitheaters as much as possible before they arrive in the job market and are courted by others.
And since universities do not publish statements about the performance of their students, we try to identify outstanding talents in practical projects and to keep them loyal.
On the second day of the workshop organized at the Technical University of Brauschweig the automotive group softens the talents.
A young lady from the staff service shares the pens, candy and cards with the Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the schedule of professional internships and student jobs for young talents; she shows them the ways to access the group's premises.
Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig is responsible for the project with Volkswagen.
For him, there are mutual benefits for both parties: "Students come into contact with this industrial sector and gain experience."
"As for the Volkswagen Group, he can get to know the students, take a closer look at the serious candidates and appreciate those who come in line as a collaborator."
According to Mr. sadle, such cooperation is unusual.
What is new is the offensive with which we seek to attract students.
"In the past, the focus was more on the professional project," says Mr Selle.
The struggle for the conquest of new graduates will become much fiercer.
In property sectors, companies can no longer recruit their employees by sorting a list of candidates.
But they must brag about their reliability and above all court the highly skilled workforce.
It is mainly graduates from the engineering fields who are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the VDI German Engineers Association, more than 40,000 engineering positions remained vacant in October.
And according to the forecasts of the VDI, the gap relating to engineering positions will increase even more.
Roman Dykta goes on a talent hunt on behalf of KPMG, an audit firm, accounting expert and advisory firm.
It organizes expensive talent recruitment events, such as the KPMG-Race cruise race, a kind of paper rally where competitors have to find their way using GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year to travel this way through the United States.
Participants can visit KPMG subsidiaries and get to know the company.
The person who is to participate in it decides in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream of the cream of the many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Dykta, the means used for the quest for high potentials in universities are increasingly important.
"We want to emerge from the lot thanks to the cruise race."
"For us, a simple cruise was too little"
For the talent hunter Mr. Dykta, the count seems to be there.
"Until today, we have remained in touch with all the people who took part in a similar action last year."
"Some of them are about to complete their studies and want to send their applications to our company soon," he says.
Apart from the direct softening done on campus, small and medium-sized enterprises are quite classic in participating in trade fairs where they engage in brain-hunting.
"We try to reach graduates by participating in trade shows."
“For example, at the solar technology show,” says Sitha Stübe, Human Resources Director at Solarworld, a photovoltaic panel manufacturer.
This company based in Bonn employs about 1500 people in Germany.
Ms. Stübe was aware of the issue of succession.
Currently, 35 positions are put to the contest on the company's website.
“It’s very difficult to fill vacancies right now.”
“It’s expensive and takes a lot of time,” he says.
Another way to make contact is through university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various higher education institutions, for example, the University of Fribourg.
"Teachers indicate that the student has the opportunity to undertake professional internships or to write his/her final project in our home."
Expensive advertising campaigns are being advertised among solar specialists.
This is why the company tries to advertise by highlighting other qualities: personalized atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
“Often, a large group can’t do that,” says Ms. Stübe, chief of staff.
Money has long ceased to play a major role in job search.
Other determinants are flexible working hours, childcare or good promotion opportunities.
According to a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranks 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The institute is an annual honorarium of German employers.
To this end, he questions employees about their level of satisfaction with their work and its context while looking at the employee’s framework conditions.
The Chief of Staff Ms. Stübe hopes that this placement will enhance the company's image among jobseekers.
“I think candidates rely mostly on external assessments regarding a potential employer,” she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding Academy (DEBA) advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr. Kriegler, this means first of all taking internal measures.
“The best way for an employer to become attractive is to go through their own employees,” he says.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, i.e. the creation of the employer's brand image within its own workforce.
"satisfied employees form the best messengers."
When you treat your employees well and they identify with the company, they advertise their employer to their friends and acquaintances on their own.
“It’s like playing in an orchestra,” says Mr. Kriegler.
Obama puts a brake on new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, southeastern United States, in the coming years.
The Washington government has issued a ban an equivalent ban and thus definitively overturned its initial plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains currently prohibited.
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar made the announcement on Wednesday.
The explosion of the "Deepwater Horizon" drilling rig in April is the reason for this strict ban, which must remain in force for at least the next five years.
In the face of this accident, which killed 11 employees and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and this sector of activity, said he was willing to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Proponents of this solution want to reduce the dependence of the United States on foreign countries in terms of oil supply.
The question of who is responsible for the devastating black tide in golf has not, to date, been definitively resolved.
The British oil group, which faces multi-billion-dollar claims, is at the centre of the accusations.
A commission of inquiry set up by Obama is due to present its findings in December.
In October, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar lifted the freeze on drilling after the platform exploded.
As a result of this decision, various oil groups had immediately submitted requests for new drilling projects.
With stricter controls and stricter security orders, Obama and Salazar want to prevent another catastrophe.
The competent supervisory authority, which has been discredited after numerous allegations of corruption, is currently undergoing thorough reforms.
At the same time, Obama announced that he would remove them from the lucrative tax niches of gas and oil groups.
Actors in this sector are now publicly warning against the fact that the flow of power in the Gulf would be significantly lower than it has been so far.
"The government's goal is to put a brake on the rapid growth of the gas and oil sector," according to a current survey conducted in the sector by the audit firm BDO, ahead of Wednesday's drilling ban.
Moreover, the American Enery Alliance deplores the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "No one knows what exactly will change with regulation."
Investments in new support projects have been shifted to a new order, to the detriment of growth.
Ogoni country is dry
The water flowing in the rivers is oiled brown; it emits a smell similar to that existing in the gas station: Due to a leak, billions of liters of crude oil have destroyed the Ogoni country in Nigeria.
Men live from theft, corruption and refining of oil.
Celestine Akpobari has good intentions.
“Don’t get tired,” the environmental activist told reporters to calm them down: “You still have enough oil sludge in front of the water lens today.”
The 37-year-old Nigerian tried to photograph a young man plunged into muddy water to the chest, as well as the greasy trail that surrounds him: This scene looks almost beautiful in the glow of water in the color of the rainbow.
It cannot be seen that the basement is full of brown crude oil sheets.
On the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom relates that she once collected shrimp by whole buckets here.
But in the meantime, the calm waters are completely dry.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil came out of an oil pipeline that exploded in the huge swamp.
Fishermen living in the small town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to reach the fishy waters: The Ogoni country located in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The full extent of the devastation comes to mind when one walks through the mangrove swamps crossed by streams.
Instead of clear water, the motorboat splits a crackling brown water, and whoever dips his hand in it removes it from any oil.
The roots of small mangroves emerge from the ground like licorice sticks. Isolated palms sadly let their palms hang.
We search in vain for the clouds of birds, as we usually find them in wet areas: From the moment the outboard engine stops, a ghostly silence descends on this paradise of old that resembles a gas station by the smell it emits.
“What is happening here is war on the environment,” says Mr. Celestine Akpobari in a sad voice: “Our life is characterized by a permanent danger to health.”
The comparison of wars is made.
The region where the Ogoni live is a battlefield besieged for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first European explorers entered here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. This was executed later. This region became very dangerous. In 1993, the Shell group had to stop working for production.
While more than 2 million barrels of black gold are pumped daily thanks to more than 5,000 wells and 7,000 kilometers of oil pipelines in the entire Delta region, three times as large as Switzerland, the oil fields of the Ogoni country are unexploited, because the situation is unexploitable.
Every few hundred meters stand in the water of steel braids like strange sculptures: It is very affectionately referred to as "Christmas trees" the heads of drill holes.
They are up to 50 years old, most are gnawed by corrosion to the mark.
Akpobari believes that a drilling head of this nature breaks down from time to time, as a constant flow of crude oil flows into the water.
Experts estimate that more than two billion litres have spilled onto the ecosystem in 50 years: Each year, the amount of oil equivalent to that spilled into the sea in the crash of the super-petroleum plant "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago off the Alaskan coast, one of the largest disasters in the world.
Who should be responsible for persistent environmental pollution? the answer to this question divides the actors.
For the Shell Group, the sabotage and siphoning of pipelines is responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, and environmentalists consider drillhead explosions and drilled pipelines to be the main causes.
In 2008, U.S. researcher Richard Steiner blamed the Shell group for applying substantially less stringent safety standards in Nigeria than anywhere else in the world: Only the rate of pipe failures is “yet much higher than allure”.
Some forms emerge from mangroves in a place that, seen from afar, looks like an abandoned workshop, full of camels and installed in the open air: They are completely naked and covered with camels to the neck.
A sparkling fire under one of the many barrels that sometimes connected to the pipes, sometimes scattered without a pattern on the site must be found: a small clandestine refinery.
The crude oil is heated in the barrel for several hours, says Michael, the team leader.
First, gasoline enters a container through pipes, then at the end of the pipe the kerosene drops fall and finally diesel is obtained.
This is how Michael and his four collaborators produce four 300-litre diesel barrels a day: “That brings us 34,000 Naira,” about $22.
Delta residents are taking advantage of chronic fuel shortages in the largest oil-producing country in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a lower price than the ridiculously low price of just 40 cents per litre of Diesel: Because they buy their raw material for free.
This is offered by the "protectors" who are drilling the oil pipeline network throughout the Ogoni country. According to experts, the country loses at least 16 million liters of crude oil throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a very small part of the raw material temporarily stored is illegally purified: the networks of organized crime, which also include high-ranking politicians and military members, load the lion’s share into tankers and snatch it into the world market.
Activist Akpobari believes that the debate about whether to attribute environmental disaster or rather subversive activities to the population or lax mode of production is purely academic.
“If the oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if the foundations of the fishermen’s life were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, no theft and illegal refineries.”
But, meanwhile, the Ogoni’s relationship with Shell has deteriorated so much that there was no question of the group’s withdrawal. “perhaps operators with other nationalities, such as the Chinese, will prove better.”
Michael is getting nervous.
“It’s high time you got off the hook,” announces the robust oil worker.
"Soldiers can appear at any time."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not be arrested, but at most they will offer them bribes.
Even soldiers, especially from the north of the country, want to take advantage of the raw material like all Nigerians do.
“From every point of view, this shitty thing has brought our country down very low,” regrets Akpori.
Investigators discover construction defects in A380 reactors
The A380 clearly suffers from a major safety problem.
Examining a device that made an emergency landing, investigators discovered a possible construction defect that could lead to “catastrophic reactor failure.”
The airline Qantas now wants to file a complaint against the manufacturer of the reactor.
In early November, Airbus passengers belonging to the company Quantas were visibly more fortunate so far: In the course of its investigation, the Australian aviation safety authority found that the reactors of some A380 aircraft had a serious safety problem, and it warns against a possible construction defect.
This potential failure could lead to serious consequences: It can cause fatigue coves and leaks at the oil pipeline connection, according to a statement released Thursday by the ATSB administration.
It could have led to a “catastrophic reactor failure.”
This concerns the Rolls-Royce-built reactors equipped with 20 A380-series aircraft.
The Airbus of the company Quantas, which had to land urgently on November 4 in Singapore, is among them.
The Australian airline has now launched legal proceedings against the British manufacturer of reactors.
She filed a legal complaint with an Australian federal court based in Sydney, which gives her the opportunity to take further legal action against the company.
Quantas director Alan Joyce said his company would claim damages in connection with the incident in early November.
Parts were detached and the bearing surface was damaged during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, oil ignition is the cause of the damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced in the world.
Australian investigators have announced that further safety tests will be carried out on the superjumbos that are also equipped with the reactors in question.
The safety recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, ASTB spokesman Martin Dolan said.
The security issue is considered to be sufficiently important to inform all parties concerned.
After the emergency landing of his plane, the airline Quantas had grounded its entire A380 fleet for a week.
Singapore Airlines has temporarily shut down three of its 11 A380s.
As a precautionary measure, Lufthansa has replaced the reactor of an A380.
The two-story aircraft is the largest airliner in the world.
Snowfall across the country is causing chaos in transport
Germany all covered in white: In one night, the snow fell on almost the whole country.
Chaos reigns on all roads, trains and planes are immobilized.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter is raging in Germany: With frigid temperatures, almost the entire republic is covered in snow on Thursday night, leading to chaos in many localities.
In the north and east, snow cover reaches 15 centimeters in places.
Traffic is severely restricted on several motorways and on many roads.
On the national A7 in Flensburg, winter service staff worked on a permanent basis, but they were unable to overcome the snow that was accumulating.
In addition, violent storms swept the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) expects tidal surges to occur along the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels up to 1.2 m above normal.
Snowfall on highways and federal roads has caused serious problems in Saxony.
That's why the Meteomedia bad weather alert station announced the purple alert level was announced in Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it's the highest level.
In some places, 30 centimeters of fresh snow fell, which the strong and cool winds dispersed.
Several trucks and cars were stuck there at night.
Even in Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities have reported serious disturbances on the roads.
On the A2 motorway, snow and wind caused a traffic interruption and caused traffic jams.
In Thuringia, snowfalls hit the A4 and A9 motorways.
According to Deutsche Bahn, serious disruptions to rail traffic have occurred in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are: snow on the railways, fallen trees on the railways, catenaries or destroyed needles.
In Saxony, interregional transport between Leipzig and Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In Sallfeld, Thuringia, an ICE train to Munich had to interrupt its journey.
Firefighters and paramedics had to supply the 165 passengers of the train with blankets, food and drinks.
Snowstorms swept the roads.
Snowfall has led to numerous flight cancellations at major airports in Germany.
According to a spokesman for the standard and information about the flights, some cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A Fraport spokesman says 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt on the Main.
The winter service ensures a permanent service.
It is true that passengers stuck at the airport are no longer numerous, despite this, only 400 beds are available there.
Accidents occurred on Wednesday afternoon on many roads.
In the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life in a collision with a train at a level crossing.
The driver of the train was slightly injured.
Due to the snow layers present on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was caught at a level crossing because the vehicle was immobilized there.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured in the train, which is why the road from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car blew up on a slippery road in Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists announce a good news: The snow will certainly always be soft and dusty, but it will swirl in case of slight squalls.
But the wind is going to weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be afflicted by violent and rapid winds.
However, it is very cold, up to less than 15 degrees per place.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers.
The Deutsche Bank seeks to separate itself from its emblem: According to newspaper reports, this financial institution is looking for buyers for its two office buildings located at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
This building could yield up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just graced the Group’s headquarters: The twin towers located in the Business District have been modernised; in the meantime, the bankers have had to return to their former place of service.
From now on, the financial group clearly seeks to recover the costs of renovations and it is looking for a buyer for its two buildings, as the newspaper "Financial Times Deutschland", citing a spokesman.
The spokesperson did not specify the reasons for the planned sale.
He said: “We are checking whether it is more interesting to occupy the buildings ourselves or to sell them, and to put them back for rent at a later date.”
This is how Germany’s largest financial institution has already relinquished its seat, shortly after.
It was not until mid-2007 that the bank acquired the twin towers for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>272 million from equity holders and then rehabilitated them.
Energy-optimization transformations have reportedly engulfed around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million.
A sale would obviously bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, experts in this industry estimate the value of the towers, in the meantime renamed "Green Towers", at about 500 million euros.
According to the spokesman, it is currently not known whether the buildings will be sold again to a fund owned by the bank or an independent investor.
Thousands of people mourn the deaths of minors.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people had a thought for buried miners who were declared dead as a result of several explosions in a mine.
The bodies had not yet been recovered because the safety situation of the damaged well continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred at Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 minors between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried underground.
A probe had been introduced into the damaged well, but no trace of survivors had been found.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other explosions that followed, no rescue team was able to get down to the mine for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration had considered that the minors had no chance of surviving.
Until now, the bodies could not be raised.
Today, relatives and friends have organized a celebration in memory of the dead.
Thousands of people had gathered under a blazing sun in Greymouth, south of New Zealand.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 buried miners, 29 tables were installed on which the names, helmets and lamps could be seen.
Photos and personal effects, including clothing and surfboards, also had their place there.
The flags were displayed in front of all public buildings in the country.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told participants at the commemorative party that New Zealand had nurtured hopes that the miners would come back to the surface.
"But they never came home."
Mr. Lawrie Drew, whose Zen son was buried in the trenches, said he cannot resign to accepting his son's death until he has seen his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the parents of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative celebration.
Miners of South African and British origin were also buried during the first explosion on 19 November.
Rescuers have begun extinguishing a fire inside New Zealand's South Island coal mine.
Police prefect Gary Knowles told reporters that when the masses of explosive gases are moved, burning temperatures inside the mine begin to drop.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is the Splatter film an artificial film?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the limits of the ancient genre through his film, "Walhalla Rising", the fighter's epic.
What audience did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when filming "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) with only one eye is taken prisoner; he frees himself from his executioner and, with an almost supernatural force, eliminates his opponents one after the other. This seems ideal for young male spectators looking for a bloody action, just because our hero's method is bad.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the borgne does not say a word about his real name. Even the other characters escape, at most, around one or two sentences a few terrible cries of agony.
Otherwise, we say nothing and we celebrate in the incredibly beautiful mountainous landscape of Scotland, which is the setting of the Viking universe, about a thousand years ago.
It would be ideal more mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and for excellent travelings.
When a film targets multiple target groups, it is a pity that they mutually exclude each other.
Director Winding Refn has been seen, since the release of "Pusher", as a kind of Danish Quentin Tarantino, but he refuses to bring a little more mood to mainstream or introduce a little less brutality to art and rehearsal cinema.
Most art film sympathizers have to experience the horror of the brain that spreads all around and the intestines.
Lovers of action films die of boredom when the barge embarks, for reasons that can be freely interpreted, with a group of violent Christian missionaries on a ship bound for Jerusalem; they are drowned for an eternity by calm and fog before the crew continues to arrive in America.
It is not surprising then that "Walhalla Rising" did not find any film distributors in Germany and that it exists only in DVD format.
It is mainly because of the magnificent images of misery that deserved some attention, but also because the image of a thrilling film, from time to time, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
It is not a dialogue in this film, nor a coherent action, everything is ambience, a feverish dream transformed into film.
The spectator cannot escape.
Refn barely gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly cuts his throat with glacial images and a grim soundtrack, but above all with an elusive hatred that springs from the hearts of the characters.
Only a young blonde boy, who stands faithfully by the side of the bartender, preserves a certain innocence, all the others are animated by anger.
More than anything else, the barren hero whose motives are never known, but who returns from hell at any time to fight enemies and provisionally allies by transforming himself into a warrior, is perhaps sent by the devil himself.
It represents rotting, but perhaps also, only for those who are, anyway, rotten.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that can be hated or admired, which aims at aggravation, enthusiasm and astonishment.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new information on a nuclear program developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a position on this issue, let alone submit to the agency's controls.
On the night of September 5-6, 2007, around midnight, at least four Israeli F-15 fighter jets attacked a mysterious cubic-shaped building on Syrian territory.
It is located on the bank of the Euphrates; the largest city located nearby is 30 kilometers: it is Dair as-Sur.
Its name appears in IAEA documents, because it is about the reactor that Syria has built, it appears with the help of North Korea in parallelepiped of stone, hidden in a valley marked by the absence of electricity.
According to a U.S. intelligence briefing from late April 2008, the current reactor, known as the neighboring town of el-Kibar, would be well suited to produce plutonium, which would allow nuclear weapons to be manufactured.
On the other hand, this technique has been valid since the 1950s.
The CIA showed a presentation video featuring blurry satellite images.
Through computer-aided animation, it indicated the probable location of each reactor component before the destruction of the plant which represents a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she presented the photos showing the building located nearby, or even the interior of it.
It appears that the reactor was about to be put into operation, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, little more information is available than at the time, and even, with time, the mystery thickens more and more.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that prior to this attack, the CIA was certainly sure that Syria had built a reactor at el-Kibar, but had little evidence showing that the country was developing “an active nuclear weapons program.”
Some intelligence agents in Europe prefer to be more cautious about this and speak only of a “presumed reactor,” even if they consider the CIA’s presentation as “plausible.”
They lack tangible evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asked how he ensures he is dealing with a nuclear reactor, a senior UN diplomat gave only a laconic response in the summer, saying the IAEA had “sufficient documents to ask questions.”
The Syrians certainly hastily removed the debris from the "unused military building" and proceeded to a methodical flattening of the ground.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen discovered traces of man-made uranium in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA has received satellite images from commercial providers from a member state showing the moment that followed the attack directly; it appears that the latter are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, perhaps Israel, has acquired them exclusively.
As a result, it is impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always assured that it has never carried out a secret atomic program and that it has not built a reactor.
Damascus claims that the uranium found on the site comes from weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA rejected this argument after analyzing the particles, calling it improbable.
Since then, damas has refused any discussion about it, as well as about satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow the controllers to carry out a second inspection on the site of el-Kibar and refused access to the debris of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel keeps a stubborn silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister in office at the time of the attack, recently said: "We will never comment on this."
For example, the investigation into this case has been dragging on since June 2008 without a result being achieved and it is "turning increasingly into a serious problem of the Agency's credibility", as a senior Western diplomat in service at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna acknowledges, ultimately it is a serious violation of the treaty of prohibition.
The IAEA considers that to make progress, it is necessary to clarify the existence of the other three facilities that must have "a functional relationship" with the alleged reactor.
So far, the inspectors have neither indicated which facilities are in question here, nor what their function is or what they are suspected of containing.
According to information published by the newspaper "Süddeutsche Zeitung", they are known within the IAEA respectively under the names of Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah also by the names of neighboring cities.
Washington’s Independent Institute for Science and International Security has identified these locations and discovered on satellite images a complex near Masyaf that would most likely be one of the suspect objects.
It is possible that it is located in a military base or directly next to it; that is exactly why Syria refuses access to the three sites to the IAEA inspectors.
In Vienna, it is claimed that Syrians fear that the inspection group is in fact spies who would be sent on behalf of the United States by the IAEA to spy on military installations.
In fact, it is intelligence provided by U.S. Secret Agents that has attracted the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have made shuttles between the three sites and the stone parallelepiped in order to transport substances.
A senior Western diplomat said in Vienna that at least one of the facilities could be "used to produce fuel."
It would have "no indications of sensitive activities", such as enrichment and reprocessing of uranium; processes that are indispensable to the production of nuclear weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works thanks to unenriched uranium.
Nevertheless, there are plausible assumptions regarding the following fundamental questions: where uranium should have come from and where plutonium would have been separated later.
It is unknown whether the scraps, which could hide high-value traces, were stored in the three sites.
When the hundreds of land-loaded trucks have disappeared, no one will have information on the location of the rubble.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria had the al-Tibni salt mine, located just a few kilometers from el-Kibar, across the Euphrates, examined in 1998 to see if it could be suitable for the storage of radioactive waste.
By analysing recently satellite photos taken on behalf of the famous magazine Jane's Intelligence Review, former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley has established a link between these and the reactor in question.
Satellite images show, however, that Syria undertook groundwork at the three suspected sites and moved huge containers when the IAEA began demanding access to those sites.
It may be a coincidence, but it did not help to rule out suspicions.
It is said in the diplomatic circles that the IAEA spent several months developing a plan regarding the inspections to be carried out there. This plan was to allow Syria to preserve any military secrets. Only the time invested shows how much interest the inspectors bring to this matter.
In the meantime, Damascus has also rejected this proposal.
A year ago, if Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the urgency would not have been signaled for this case, says, for example, Glyn Davies, the U.S. ambassador who has been evoking for a few months what is known as special inspections, one of the most powerful means of nuclear control.
The Director of the IAEA, Mr. Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future", but he is still hesitant.
This means a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors and a good number of the 35 countries represented there have no desire to see the situation escalate.
On the other hand, like this diplomat who gives to reflect: "That would be useful, if in the end they find nothing"
Love in times of war
It's been a long time since Angelina Jolie made her directorial debut this summer.
She wrote the script herself: it is a love story between a woman of Bosnian origin and a man of Serbian origin.
Nothing else is known about this story, but it is enough to cause discomfort.
A persistent rumor indicates that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian executioner during the Yugoslav war.
The Bosnian women's federations immediately protested, and in response, some of the filming planned in Sarajevo was moved to Hungary at the last minute.
Meanwhile, the film is shot in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, the protests continue in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the Women Victims of War organization sent a correspondence to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and she demanded to meet with the actress.
She is not a diplomat, and a few weeks ago she proposed to these women to meet with them in Hungary, but they declined that offer.
"The meeting must be held in Bosnia," Hasecic said.
There have been no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie's script says quite a lot about her attitude towards the victims.
The Guardian reports that Hasecic's organization subsequently recommended to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees that Angelina Jolie be removed from her position as Goodwill Ambassador.
But by the way, what kind of script did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of its script, granted a filming permit in Sarajevo after a few hesitations, but it is not known why it did not come later despite this authorization.
The young author herself assures that she does not pursue political objectives with her film, that it was through great efforts that she became aware of the Yugoslav conflict, and she argues that she wants to highlight the terrible consequences of the war and give all stakeholders the opportunity to express themselves.
However, it remains vague about the content.
This is how a second synopsis of the film circulates on the Net. It is quite different: The lovers knew each other well before the start of the war. It meets again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guard.
This is a big difference with the version "a rape victim falls in love with his executioner".
That Jolie's film started well before the war, of course.
The pressure exerted on her, Jolie says, is "unfair and based on misinformation".
From now on, only Hollywood fanatics can bring him peace: by illegally putting this scenario on the Net, like many others before.
Let's go!
All is well with the Irish again tonight.
There is no sign of consternation.
This is why the local team over-dominates visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans shout with joy against the background of loud music, they stab their feet.
Baileyu-Pub from Cork in southern Ireland vibrates because players throw and manage to drop table tennis balls at a distance of three meters into the opposing team's beer cups.
This bizarre show is called "beer-pong", the winner earns 500 Euros plus a plane ticket allowing him to attend the beer-pong world championship in January in Las Vegas.
Cian Tanner is a calm individual; this subtle drinking game and the computer scientist reserved, these two behaviors really don’t go well together.
And yet, despite this, the 26-year-old seeks to have fun, to turn away from the terrifying question, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not included in his plans. In January, he will lead hiring interviews in New Zealand.
“I have a strange feeling,” he says.
"The homeland is so far away and I don't have a job."
Finally: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland, "in less than two, she got her desired job as an event project manager, maybe a good sign," says the young man smiling.
Due to the dark prospects in the country, two of Tanner's three sisters tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, lives in Sydney, and his brother Colin now holds a computer consulting position in London.
Young people leave: The situation of most families living on the island resembles that of the tanners.
Experts from the Institute for Economic and Social Research indicate that 100,000 Irish people will soon leave their country.
They even expect a number of 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million people.
If these predictions are realized, it will be an emigration trend comparable to that which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom during which the Irish enjoyed great ease, grief now takes over.
The economic crisis, however, mainly affects the well-trained young Irish, who have so far only experienced moments of happiness.
The loss of employment and social decay seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there is excess money.
In the meantime, three out of ten people under the age of 30 are unemployed.
The Irish Times publishes extensively the letters of readers written by young emigrants, who complain: "In Ireland, everything goes wrong."
“There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but whoever has the opportunity is leaving and our country is leaving for a generation.”
"The last one to leave turns off the light."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees a darker future as the government is only throwing dust at the eyes and offering no future prospects for young people.
“They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs,” says the 20-year-old student.
She sees her comrades cramping from one unpaid practical internship to another.
She says her biggest concern is to emigrate herself in four years.
"It's a sad and depressing thought."
However men like Stephen McLarnon try to approach this topic positively.
McLarnon organizes the exhibition "WorkingAbroadExpo" which offers full support on the theme "working abroad".
"But working abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for newcomers to take the first steps in the professional hierarchy," he said.
Its website shows photos of surfers in Australia and snow surfers in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a mess, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For the past six months, Se<0xC3><0xA1>n O'Donovan has known what it means to be based elsewhere.
As there was nothing to do in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector in Germany.
A fashion house in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other projects in Hanover or Berlin.
Meanwhile, O'Donovan rarely visits his home country, as he participates in an additional job, in order to be able to complete the repayment of the loan contracted to build his home in his home country.
"The situation is already a little crazy," he says, crossing the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
“I make money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I hardly live anymore.”
He bursts out with an embarrassed laugh as he walked through the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-kept front gardens, expensive cars of major brands are parked on the access roads.
Four years ago, O’Donovan bought the house together with his sister for an amount of 380,000 Euros, financed 100 percent by the credit.
“These were moments of madness, no doubt, money was easy,” he says.
Is he afraid to see everything collapse because of credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, sips hot tea and says, "I don't have kids to entertain and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can go back to zero."
The building engineer doesn't like the lamentations he's often heard lately.
“No one should suffer from hunger, our situation is still not as dramatic as what we once experienced here on the island,” he said.
“Working abroad for a while isn’t the worst thing that can happen, maybe it’s what makes us feel Irish at first.
He laughs and then talks about his father who went to England during the last major economic crisis.
“He was back after seven years and in Ireland, life was just going on.”
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Leaving the future and discovering how life is happening elsewhere.
In his palmares, he already has a few years of work in London, which is why life in New Zealand should not be so easy for him and his girlfriend.
But there is still one thing that worries him in recent days: the party to be held on the occasion of his 27th birthday in Dublin.
He fears that she might turn into a farewell party.
“Just not a lot of emotions,” he said while drinking a long sip of beer.
"A farewell, it still seems troubling."
"Let's call it a good-bye night, all relaxed, gathering a few friends, with a few drinks and a few games."
The democratic routine.
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as does support for private enterprise.
Crime has become a greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latinobar<0xC3><0xB3>metro survey in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted on a regular basis since 1995, it follows changes in attitudes in the region.
Two related elements emerge from the results of this year's survey, conducted in September and early October.
The first is the rather sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries around the South American Pacific (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has risen from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy recovered after experiencing a sharp decline in production last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, lowering the regional average (see Table 2).
Some 44% of respondents in the region said they were satisfied with the way their country's democracy worked in practice; this was the same as last year but with a sharp increase from 25% in 2001 (Figure 3)
Some 34 per cent said they had confidence in their country's parliament and 45 per cent in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but a sharp increase compared to 2003 (17 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively).
Ten years ago, economic problems in Latin America rocked support for democracy.
While this has been good during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many countries in America have experienced only a brief recession and have benefited from a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network has helped protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and fell again this year to 32%.)
But the mood varies considerably from country to country (see Chart 4).
Brazil’s good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz In<0xC3><0xA1>cio Lula da Silva, translates into a widely shared sense of progress
This is rarer in Mexico and Central America where the recession has been more severe and violent crimes have aggravated.
This is only the second time since the survey began that more respondents across Latin America as a whole have cited crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their country (see Table 5).
About 31 per cent say they or one of their loved ones have been the victim of a criminal act in the past year; however, this figure is down from 38 per cent last year and is the lowest since 1995.
More robust economic performance is reflected in increased support for private enterprise and the market economy: about 71% of respondents in the region say private enterprise is indispensable for development, compared with 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their country developed, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela are of this opinion (and 80% support private enterprise); although their left-wing president, Hugo Chavez, expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is the largest leader in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, down 11% from last year).
But the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A dirty vote
No one expected a perfect general election in Haiti on November 28.
But it was far worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the country ravaged and plunged into fear.
Voting boxes and re-election were presented, ballot papers scattered in the gutters, sacked polling stations and intimidation
The polling stations opened late in the evening.
Many Haitians, including many who were displaced following the January earthquake, wandered around the neighborhood to find where to vote.
Some of them ended up giving up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several alleged favorites, denounced the fraud and called for the cancellation of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, have exploded across the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the United Nations’ senior official in Haiti, considers the event to be “a pretty good election in many respects.”
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously stated that they "did not believe that these irregularities, however serious, necessarily invalidated the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are indebted to René Préval, the outgoing unpopular president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, is due to announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The second round is scheduled for January.
All hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew from their initial call for the vote to be declared void.
But there may be problems if Mr. Célestin, who has little or no noticeable support among voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second round reached the second round.
With a cholera epidemic raging, and more than 1 million earthquake survivors still living in tents, there were fears of participation.
In this case, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from voting because of the disorganization.
Nearly 250,000 identity cards needed to vote were not yet issued shortly before the election.
The stakes are important.
Donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an important step in Haiti’s reconstruction.
And so, it is clear, the Haitians do it themselves.
The tip of the feet towards the center
In the weeks after she suddenly became a widow, Cristina Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, President of Argentina, benefited from a wave of public sympathy that improved her approval rate from 20 points to more than 50%; this is her highest level since she was elected in 2007.
However, turning this into a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year could depend on Ms Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez’s choice, visibly in mourning, whether or not she would abandon the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And in this regard, the signs remain confused.
Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, was used to developing budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend the extra income at will.
Ms. Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez's government lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has plummeted in disarray following Mr. Kirchner's death from a heart attack on October 27.
Some of the dissident members of the Peronist movement in power joined with Ms. Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez.
But after chaotic sessions (where a parliamentarian slammed one of his peers in the face and others accused the government of corruption), Congress doesn’t have to approve the 2011 budget.
“I’m not going to argue,” the president said.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the president even more room for manoeuvre to spend at will.
The economy is largely overheating: it is likely to grow by nearly 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is now at 11.1% but many private estimates and wage demands from trade unions see this figure close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction a priority, rather than controlling inflation.
He refused to deal with the IMF, harassed the private sector and cleared the INDEC, the statistical office, which falsified official inflation statistics.
Can Ms. Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez now moderate these policies?
She called for talks between private companies and union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit wage increases next year to 18%.
The economy was stimulated by high world prices of agricultural exports from Argentina.
But inflation eroded the growth boost following a strong devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Ms Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez shows signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial relations with the rest of the world.
This year, the government entered into an agreement with bondholders who had refused a previous forced debt restructuring for which Argentina had not settled its dues in 2001.
Now Ms. Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez seems to be edging towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this could not involve oversight by the IMF, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund would provide “technical assistance” to design a new national consumer price index; which resembles a prelude to INDEC’s sanitation.
It is not clear whether Ms. Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez wants to remain in politics beyond the end of her term, now that her husband is no longer by her side.
If she does, she needs to win the support of the middle class, among which Kirchnerism is highly advocated.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have refluxed.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether or not to repudiate many of her husband’s policies without noise.
A Half-Hour for China
Taiwanese voters have oriented themselves towards a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother on the other side of the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters turned out on November 27, 70% of eligible people, to elect mayors and municipal councilors in five urban districts, as part of what is considered a general assessment of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become a substitute for sentiment towards the continent, having established innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, in the largest reorganization of relations with China proper since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but just now.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) won three out of five mayors, it failed to win a majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which leaned toward Taiwan’s full independence, won nearly 50% of all votes for the 45% KMT.
If it had been a presidential election, Mr. Ma would have been in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party’s voting share has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP has attracted voters, even with the KMT in municipal councils.
The event unveiled most of the main themes of the Taiwanese elections, including tapered country trucks and mass gathering flags with girls dancing in minimal attire.
A mandatory mysterious assassination attempt was also carried out.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT, conducted an election tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man from the crowd shot the young Mr. Lien, purely through the face, wounding him and killing a passerby.
Oddly enough, it was not determined whether the shooter wanted to hurt Mr. Link or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Anyway, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, the murder had consequences on the election by directing suspicion on the DPP and turning voters towards the KMT.
Perhaps the biggest winner of the election was China.
It was striking to see how much the question of the continental part itself was absent.
Instead, the candidates played with plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China’s military threat.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid bridging its ties with the Beijing government.
But this time, the DPP also abstained from inciting anti-Chinese sentiment.
This is the response to a new awareness that Chinese companies are indispensable to Taiwan’s economic survival.
Ma, for his part, claimed confirmation of whether his China policy was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
It can be expected that the Beijing Government will continue to provide trade facilities, in line with its strategy to lure Taiwan back to the cradle.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to organize a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, she would also like to see political integration; but let’s start from the beginning.
It is better to wait for this after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has reinvented itself anyway.
Two years ago, his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on corruption charges.
President from 2000 to 2008, he was a provocateur in favor of explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates has emerged under Ms. Tsai’s leadership and the PDP is working hard to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was hailed as a DPP candidate for the presidency, such as Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that he too can engage with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their interviews can take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai told the Taiwanese public that her party presented a "trustworthy alternative" to Mr. Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems infuriated by this change.
In a statement released from his cell, he said that PDP candidates would have achieved better results if they had insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
Even without Chen’s intervention, the DPP will have a hard time choosing between its potential candidates.
The KMT needs to do an introspection of itself.
Mr. Ma's assessments were weak; despite stupendous economic growth, KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its unpopularity appears to be largely due to unemployment and the widening gap between the rich and the poor.
A spokesman for the KMT said its office and local offices will be redesigned.
The good results of the PDP suggest that Taiwan's support for rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent editorialist, "the point of no return has already passed."
Grammy Award Nominations: Jazz Singer Esperanza Spalding Is a Surprise Selected in the "Best New Artist" Category
Perform at the request of a president, and people are required to take note of it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer handpicked by President Obama to perform at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, marked one of the Grammy Awards’ surprises this year with a large-scale nomination in the “Best New Artist” category.
Considering that Spalding is a well-known figure on the jazz scene since his 2008 album, "Esperanza", the nomination remains somewhat mysterious but it is consistent with the Grammy Awards rules that an artist should not release more than three albums before recording; this "establishes the public identity of this artist."
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", certainly marked a step forward and, given his slightly engaging vocal style, his skillful hand of pop and funk and his Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least a dotted line at Spalding in relation to the lightning success of Norah Jones's last year's category in 2003, the closest equivalent of these productions ever to the electors.
Elsewhere, Grammy Awards voters have rightly honoured Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity" in the "instrumental album" category, a glimpse of a revitalizing thrill of a recording that was one of the top favorites last year.
Among these Iyer, "Moody 4B" by veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboardist John Beasley will be in competition.
Trombone Shorty, a New Orleans favorite and frequent guest on HBO's "Treme", was honored in the contemporary jazz category; which also leans strongly towards a certain fusion with the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The Secret Society of the savage Darcy James Argue, familiar with steampunk, has won some well-deserved accolades in the big ensemble category; in competition with the rich chamber-jazz of Billy Childs Ensemble and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose album "Pathways" from his octet's live bassist was a fine example of this hand-in-hand décratique.
Grammy Awards Nomination: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey Lead in Classic Categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards feature a mix of landscapes of musicians and composers from around the world.
At the top of the nominations are Michael Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra, with five "yes"; and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an electric orchestral work, with three "yes".
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California is Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a work that was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman’s Madolin Concerto is also in the running for an award.
The classical nominations are divided into 13 categories covering orchestral, opera, choral and solo recordings.
A category for the classic producer of the year features five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Nominations for the classic album are Bruckner's Symphony No. 3 and 4 by the Royal Orchestra of the Concertgebouw; "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by Daugherty of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" by Steven Mackey of the Boston Modern Orchestra and Synergy Vocals; Verquiem Project and Verquiem's Synergy.
In the opera category, the nominees are "Lulu" by Berg of the Royal Opera House Orchestra, "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Adolf Hasse of the Ars Lyrica Houston; "L'Amour de Loin" by Kaija Saariaho of the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Order of the Wanderer" by Rodionsky.
Composers who are in place for the Grammy Awards for contemporary composition count Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a performance recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The 30-minute work is dubbed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" was nominated for his solo instrumental performance with an orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer said he would soon write the 15-minute work specifically for the mandolin performer Avi Avital, who played the concerto with the Metropolis Ensemble, based in New York.
“I wrote it using sounds from the Middle East and a large number of ranges and rhythms from North Africa,” Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received an appointment in the orchestra performance category, for conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Among the instrumental soloists who received a nomination are pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, there are only vocalist-solist nominees; these are: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonov<0xC3><0xA1>, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of classic mixes, soprano Jessye Norman received a nomination for her recording "Roots: My Life, My Song"
The Temecula mosque project was approved by the Planning Commission.
A mosque project in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often passionate.
Critics of the project claimed that it was promoting both terrorism and traffic jams.
But the commissioners ruled Wednesday night that the new religious center respects local laws and that it would be aesthetically impressive.
“A lot of good people have come to support him: Christians, Jews, Bah<0xC3><0xA1>’<0xC3><0xAD>s, you mention him,” Hadi Nael, president of the Temecula Valley Islamic Center, said in a statement.
"I'm proud of it, as an American citizen."
“It shows that justice prevails.”
“The opposition is really minimal,” he added.
"They just have very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The session began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with, most of the time, people voting for or against the center, at roughly equally distributed speaking time, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
“There is no more America,” one speaker wrote.
"This is another planet of monkeys with Miss Liberty dead in the sand."
“America has fallen.”
Planned Islamic centers have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including at Ground Zero, the site of the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush denounced the violence in the Temecula Valley.
Her congregation of about 135 families co-existed without incident in Riverside County for years but she wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse she rented on a shared property with a manufacturer of water filtration systems.
The new 24,943-square-foot mosque with Mediterranean-style architecture would consist of two minarets and rise to 43 feet high.
It would occupy a 4.32 hectare site on Nicolas Road about two miles east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal against this project to the city council.
An arsenic-tolerant microbe raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacterium, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, broadens the field to find new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacterium here on Earth, they say it shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
"This organization has a double capacity."
"It can develop either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
“That’s why it’s very special, even though it’s far from being a truly ‘foreign’ form of life,” said Paul Davies C. W. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report in Thursday’s online edition of the journal Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential to life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
But researchers have discovered that the bacterium, discovered in Lake Mono, California, is able to continue to develop after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"We're wondering what's still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important in the search for life beyond Earth because researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, Anbar says.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not disclose the details of the discovery, generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could reveal the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
That was not the case.
The discovery "shows that, in other planetary environments, organisms might be able to use other elements to power biochemistry and that the "standard" set of elements, which we deem absolutely necessary for life, might not be fixed," commented Charles Cockell, a professor at the Institute for Planetary and Space Research, Keyton, Open University.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element to another in fundamental biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It was no accidental discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Institute of Astrology, who led the study, chose Lake Mono because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; thus, she speculated that a microbe exposed to the two substances might be able to substitute for each other.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is really similar to that of phosphorus."
"As a result, organisms find it difficult to distinguish these elements separately."
"But arsenic is different enough that it doesn't work exactly like phosphorus; it enters the interior and, in a way, gums up the work of our biochemical machine," Anbar explained.
The researchers collected the bacterium known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing concentrations of arsenic to which it was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a life form using arsenic can occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus was not new; but nothing ever showed that it could work.
Arsenic was more common at the beginning of the Earth's existence, she said; thus, the researchers hypothesized that early life forms could have used it.
This suggests that there could be other ways to shape life, not just the way life on Earth was formed in the beginning,” said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon’s research team.
The research was funded by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two stolen exhibition dogs have been found in Compton
The other two out of four exhibit dogs stolen from a motel in Bellflower were found, Los Angeles County Sheriffs announced on Thursday.
The four show dogs - two Akitas and two Welsh Pembroke Corgis - went missing Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express van in which they had spent the night outside a Bellflower Motel 6, authorities said.
Two of the dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found late in the evening Wednesday, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.
“The good news is that dogs are doing well,” Whitmore said.
"They're in good shape."
"They have been returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs had been found, in what neighborhood and under what circumstances they had been found.
"An investigation is underway."
"We don't want to say it," Whitmore said.
"We're following orders."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be joined to provide a comment Thursday.
They met Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas at a county animal shelter in Downey.
Sheriff's assistants found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were safe and sound, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis that Rickard and Peek had planned to show at regional competitions this week, on behalf of the owners of the Japanese dogs, were missing until their discovery on Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of the Long Beach national championship "AKC/Eukanuba", where they planned to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to compete in other events scheduled in the days leading up to the "AKC/Eukanuba" exhibition, Peek told the Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the couple’s nearly month-long dog show tour.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van outside, right next to their bedroom window.
They took three other dogs - a Boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier and a Breton Spaniard - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and the corgis, with the thicker fur, in the van where it would be cooler.
They opened the windows a little, so that the dogs could have a fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the theft of the van at 6 a.m. Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could drive them to the corgis, equipped with a microchip implanted to identify them.
It is not clear if an award was given on Thursday.
The lion is ready to blush again, the restructuring of MGM is waiting for the final green light of the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start from scratch.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York on Thursday officially praised the creditors' "prepackaged" plan that would wipe out about $5 billion in debt; paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on producing and distributing movies and television shows.
With Thursday’s decision that the plan satisfies the requirements of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, there are no longer any legal obstacles before MGM to get back on track under the tutelage of Entertainment Spyglass founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the CEOs of what will be an outgoing studio.
Staff will be reduced to about 320 out of 400 at the start.
MGM will not really emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has concluded a $500 million credit facility, planned to fund MGM’s new operations and productions.
It is currently licensed by the investment bank, which is battling itself at $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The restructuring process of the studio began in May 2009 when investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to invest its finances as it did not have the means to pay interest of $300 million per year.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and a recovery expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper’s attempts to solve MGM’s financial difficulties and satisfy the studio’s more than 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed at the end of 2009 to put the company up for sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders, none of whom were willing to pay the additional $2 billion the creditors were looking for.
In the spring of this year, everything had to be done again as the MGM team had begun work on a restructuring plan that, after months of disagreement and internal debate, was finally approved by the creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially goes out of bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies receive multi-million dollar premiums for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper’s companies, which have raised $375,000 per month for their corporate management services, will receive a “success premium” of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to relaunch the production of MGM, which only released one film this year, and set up an annual list of seven or eight films that would be released as of 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit", with Warner Bros.
The studio must take out a separate loan between $265,000 and $275 million to fund its share in both films, which are to be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM’s debt, has attempted to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies have not resulted in an agreement.
Tech toys to keep your gift budget in balance
Although the top candidate for this year’s most wonderful toy is the IPAD, followed, perhaps, by Microsoft’s video game system, Kinect, both can make a significant breach in your gift budget.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five $99 BMX bikes and that a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 classic beads jumping ropes, or about 48 Play-Doh boxes.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three domestic toy vendors - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and Wholesale Club of BJ - to see the electronic toys I could buy for under $80.
Clearly Moore’s Law has evolved, this year’s tech toy is likely to have more strength; while costing the same price if not a little less, compared to last year.
Also, while there are generally fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the most well-known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And the button battery toys are on the rise, as are the rechargeable battery toys.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise stated.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and over) are stuffed toys the size of an Indian pig that sing a note when you press them on the belly.
One pressure is equal to one note, and a second one makes it possible to compose a song.
If you buy several, they will sing in harmony.
Attention: once you start pressing, you can no longer stop.
To combine singing with dancing, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and over) is the best choice.
Inspired by last year’s Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays role-playing games like Simon Says and can do lunar dance thanks to its innovative articulated feet with wheel lock.
Children who have wiped the toy use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain of a lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you will remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
It’s back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40 for 3 years and over), with a backpack filled with questionnaire playing cards designed to turn a car ride into a session with a self-correction and a valve magazine.
If you are suspicious when your child is holding your smartphone, here are three standalone alternatives.
The Mobigo from VTech ($60, for 3- to 8-year-olds) is the cheapest and easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although the games do not educate as effectively as the Explorer Leapster ($70, for 3- to 12-year-olds), it is the first major revision of the Leapster range, with a newer and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
The Fisher-Price iXL ($90, for ages 3 to 7) uses an iTunes-like system to offer games and e-books and has an SD card input that allows you to view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8-year-olds and older) is a set of five blocks barely larger than a matchbox, each with its own LED display.
The goal is to form words by placing the blocks online before time runs out, which is ideal for an impromptu spelling contest.
Increasingly, toys have some sort of online connection.
Based solely on their presence in toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online pet from Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for 6-12 year olds) that includes a piece marked with a hidden code.
When you redeem the code online, your child receives enough credits at the Club Penguin store for two items to choose from.
It can be roller skates or a pet toy Puffle.
Slightly larger than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and more) is the latest button-stacked microrobot.
The fake beast moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone pastes in random directions.
It’s fun to make a maze of blocks to see if she can find her way through.
It is also solid.
Ours resisted a fall from the kitchen table and even a momentary passage in our dog's mouth.
Bringing a softer side to maintaining order in China
Tang Shenbin walked a town square like an urban sergeant in training by rigorously inspecting his nerve charges, issuing low-pitched orders with military authority.
He wanted the female members of Chengguan—imposing officials of public order in China, feared and despised for their arbitrary repression and their penchant for violence—to convey some impression to a group of spectators.
"Stand up straight!"
"Be perceptive!"
Show them, he said, "what do pretty girls look like!"
Four girls who had barely spent their teenage years in white gloves, dressed in identical olive-coloured jackets and pants, were staring at you.
Four pairs of black heeled shoes, aligned to the rule.
Four well-groomed hats perfectly perched on the top of hair tied by a striped knot in blue and white.
“Personally, I think they look average,” Tang said, disdainfully.
"The models are pretty."
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of China’s urban inspectors.
A city has demanded that all new recruits have a higher education degree.
The province of Guangdong has traded the grey-green of the uniforms for a so-called more engaging blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced eyelashes with the strong way: In 2009, a report reported that 50 officers had surrounded an uncontrollable snack trolley by casting black glances, firmly for half an hour, until the colporteur packed his stuff and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen to do a large image operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its street police in the urban environment of 13 women, specially chosen for their appearance, their age and their young age.
The idea is to give the police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson may have trouble catching a glimpse of this underground urban brigade from China
And for a reason, critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to enforce municipal orders by imposing fines or other administrative sanctions.
But the Chinese media portrays the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, Hubei province inspectors beat an observer to death after he used his mobile phone to film them dispersing a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors, robbed and put online, described how to effectively defeat offenders without spilling blood.
This year in Shanghai, a watermelon colporteur was abandoned with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A video game impregnated with violence, available online, shows Chinese inspectors trained to assault street vendors.
“Chengguan has marked the government,” China Daily, a national publication, lamented last year after yet another controversy over tactics.
The newspaper called for “real thorough cleaning.”
Skeptics say the approach is far from that.
After the district passed an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial, published in The Beijing Evening News, wondered if the women had real tasks or if they were just a tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district’s announcement required female candidates, aged 18 to 22, to have a beautiful silhouette and “the five facial features in the right order.”
They must be above average size, either 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is mandatory.
Officers said the work was physically too painful for women over the age of 25.
"It's their image that's important," a certain district officer told Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they are suitable; it is the size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temperament and the "inner qualities."
The women of Chengguan are like flower vases, he said, adding: "In addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the City District Management Office, does not adhere to this description.
But he noted that height requirements were the standard standard in many Chinese job offers for both sexes.
This is the case with the requirement relating to the order of the facial features.
What this means beautiful is a topic of debate among the Chinese.
Disabled or disfigured persons should not apply.
“We can’t let a boxing person or a boss come to serve here,” Zheng said.
“It wouldn’t give a good image.”
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old and has pommeled cheeks with a finely curved mouth.
She doesn’t consider highlighting her appearance to be sexist, she says.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with a disillusioned look.
Xu Yang, his 21-year-old coworker at the pits, says, "Our job is to present the image of the city."
They do not object to their mandate being limited, they said, because they nurture greater career ambitions than simply driving sellers into the alleys where they are supposed to limit their activities.
Every morning, the team confronts a dozen walking merchants who move quickly on foot or by bike, trying to sell as many rolls or bowls of tofu as possible before fleeing.
"Master Wang, you must leave."
"We've already told you several times!" said Ms. Xu as a salesman ran away on foot, temporarily abandoning his noodle-cart bike.
Agents describe their functions as more monotonous than arduous.
“It’s pretty much the same every day,” said Huang Jing, 20, who studies post-work marketing.
"Great routine."
One of the reasons is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate sellers’ property.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from the sudden public exposures of animosity against the bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, revolted after false rumors spread that Chengguan agents had killed a salesman.
In one night, more than a dozen police and Chengguan officers were injured, 14 government vehicles were toppled or set on fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But the calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the placid Baoguang Square, where female officers were patrolling that morning, more than 50 people gathered around the corner.
Officers confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as required by regulations.
The owner of the motorcycle was shouting scandal.
A 15-minute iron arm followed before the police, with the sinister face, paved an elbow-strike path towards their vehicle and set off at full speed with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator attached to the men's team, stayed behind, his white badge returned to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators - men aged 40 years and older - purely play a supporting role.
Unlike them, they are not trained in order to maintain a waxed image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
“Sometimes we fight physically,” Mr. Li said in a neutral tone.
“Most of the time, it’s the audience that starts.”
Prosecutors won't indict Senator Ensign
Attorneys at the Department of Justice lifted criminal charges against Senator John Ensign, stemming from a case involving an assistant to a former campaign and his efforts to get a lobbying job for the woman's husband, the senator's lawyers announced Wednesday.
The decision puts an end to the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate in 2012 until the scandal surrounding his case made headlines nationally last year and hurt his career.
Mr Ensign's office said he was "very happy" with the decision, the result of a one-year investigation.
The senator could still be exposed to disciplinary action by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers stated that the Department of Justice had "informed that Senator Ensign is no longer the subject of the investigation and that he does not intend to maintain any charges against him in this case."
The Ministry of Justice refrained from commenting on the matter.
The announcement came as a kind of surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, according to which there was significant evidence indicating that Mr. Ensign had conspired to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, emails and other documents, first reported in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, get a lucrative lobbying job to win the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once served as treasurer during an Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political funders to find work for Mr. Hampton and then he defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them; in accordance with the documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been an employee of Mr. Ensign, he was prohibited for one year by law from lobbying his former employer or the Senate as a whole.
Ethics experts argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, seems to contradict the so-called lobbying backdoor ban.
According to the evidence that has been made public, “there appears to be prima facie evidence of a plot to violate and substantial violation of the revolving door law,” said Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney who specializes in advocating clients for a government investigation.
Although the department judge refused to explain the reasoning that led to the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the department appeared to be wary of political prosecutions after a number of high-level setbacks cashed in by its public integrity section.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid to take up arms, said Melanie Sloan, the general director of citizens for accountability and ethics in Washington, a defense group that has received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don't apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign's chief lawyer, said in an interview Monday that he had received a phone call from a Justice Department prosecutor and follow-up the next day, telling him that the department was not seeking charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's team of lawyers had cooperated with prosecutors to try to persuade them that the senator, as his office reaffirmed Wednesday in a statement, "had acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had made in the prosecution.
“I’m not comfortable going into the details of my discussions with the Department of Justice, except to say that we think they made the right decision,” he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to drop an investigation following an independent complaint by the ethics group, arguing that Mr. Ensign's parents' payment of $96,000 to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The Electoral Commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a major Nevada corporation that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company welcomed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he was "hammering" the Department of the Interior on a disputed issue.
Mr. Ensign also attended a lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and asked the Secretary of Transportation to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after hiring Mr. Hampton to lobby.
When news of the case surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned from his position as the fourth-ranked Republican in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign said two weeks ago that he intended to run for a third term in the Senate.
Announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hoped that the ethics committee would quickly follow the lead of the Department of Justice and end its investigation.
Senator Ensign is pleased to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she said.
Cheshire's call will point to Twitter
A half-dozen of them were tapping away in the ranks of the courtroom.
They sent every minute reports of horrific testimonies via Twitter.
In the end, the defense said there were more than 140,000 messages about the rape case trial and children tied to their bed in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the widely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was found guilty of the murder of three members of the Cheshire family in Connecticut, is expected to result in an official end where the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed evidence in court that outlines arguments of appeal, likely to occupy the courts for years.
What is provocative is that the intense reporting on the trial – as well as the widespread and widespread use by Twitter journalists – has created a “circus atmosphere”, a saturation so widespread and instantaneous with incendiary details that the jury has been badly influenced by the public’s passions.
The application could prompt appellate judges to debate whether new technologies require new rules in courtrooms.
“I have experienced it in this trial; I think there is a real danger that the introduction of new technologies in courtrooms is violating human rights to a fair trial,” said Thomas J. Ullmann, attorney for Mr. Hayes, chief attorney.
The trial judge, Jon C. Bleue of the Superior Court of State, laconically dismissed the claims in last week’s ruling, saying that the media were “carefully controlled” and that there was no evidence that the jury was animated by passion.
But that doesn’t seem to be the last word on the issue.
Courts of appeal have recognized for decades that media coverage of notorious cases can raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a landmark 1966 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, arguing in his ruling that there was a "carnival atmosphere at trial" because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and the film "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers have stated that the appellate courts seized to review Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later may be curious given the argument that new rules might be needed to manage the media in the courtrooms, unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There's a general reason to be concerned about the impact of new media" in large-scale trials, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that it was arbitrarily enforced.
Professor Donohue argues that some appellate judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting instant communication from courtrooms could allow for fairer trials.
The case of Twitter is just one of many others described by Mr. Hayes’ lawyers, likely to be discussed for years; which delays execution.
Defense lawyers also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes was harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them gruesome photos of criminal scenes when selecting the jury.
Some of the jurors said they were horrified by the photos of the victims, 48-year-old Jennifer Hawke-Petit, and her daughters, 17-year-old Hayley, and 11-year-old Michaela.
Defense lawyers say they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and that they will argue that the judge unfairly expelled one of the jurors, who had been critical of prosecutors, and that he abusively put pressure on a verdict by making the unusual decision to take the jury out.
The jurors were not kidnapped.
But their arguments about the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial could be the biggest source of interest.
They noted in a protest against the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and that it was being discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and in the United States Senate.
They maintained that the computer media continued to ignite the flames of emotion in the case.
“The daily tumult of tweets from media, cameras and journalists in front of the courthouse,” the lawyers wrote, “did not resemble anything that had been seen before here in New Haven, and perhaps even nationally.”
Their focus on the coverage of the Twitter system is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists stated that the claim that instant news was more incendiary than slower releases was a luddist view that would impoverish the Court’s policy governing media coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers have stated that appeals courts are often attracted by arguments that social and technological changes require adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers insist on this claim.
In their file, they make reference to the 1966 Supreme Court decision that overturned Dr. Sheppard's conviction due to media coverage of the trial and they specified that they would invoke the need for new rules for new media.
"This case," they wrote, "represents that of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can civility bring rifts closer together?
After a campaign marked by invective and negativity, a minimum of civility erupted in Washington this week.
Is this a warning sign of true forward bipartisan cooperation or an illusory moment before the rapid return to partisan struggle in the capital?
Tuesday’s meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders produced no breakthroughs on the major issues that need to be addressed during the “lazy duck” session.
But obviously, there was at least a polite discussion about the differences between the two parties as well as the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each camp wanted to score points.
The committee’s Wednesday public meeting on the president’s deficit was just as civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created a mutual respect that transcends the ideological divide; but which, however, still divides the members.
It is hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
The two sides are now in a period of mutual testing and testing for signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and voters' patience for a renewed partisan war.
That is why Tuesday's meeting and subsequent comments from the participants revealed a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and Republicans are too big and too deep to suggest a rapid climate change that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it's taxation, spending, health care, or rights, the two sides remain miles away.
Yet the November election had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed on the tone," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official, now at the Center for Ethical and Public Policy.
"It's inevitable after the election.
The elections arouse partisan passions, and then they fade away.
That's good."
On some issues, including those on the agenda of the “stupid duck” session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush’s tax cuts will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favor of it.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve some or all of them, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise on extending unemployment benefits is conceivable, even if Republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favour of tax cuts for the rich, while denying unemployment benefits to unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, more optimism is about a possible agreement on the issues raised during the session on the "lazy duck", with the ratification of the "New START" pact.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that fruitful cooperation on the most pressing issues of the Blade Duck session will not necessarily lead to better understanding between the two parties when the 112th Congress meets in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is likely, if not inevitable.
“Once the things that need to be done will be done, psychology in the short term will come back to one of the confrontations,” he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared skepticism that civility would lead to genuine cooperation.
"I consider most of what is happening between today and 2012 as a pre-show or shadow-boxing compared to the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this are closely related to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and the tea voters who contributed to its creation.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know that they must try to live up to their promises to cut public spending and repeal the new health care law.
These partisan positions are already clear in the initial reactions to the deficit commission's recommendations, which include reforming the tax code and raising certain taxes, raising the retirement age and reducing spending.
Co-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have chosen one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, according to themselves, have imposed the issue of the deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member committee to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they have struggled to reach that number.
The greatest resistance remains among the group's elected representatives; which suggests that there is little reason or willingness to compromise on tax issues, at least today.
Galston foresees two phases in the fighting between the White House and Republicans in Congress.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan clashes, as Republicans challenge Obama on budget, taxes, and health care; followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would be the cause of the change?
The public opinion.
It is widely proven that, despite the partisan spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties work together.
If the confrontation leads to an impasse, as in 1995, then both parties will carefully observe the reaction of the public.
Whoever is judged to be lost will have to change course and find compromises.
However, that would be an optimistic view.
The partisan spirit and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and Congressional Republicans than there was then between President Bill Clinton and Republicans.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a more consistent election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civility exhibited this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on the part of both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
U.S. documents leaked describe Moscow as a haven of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of a "Kleptocracy" and passes some of the bribes and protective money it collects to the Kremlin, the U.S. Embassy in Russia said in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service are making huge rockets that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They raise money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy – what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the “vertical of power” – takes its share as money moves up the ladder.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted by Wikileaks on its website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been purged.
It was written while Yuri Luykov was still mayor of Moscow; and he is largely held responsible for corruption.
He was sacked in October by President Dmitry Medvedev but there have been little traces of cleanup since then.
Loujkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a leading construction company, have consistently denied corruption allegations over the years; and he has won several defamation trials over these allegations.
In September, he said the following to a Russian television channel, when asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: “It’s crazy, it’s throwing, it’s anything.”
The Russians believe, by an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupt; according to polls.
But it is unusual to find the information contained in an embassy report; and it is unusual to imagine that it would be for diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link between the Moscow city government and crime has led some people to call it “dysfunctional” and claim that the government functioned more like a kleptocracy than a government,” according to the embassy note.
“Criminal elements enjoy a “krysha” (a term used in the criminal world/mafia literally meaning “roof” or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor’s office, as well as through the entire bureaucracy of the Moscow city government.
"Analysts identify a three-tiered structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB, the MVD and the militias are on the second level."
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
“This is an inefficient system in which criminal groups fill a void in certain areas where the city does not provide certain services.”
The report indicates that the FSB is making money from the biggest companies and that the police are targeting the small ones.
One source, he said, "explained that Moscow business owners understood that it was better to get the protection of the MVD and the FSB (rather than organized crime groups) because, not only do they have more weapons, more means and more power than criminal groups but they are also protected by the law."
“That’s why the demand for protection by criminal gangs is no longer so high.”
The note notes that although the collection of money is extensive, the protection itself can be unequal; even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who don’t pay quickly see their business closing under one pretext or another.
Medvedev has mentioned the fight against corruption several times, but he has admitted that little progress has been made.
The note from the embassy conveys reports of men bringing suitcases, probably filled with money, to the Kremlin.
“In his fight against corruption, Medvedev relies on the bureaucrats,” said Georgi Satarov, director of Moscow’s Indem think tank.
"But he's part of that bureaucracy."
“He’s not part of a political class because he doesn’t exist in Russia.”
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to the Indem, the cost of corruption would amount, on the whole of Russia, to more than $ 300 billion per year.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent survey on the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are ranked at least the most corrupt).
The disclosure of the note from the US embassy, which was made only yesterday, late in the evening, Moscow time, will certainly stir up discontent within the Russian government; although Luykov may be blamed, to a certain extent, for Moscow's failures, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that it is not.
Interviewed by CNN by Larry King, Putin hypothesized that WikiLeaks documents could be fabricated and reacted with anger to the words that U.S. diplomats had disclosed by calling him Batman and bringing Medvedev closer to Robin.
"The problem is that this is our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
“But to be honest with you, we didn’t suspect it would be accomplished with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, in opposition to ethics.”
Former Khmer Rouge fighters forced to confront the past
In a illuminated classroom with poor-quality decrepit concrete walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School referred to the man who built it, the last leader of the Khmer Rouge, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
“He was a good leader; and he cared about his people,” said 42-year-old Sreng Kor Ma.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality, when he was at the head of the Khmer Rouge, this commander remains popular in this isolated stronghold of former Khmer Rouge in the northwest of Cambodia where he had hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure built; and where thousands of former soldiers still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-standing loyalty is finally called into question in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum allowed the victims to publicly address the people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school manual that, for the first time, teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And in July, a Cambodian court, jointly headed by the United Nations, handed down its first sentence on a former member of the Khmer Rouge, sentenced, to 35 years in prison, the former head of the infamous torture center of Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Yev, better known as "Duch".
Faced with this evolution of the situation, anxiety increased among the Khmer Rouge veterans of Anlong Veng; complicating reconciliation efforts and their willingness to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
“There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge but they are powerless to do anything,” said Chhang Youk, director of Cambodia’s Documentation Centre, an independent body that conducts research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"The situation generates divisions within families."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the government of Pol Pot United in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
There, they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last of the movements surrendered in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrillas from their base in the mountains of western Cambodia and the jungle, Ta Mok prepared a suite at Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to defect to the government, culminating in the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had been the leader, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without their benefactors, most Khmer Rouge veterans have sunk into the black misery common to rural Cambodia; and many remain nostalgic for the movement.
Although some Khmer Rouge elite officers have retained their positions of local leader in exchange for laying down the weapons, they are unqualified farmers with low grade and record.
“These people have benefited from very little follow-up after the surrender,” said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are imbued with the agrarian utopian ideology of the regime."
“They were raised in a setting where doing business is a foreign concept.”
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as a poor rice farmer.
“Life under the Khmer Rouge was good,” he said.
"Ta Mok feeds everyone."
But now life is difficult because we have to provide for our own needs.”
The ongoing Khmer Rouge court has also raised concerns here.
The court is expected to begin the trial of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, earlier this year.
The court's mandate is to try the senior leaders and the main perpetrators of the crimes but it did not say whether it was pursuing beyond these four cases.
It would take more to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculation has turned to 64-year-old Im Chaem, a former district chief in Banteay Meanchey province under the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Documentation Centre of Cambodia that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project where thousands of forced laborers were said to have died.
Recently, on a torrid evening, Im Chaem was returning from work to the field near his wooden house on piles, on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past among the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she said, she would refuse to go.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable," she said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected to the Khmer Rouge in 1978, also warned on several occasions that instability would occur if the court prosecuted several suspects; although experts and historians dispute this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But confronting the past is all Cambodia has to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang, from the documentation center.
"The reconciliation in Khmer terms is to reconnect the broken pieces," he said.
“We have to put these pieces together so we can understand.”
The center produced the first government-approved manual on the Khmer Rouge, "A History of Democratic Kampuchea, Composed of 75 Pages."
He distributed it to Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the history books of the Ministry of Education, designed for colleges, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most Cambodia, the youth of Anlong Veng know only a few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's ties to the regime.
Touch Valeak, a 19-year-old student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he returned home with the book to study.
“My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court,” he said.
“They are suspicious because they don’t know exactly how many people the court will prosecute.”
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, the manual and the court are beginning to have an impact, he said.
Yet the Khmer Rouge retains a powerful attraction here.
In the heights of the Dangrek Mountains, a path, overrun by weeds and dotted with plastic bags, leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusted sheet metal roof.
Pol Pot’s body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, a 31-year-old cell phone saleswoman on the roadside, said she didn't know much about the man who was cremated at the site.
"But he has a great spirit; and many inhabitants go there to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later that day she planned to walk to Pol Pot's last resting place where she would leave a bouquet of ripe bananas in the hope of bringing luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its military-grade uranium stockpile
The Belarusian government announced Wednesday that it would abandon its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, an essential component of nuclear weapons; this decision comes as part of a surprise victory of President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials around the world.
The agreement was disclosed in a joint statement released after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a security summit.
The U.S. government had been trying for years to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and appeared to have cleared the horizon last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that some classified operations have been carried out with Belarus in the past two months to remove 187 pounds of military-grade uranium from a Belarusian research center.
This paved the way for an agreement Wednesday to eliminate the rest of the matter of about 500 pounds, according to an official who raised the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit, organized at the initiative of Obama; where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was profitable to provide an invitation to the former Soviet republic following the summit in 2012.
“I’m really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.”
“This proves to me that this process is working,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a nuclear security advocacy group.
Clinton called the agreement a "very significant, important step" by Belarus.
Obama pledged in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world over the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said the nation would never give up its uranium.
“We have kept highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military grade uranium and low-enriched uranium,” Lukashenko said.
“It’s our product ... We’re not going to make dirty bombs, and we’re not going to sell it to anyone.”
“We’re going to use it for research, that’s all.”
Belarus came closer to the United States a few months ago; however, by showing interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to remove uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material had been slightly irradiated, officials said.
It was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to an installation in Russia to be stored and disposed of, officials said.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was carried out by plane, according to officials.
The U.S. government has spent $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace Belarus’ research facilities with low-enriched uranium; unsuitable for weapons.
“A careful coordination and organization has been put in place to build trust,” said Andrew Bieniawski, a head of the Department of Energy specializing in Global Threat Reduction.
According to estimates from the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, Belarus had at least 88 pounds of military grade uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus is seeking to eliminate its stocks by 2012, according to a joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly due to the harsh human rights repression by Lukashenko.
But Wednesday’s statement suggested a potential revival.
“While welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus recognized that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remained essential to improving bilateral relations; and indispensable to the progress of the country and its citizens,” she said.
The government has not issued any objections to CIA thefts
The government has issued no objection to CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners heading for Guantanamo through Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the U.S. ambassador to Madrid.
This is demonstrated by documents leaked (cables) by Wikileaks to the daily El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s, which add that the first vice-president of the government of that time, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Teresa Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez de la Vega, had asked for the Spanish Executive to be informed to "be able to demonstrate that they were exercising adequate vigilance over them".
In June 2006, following a Council of Europe report accusing a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in human rights abuses, a meeting was held between former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "surprised the Zapatero Government off-the-shelf" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide there.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objection with regard to intelligence thefts over Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "taken without", Aguirre says in a cable.
The then Foreign Ministry official, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel Moratinos, told the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this case the lowest possible profile, even if, as it was in the hands of the judges, the Government had limited capacity to influence."
In turn, in January 2007, prosecutor Vicente Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez transmitted to the Embassy the fact that he would not block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Department of Defense on CIA thefts.
"These reports contain no incriminating elements, no sensitive information," the embassy said after speaking with the prosecutor.
The United States, however, expressed concern about "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" rather than about the Department of Defense's declassified CNI information.
“This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to maneuver the case discreetly between the Governments,” regrets Aguirre.
In March 2007, during a lunch between the U.S. Ambassador and the Minister of Internal Affairs, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the latter commented that "even though the Spanish judges are madly jealous of its independence and will do what they deem appropriate", he had given instructions to his collaborators on how to "respect" them.
The Ambassador also expresses concern about the PP's action in this matter.
"Despite its pro-American general orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will certainly take advantage of any indication that the Zapatero government has tolerated or deliberately ignored actions by the United States that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if those revelations have negative consequences for the United States."
The parricide that went to confession complained in network of the "absurdity" of being a mother
The girl was talking about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror to the Galician"
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Juanatey Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez is "Muki" in the network.
With this nickname that she used as a child, she communicated with a cousin and at least a friend, both of whom originated from Noia, the village of Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a from which she originated.
The messages are from 2008.
To hear them, you need to know his sentimental life, which ABC builds with the help of his parents' testimonies.
The 30-year-old Galician girl had started a relationship in 1998 with industrialist Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n T<0xC3><0xBA><0xC3><0xB1>ez.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Shortly after they broke up, we found out she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him get tested for DNA.
We discovered another new boyfriend shortly after that.
The elected was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighbouring municipality.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar had lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to survey the labor market, the boy stayed with his partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But according to the content of his communications, we hear that their idyll has fractured, they have separated.
In March 2008, she was alone in Menorca, writing: “Alberto is very strange and angry that I came to work there.”
"When I told him, it seemed like a good thing, but of course, he now realizes what it means to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do what he wants."
And then she talks about a mobile message she had just received: "I want you to come home this month or you give me an address to send you the child."
Ella complains, "If he doesn't like it, let him leave the kid with my mother, and I'll take it when I get home," she alleges.
In May, she talks about returning to her village: "This week I am leaving, but I will only stay there until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to introduce myself to a job so as not to lose it".
She explained that if all went well, she would have taken her eldest with her.
“He’ll stay with the right person, that is, with me, and I’ll never leave him out of my life with another person unless that person is my mother.”
In July, there is another post.
When she taps him, it is assumed that the child, who arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and was supposedly murdered on the 10th, died.
“Caesar is happy on one side, but he is not happy on the other.”
"On the one hand he's with me and he likes this place a little bit, but on the other he goes to school almost every day."
He is talking about a trip to Mallorca.
"There will be (the child) a few hours in the summer and so I save some money from the babysitter."
On the 17th, greetings and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you will come."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos in the email, you see, when he wants it, he finds me, shit."
On the 30th, another: "The child is fine, he goes to the summer hours to learn Catalan.
On V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor, his current partner, there is one: "He advances me with money".
On the Internet she has messages in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of her own in the MySpace universe, now blocked, where her name was "Muki the Prison Liberator."
"Terror to the Galician (epigraph) ".
The last man who lived with her, vigilant, declares his regret to feel guilty.
He doesn’t want to think that it was all over so she didn’t tell him that she was a single mother.
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica entered the Palma Provincial Penitentiary yesterday from the Menorca Judicial Detention Centre.
The lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that she does not remember how the events had happened, "and she also did not intend to harm the minor".
Before that, she had confessed to drowning Caesar in the bathtub and putting his body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor have requested a psychiatric examination.
People's Party members would win 4 seats in Congress and PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in votes and deputies registered in the last autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already targeted the generals because, even if there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes that this formation receives in these committees normally doubles that it receives in the Catalans.
Thus, the Catalan people obtained 610,473 votes in the generals of 2008, while in the autonomouss of 2006, they had obtained 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC received 384,091 votes.
If we maintain this upward trend, desired by a diversion of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the electorate of the PP, the analysts of this formation calculated the fact that, if there were general elections, the PPC could go from 8 to 12 deputies in the Congress, while CiU has no more than 9 deputies in the Congress and will not have more than 10 deputies in the Congress.
These calculations would find that the Catalan square is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to popular analysis, ERC would lose one MP – it has three now – while ICV would either keep one MP or win one.
But if the electoral agenda is maintained, the next meeting would take place in May 2011 for the municipal committees, where the people can also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relay at the head of the General Council of Barcelona 2011, one of the administrations that handles the highest budget - 661 million.
Both the nationalists and the popular agree that PSC could lose the city halls of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not get a majority either the opportunity to resort to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Taking into account the republican debacle, it would not be fancy that this formation loses its representation in the city hall of Barcelona - it is necessary to get 5% of the votes.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP recorded only a difference of 500 votes from PSC, whose mayor, <0xC3><0x80>ngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met several times.
People have also made progress in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
The PP is now present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to make lists in a maximum number of localities.
Catalan Cell Facilitates Thousands of Passports to Al Qaeda
Apart from the seven detainees in Barcelona, in Thailand, there were three
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian detained by agents of the General Information Police Office of Barcelona in 2008 formed a jihadist cell which, directed from Thailand, facilitated passports to various Al Qaeda groups, among which "Tigers for the Liberation of the Earth Tamil" (LTTE) and "Tigers for the Liberation of the Earth Tamils" (LTTE) and "Tigers for the Liberation of the Earth Tamils" (LTE) (LTTE) and "TB).
The Ministry of the Interior has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with "Operation Kampai" the Al Qaeda counterfeiting apparatus at the international level has "been weakened" and "therefore, its operational capability".
Investigators calculate that the cell, in the two years during which it was active in Catalonia, could have sent thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to groups that integrated the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda so that its "fighters" could cross the borders of Europe and other Western countries with an impunity.
The dismantled cell is not the only one that the jihadist network was operating in Europe, which is why in the investigations took part, apart from Thai services, other European police units, which is why in the territory of the European Union there could be in the following days similar shots to that recorded last night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis were detained by Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade), but in Thailand they carried out the Atharmane and the Atharmane, with the tak
They were the ones who ran from Bangkok the cell located in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of which was hit in 2009 - mainly stole passports from tourists that met the conditions marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents had to be in the name of young men between the ages of 25 and 45, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
The investigators point out that so far no details have been found linking detainees in Catalonia to the Bombay attack, even though the perpetrator of the attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the recipient groups of passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that a few days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia they sent through a transfer agency a few thousand dollars that were "invested" to buy mobile cards that were then used by members of the "commando" that killed 106 people.
The police have taken over a lot of documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend tax complicity
The leader of the PPC, Alicia S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose to Artur Mas his conditions to support his inauguration as president of the Generalitat, identical to those exposed during the campaign and who are determined to give priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of adventures as his national philo-souvernist approach is the philo-sou.
The president of the Catalan people came to an appointment with Artur Mas with the security that gives the fact that he got 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, a number more than enough to be liked, because the candidate of CiU requires that at least one of the formations that the opposition will exercise abstain in the vote of the investiture.
On a possible agreement with the PP depend the future alliances that the nationalists wish to maintain in the Congress during the general elections, but, for the moment, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of the political leaders are being held in Catalan key.
And as for the PP president, to support an inauguration "it would be necessary to eliminate all sovereignist and independenceist speeches", and economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque country - that the convergent leader wants to submit even to the referendum.
The two leaders have in common their gamble to weaken the political apparatus of a highly exaggerated autonomous administration and the elimination of the tax applied to inheritances and donations.
Details of the negotiation on the investment of Mas will be handled by PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a tough opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciudadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatrician says that the deaths were not due to the "lack of measures"
The owners of the center of Olot does not eliminate the possibility that their night nurse killed more than 11 elderly people
The officials of the geriatrician La Caritat d'Olot (Girona) offered a press conference yesterday to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behavior of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly people for whom he was responsible in the interval he worked there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, presented himself accompanied by the center's lawyer, Joan Ca<0xC3><0xB1>ada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to exercise the charge against the person responsible" for the dead, but "the legality and responsibility oblige us to assume the procedural situation of civil officials".
And apart from the social discredit that the entity may suffer for not detecting the criminal activities of the night nurse in time, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of a significant compensation that the legal representatives of the parents of the victims are already calculating.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates from August 2009 and that from that day he has not stopped killing.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former geriatric patients - since he suspected that in many cases no doctor would personally examine the deceased but, given the age and pathologies of the patients, the formality took place by telephone.
Caritat, through its director, categorically denied this situation yesterday and said that "the lack of measures can never have been the cause of what happened".
La Caritat's lawyer added that "in this case there is only an indication of recklessness on the part of any other person than the accused."
The person already named “The Angel of Death” confessed to 11 murders yesterday and detailed that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case, he caused her death by injecting her with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mix of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat mentioned the fact that it is difficult to control the access of the staff of the center to medicine.
Insulin injections and the sedative cocktail had been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his desire to relieve the suffering of inmates, used to kill them.
But the lab tests will clarify if Vila doesn't lie by saying that he sought for his first victims a less cruel death or on the contrary he burned them inside by giving them laundry as he already confessed he did with the three women he killed between 12 - 17 October.
The Caritat does not believe the statements of the night nurse, nor the number of confessed murders, they do not eliminate the possibility that the number is greater and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila gave in his visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in the change of the way to kill after.
That is why they declare that they will remain at the disposal of the judiciary to clarify the scope of the facts.
The ECB threat
Investors reacted abruptly yesterday to Trichet’s threat that “markets should not underestimate our responsiveness.”
Peripheral differentials have closed by force and European banks’ shares have suffered more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we must not underestimate the ECB's ability to make mistakes and the euro has barely seen an increase, which is a worrying signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market that in the same way it collapses, it recovers, but motivated by short and highly speculative position closures.
The institutional investor will be slow to lose fear.
A month ago, the ECB summoned us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those that remain.
The Bundesbank demanded the completion of the public debt purchase plan due to its inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures in the future and leaving only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis, we hope to extend current liquidity measures "at least until March" and maintain quarterly auctions with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We hope that the bond purchase programme will continue and that there will even be a signal of intensification.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue to be blinded to withdraw the liquidity measures, may God help us!
Just as during their May meeting in which they claimed they had not even considered buying bonds and they collapsed markets, history could repeat itself tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse in the market.
Yesterday the one-year pension auction in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only $500 million at 5.28% compared to $750 million at 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the guys in Portugal dropped 30 basis points throughout the curve, and clearly reflecting a shift in market sentiment after Trichet’s words.
In Ireland, the figures for the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole have been published.
The estimated figures represent 10,000 million short-term and 15,000 potential and they have until February to obtain private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are assumable in the Assistance Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
Nevertheless, next Tuesday, the Government will have to get parliamentary approval of its new budget and it does not yet have sufficient support, therefore Ireland remains in a focal point of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech to ease tensions before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest is the hymn of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures that the Council of Ministers will approve on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment ring to the ears of investors like the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish Stock Exchange has suffered 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike in February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain was quick and radical and we are enjoying the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we hope that it will resolve with strong demand and help to dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to request a Plan of Assistance would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a liquidity line that we don’t need, the Treasury has over 40,000 million in liquidity available, three times as much as March, to very expensive types and they cut off access to the markets sine die.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife, "besides being, it seems".
Courage, we can get away with it!
The president of Eulen will challenge the council of Vega Sicilia requested by his sons
The storm does not stop in the open conflict within the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, the founder of the group, will contest, as he considers it "zero by law", the judiciary council of El Enebro the next 16, requested by five of his seven sons in which they will try to assert their majority and seize the management bodies of the holding firm of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez and his sons Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s David and Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a José grant their legal battery for the new chapter of their litigation for control on one side of the group.
The founder of the largest holding company of business services for companies does not appear to be willing to cede in his dispute to be present in the governing bodies of El Enebro.
From his board of directors he was excluded by five of his seven sons who appointed themselves directors in the shareholders' meeting of January 18 this year whose contestation is registered in the Register of Trade and Companies.
The El Enebro Judicial Council for the next 16, convened by the Madrid Commercial Magistrate No. 2, reopened the thunderbox within the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family.
The use of the judge to determine the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantees the convening of the assembly.
The latest move by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira <0xC3><0x81>lvarez Mezquiriz is described by David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez as a "desperate recourse of the claimants to his five sons to try, through a procedural argument, by clearly deceiving the law and abusing the right, to validate and correct according to the January-to-January official assembly".
This argument will be the basis on which, once the assembly is held, it will be challenged on the grounds that it is "no by right".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully for the magistrate to convene an assembly in June.
In El Enebro, a holding company of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez’s sons control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the services group nevertheless solicits usufruct on 51% of the capital, according to familiar protocols.
This case is the substantive question that the judge must decide after the hearing on the application for challenge for which there is not yet a reported date.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
A software creates improvements on cars in real time.
As soon as Red Bull entered the Formula 1 world in 2004, its history in this select world of speed was marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one took into account the options of a new team that had just arrived, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the last phase of the championship they all bet on the Ferrari triumph of Fernando Alonso.
Without lowering the skill as a driver of the champion, the German Sebastien Vette, nor the capacity of the Renault engine that propels his car, in the world of Formula 1, we talk about the legend of the "secret weapon" that the multinational company Siemens put in the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with goals very far from high automotive competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computing instrument has been used to create assembly lines of factories manufacturers from all over the world, power stations, high-precision instruments.
The goal is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding avoidable defects and costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens' industrial division, explains the fact that the use of this computer instrument in its Formula 1 factory allowed Red Bull to create and execute "in a few hours, almost in real time", the modifications, changes and improvements detected during races and trials.
Russwurm explains that the 1992 teams had an average of 10 technicians on their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements to the vehicles each season.
The Red Bull team now employs 180 highly qualified young professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all kinds of modifications on the cars.
The Siemens executive explained that the PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of Red Bull cars except the engine, which is the sole responsibility of Renault.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
The changes can move from simulator virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this madness of technological development there is the amount of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as a limit every season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech plant to create and produce its cars in a locality 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything that happens there is considered "top secret".
The staff for this task has 580 people, including two drivers, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
Red Bull's Formula One hero is arguably the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the energy drink brand has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and no notoriety.
The plant’s chief technology officer, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago it could be said that R&D progress in the case of racing cars accounted for 50% of the wins and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology accounts for 85% of the success, while drivers bring 15% of the added value.
Nevey admits that the Vettels or Webbers will never be replaced by computers, because "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will install 20 clean stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated its first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
It will be the first of the network of 20 stores between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will count this initiative with the 16 zones already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave as an example the redesigned store located on the Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which she has been collaborating for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to establish 200 brand sales points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first openings were in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, although she admitted that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HM Personal Systems assured that the philosophy for the establishment of stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American Group advises and designs exclusive store furniture (with products that can be interactively touched), which will have the same image in Europe.
In addition, HP covers the training of staff at the facilities.
Helena Herrero denied that it is a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of stores claims to "improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in purchasing, support, after-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a world-leading pilot program that solves potential issues with HP’s warranty IT equipment.
An online service connects with a technical center located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days."
"This system is designed specifically for MPEs and users, because the major companies have already contracted technical support services," said Helena Herrero.
Sabadell bets on stealing one million customers from rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, Banco Sabadell CEO Jaime Guardiola thinks 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the debt war.
In spite of this, it foresees a collapse of interest margins, which will be partially compensated by increases in commissions and the price of credit.
Sabadell expects to capture one million private customers in three years, its task to be accomplished.
Sabadell has found a way to operate for the next three years and thus be able to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new master plan in 2011 that will last for three years.
The goal, apart from surviving without the need to resort to FROB's public subsidies, is to gain a market share by attracting one million new private customers - 700,000 if we deduct those who can leave the bank - its great task to be accomplished, because until now this bank had spoiled more SMEs and companies than the private companies.
This year it has captured 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share for individuals is 3.5%, while for companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the productivity bet, or what is the same, of austerity, with cost reduction as the goal, the provocations of which will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the fiscal year.
Few banks now dare to set goals and make them public, as the financial crisis has disrupted all plans of the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalize this year its Optima master plan, established four years ago, although initially the plan was for three years, but the market situation determined its extension for one more year.
Customers who evade savings banks will be its main objective.
During a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult and transcendental" year.
The executive, in fact, thinks that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is fundamental for the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And even though he thinks the debt war — which penalizes margins — is shrinking, the price of the risk premiums that banks and credit unions pay for its issues to obtain liquidity are already shifting to the price of credit to offset the drop in margins.
“The liquidity and financing aspect is structural and will be a factor of pressure on credit.”
“We didn’t tighten the tap, but the differentials are higher,” Guardiola said.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit long-term credit and increase the price of differentials - see CincoD<0xC3><0xAD>as of November 22 and 27.
He also admitted that the banking sector’s trend now “is to increase commissions,” but “there is a competitive framework.”
Sabadell’s master plan is based on organic growth even though, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of conducting corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he assures that in Spain "larger dimensions will be requested."
“Everything will move next year,” he said.
He argues that capital needs "are increasing enormously" and some Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
And he mentions that the FROB can replace the market in fundraising in the case of new recapitalisations.
After reassuring that Sabadell can survive the temporal closure of markets, it has diminished the importance of the fact that some banks are already predicting as a new liquidity crisis.
He points out that it is impossible to issue, but contrary to what happened in June, short-term funding can be obtained through rest, which mitigates the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers among the caisses
The Director-General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a new wave of mergers of savings banks and reiterated the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When the merger process of the Spanish savings banks began, there were several entities that ensured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they reserved for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the general director of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of producing this new wave of operations.
"I think that most of the mergers have been carried out, we cannot say that the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca C<0xC3><0xAD>vica group is a second phase, these are adjustments."
"Most of it has been completed completely; it is possible that instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes have already been carried out under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated a lot in this operation as well," he said.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of Arag<0xC3><0xB3>n Executives and Directors (ADEA), Olavarrieta explained that the concentration process is carried out "at the fastest possible speed and we must be very satisfied in the way it is carried out in the time frames that we have set in the past, not now, with the Banque d'Arag<0xC3><0xB3>n".
“The passage of 45 cash registers with an average of 28,500 million assets volume to 17 with 75,500 million is an unprecedented trial in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to conform to Basel,” he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of rather unsatisfactory opinions about the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of serosity and meaning", because "what the Bank of Spain is doing is reminding that we must respect the deadline before the end of the year".
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all of Europe and "probably" in the world and attributed to people who doubt it a "lack of knowledge".
The leader mentioned that given the current economic situation, "we can stay very calm" with the situation of financial entities and savings banks, a system that has begun a process of concentration "very important" and "goes at the greatest possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector has benefited from the stress tests that the ECB carried out in July.
Zapatero and the German Red Line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but it has set the conditions for the whole Union.
Market tensions have prompted a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero announced new adjustment methods, which range from tax reductions for SMEs, regulation of private investment agencies or the abolition of the 426 euros of unemployment aid without professional contribution to the privatization of the 49% state of AENA, of the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat 30%
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, joins the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel regarding her responsibility to detach the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be mentioned that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another restriction of the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which clashes with that of maintaining the old traditions of most of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on the three possible exits from the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would abandon the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the Mark, although now it seems science fiction, with a very favorable current of opinion, almost 50% of the population.
The third is a redesign of the euro, in line with German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines for countries that transgress them, possible suspensions of payments of one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it has long been defined, therefore now there is no room for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were boosting deficits, the German government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany thought we should do (tax rigor and fiscal stability plans) and what its European partners, including France, were practicing.
The second blow of the Central European country was when Merkel hardly prolonged the decision to save Greece.
From that moment on, it was fiercely criticized, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public and public opinion were against Greece’s rescue.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel again expressed a clear position, calling for the reform of the EU treaties to make possible the rescue of a country and at the same time oblige private lenders to bear a share of the cost.
This position was interpreted as anti-European because it precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest.
But his proposal, although somewhat sweetened, was approved, and in the following months we should witness the Union's reform process that will make these measures possible from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not think it will cross.
And it tells us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which we cannot agree too much, from that date the old functioning of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mark the birth of a new monetary zone, in which countries that break the rules will be severely sanctioned, they may be forced to declare cessation of payments and, in this case, the private sector will also bear a share of the costs.
Germany is signaling to us that we need to follow a strong growth path with high rates of savings and investment, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge gaps in the balance of payments, like the one that presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not be tolerated.
The bet is clear.
And it would be a shame not to hear it.
It is not just about bringing the government deficit back to 3% in 2013.
What we are asked for is much harder.
And what he absolutely should not do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will give us greater peace of mind.
And let us know how to seize the opportunity that we have been given, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also heard of this form and his double statement (the reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with big companies and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite Merkel's criticism, the path has been paved for the thesis that order should be put at home.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and they don’t seem to be moving it.
And among the possibilities that are being considered, one cannot exclude the possibility of leaving a monetary zone too full of small countries.
And in that case, Germany will always be able to tell us that it had warned us of it.
Sport and Fraud of the Law
The tricks similar to those of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate ingenuity but not the will to escape a sanction.
The expulsion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the match on 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League has poured a lot of ink on the anti-sport character of such behavior and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As we know, a few minutes before the end of the game (which their team was already clearly winning), the two players deliberately lost time when they made mistakes in determining the referee to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and since Real Madrid will end up being the leader of his group, the two players will complete the regulatory penalty during the next game of the dam match against Auxerre and will be able to pass without cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA discipline committee sanctioned the team's coach, José Mourinho, and various economic sums to the players involved with two matches.
Provoking a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, but rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, unwritten but followed rules, of this sport.
Part of the debate in the reported case is due to the fact that this had as protagonist a team of the entity of Real Madrid (which in its anthem displays the nobility and honor and who in past occasions has condemned to a fine to its players for similar acts) and to the dramatization provocateur, more of an orchestrated, it seems, by Mochur.
In any case, the debate asks whether this type of behaviour not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, that is, whether these actions commit fraud; because, in fact, they are actions respectful of the sport regulation, but seem to evade its meaning.
The question is to examine the type of harm they cause to the sports mind.
One of the assets that understands the sporting spirit is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that with these actions has not been put in jeopardy, that is, there has been no violent play.
Another of these assets that is alluded to with correct play is to prevent the team of the offending players from unfairly profiting from the other team, which is not the case either.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of Real Madrid players is that it does not accommodate what is normally characterized as cheating o fraud of the law, because its violation of the rules was not done in secret to try to avoid the penalty, but their action precisely tried to be as obvious as possible to receive the penalty.
They waited and gladly accepted the penalty.
Another issue is the type of benefit that offenders receive from the intentional mistakes examined.
Here it seems necessary to find that one does not put the opponent at a disadvantage and one does not get an advantage in the same match either, because obviously the result of the action implies leaving their own team with fewer players.
And it's not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club couldn't count on these players.
Obviously the advantage is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indeterminacy, because the team could be eliminated suddenly and apart from that, with this action the players complete a penalty match and move on to the second round of cards, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cards occurs with one less than in the first round.
So, climbing the stairs, it is not so clear that this is an advantage.
Ultimately, these actions are not contrary to the sporting spirit, of which strategic decisions are still part that promote the maximum benefit of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players did not act to avoid the application of the sanction (this would indeed be a clear case of fraud of the law),m otherwise they chose rather the moment in which they submitted to it.
They made a strategic decision without overriding the penalty or escaping it.
Although the line between genius and law fraud is wide, on this occasion I think we have had a clear case of genius.
The controversy, it seems to me, arises because of two factors: because there have been two self-expulsions and because of the way in which the director conveys them to provoke them.
The harm caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive offers to capture Christmas dinners for groups in BCN
The calendar dictatorship is concentrating an avalanche of reservations this year for days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-financed celebrations by employees who wish to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the bull and the lottery, when December arrives also come the dinners of groups before Christmas that continue to be the oxygen ball for restaurants and entertainment in Barcelona, but which due to the crisis have resulted in an offensive adjusted prices to be able to catch the majority customer: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinners and dinners.
To complete the complication of accounting, this year’s calendar (as New Year’s Eve falls Friday) concentrated requests in the week of December 13, resulting in an avalanche of dinner reservations for the peak days (the 17th and 17th) and almost nothing the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of the difficult times, there are many companies that have eliminated collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain the tradition, many employees organize them by paying out of their own pockets.
Whatever the situation, they all ask for battle prices, confirms the president of the Gremi de Restauraci<0xC3><0xB3> de Barcelona, Gaiet<0xC3><0xA0> Farr<0xC3><0xA0>s.
The representative of the employer, now, does not dare to predict how the holidays will be this month.
"People think a lot before booking."
“They want to go out, but they pay a lot of attention to the prizes,” he said.
The case will go well "for those who give quality at a good price and with a good service," he adds, and recalls that customers tend to descend a rung with the crisis, so that the slice around 25 euros has become the majority in demand.
In a survey in various establishments of the center we see the collapse of applications for the night of the 17th.
The Soteras group indicates that there is a real demand boom for that Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they responded by adapting their menus to the economy, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another of the most powerful group, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar assumed more early bookings, even from the beginning of November.
“We have done the impossible to maintain the same prices as last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros,” they detail.
AN Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 premises, remains optimistic after detecting an increase in invoicing since the second half and good, though concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources from the group mention that the 18th will also be a hyper-active day at the level of groups of friends who celebrate the holidays in advance.
To their six group menus they added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year instead of demanding more details, like Catalan wine made according to the Champagne method - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies inviting their employees again and the feeling that the volume of the groups has increased a little.
On behalf of the Fecasarm patronage (which includes entities such as the Barcelona Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment Association), its vice president, Enric Gom<0xC3><0xA0>, trusts in the possibility of starting to see the end of the tunnel and argues that overall bookings are "animated", even if customers "negotiate to the maximum".
This is true, the hope regarding the festivities has not fallen, no matter who pays, he says.
Pakistan's nuclear program raises major concerns in the United States
“Islamabad is producing nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country.”
Wikileaks leaks confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department filtered through the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns caused by the Pakistani nuclear program in Washington.
Apart from the enlightening and tasty details they offer on the content of the conversations and thoughts of North American diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal the fact that cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, instead of increasing, "decreases" and that the other unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "more than a rythm".
The peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - the fact that weapons are not assembled, but are stored in components to make their destruction difficult in the event of an attack - is one of the main concerns in Washington.
The ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, said in a report before the visit of former National Security Advisor James Jones: “The proximity of some of the territory’s nuclear facilities under attack by the Taliban, the dispersal of nuclear materials with short noise and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials.”
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is seen, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason to maintain guard.
"Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programs," said expert Yuri Korolev, from the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs.
The new documentation leaked by the Julian Assange portal is the ever-increasing cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and Pakistan’s high degree of nuclear weapons production.
An embassy dispatch in May, which described the communication with Pakistan as “frustrating,” said: “Transparency is often non-existent; offers of assistance remain unanswered or are eliminated.”
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a National Intelligence official for South Asia, notes that “despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world.”
Ambassador Patterson also asked Washington, during a visit by Army Chief General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it "very clear" to the official that "Pakistan's army must end its tacit support for terrorist groups."
Chasing the Wikileaks leader
Obama will count on a senior anti-terrorism official to avoid further infiltrations.
Interpol issues a red alert to track movements and locate Assange.
All aspects of Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated maze where it is difficult to be certain of the facts.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a “red alert” to “locate and track the movements” of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
In addition, this is not new, otherwise it dates from November 20.
And it has nothing to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter of a million U.S. diplomatic documents but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks’s creative lawyer, Mark Stephens, says that “the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange.”
The 20th international police force based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it did not make it public until yesterday, after receiving permission from the authorities of that country.
For example, the 188 countries of Interpol were instructed to identify or locate Assange "to obtain his provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot give the arrest order of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organization's explanations, consider the red notice call a free path for arrest -- which the national police force must carry out -- where they think they have a bilateral agreement on extradition, as well as an extradition case.
The movement outraged Assange’s lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing the fact that the founder of Wikileaks, 39, was willing to answer questions from the Swedish authorities via videoconference.
They also recall that Assange applied for and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which is compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of Stalin's security.
“This appears to be a hunt, not a legal persecution,” the letter said.
As the world searches for him – and in Australia his mother defends his son’s innocence – Assange continues to find himself in an unknown place, but he does not remain silent.
On Monday, he gave an indeterminate interview to the director of Time magazine via Skype, a conversation in which he called for the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“If it can be shown that she was responsible for giving orders to American graduates who are spying on the UN in violation of international treaties that the United States has signed, she should resign,” he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation request "ridiculous and absurd."
"I'm not at all sure why the opinion of a guy with a web page should interest us," he told CNN.
Obama himself has tasked a senior anti-terrorism official, Russell Travers, to prevent further leaks.
President Barack Obama’s attempt to reduce Assange’s importance contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators are proclaiming these days.
Peter King, the congressman who will chair the National Security Committee in the Lower House from January, has asked the State Department to consider including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations “to confiscate its funds and prosecute anyone who provides contributions or assistance to them.”
Even further went Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who had to return on his statements after saying that Assange would have to be "murdered".
"Obama should turn it into a target and use an unmanned plane or something like that."
One person who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"He who is in the government that leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything that is not an execution would be too kind a punishment," he told Fox.
Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s seeks peace in ERC with hints to Carod's followers
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s seems to have found the recipe to solve the next internal revolt inside ERC, without a north because of the loss of 11 deputies and half the votes.
The party president is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for the followers of former leader Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as his liar and that it can absolutely not give him headaches that he had with other currents.
This is why the leader of Esquerra will try to win his new critics with winks that allow him to arm himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisers will be able to comment on its continuity in secret.
By ballots, not by raising your hand.
If the carodists want to pass a certain penalty vote on the president, they will be able to do so without any fear of reprisals.
In fact, the leader of ranks wants to avoid the image of division and submission to his person.
In several interviews he stated that he would not consider himself ratified with half plus one of the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a "Bulgarian" result would not be good either.
People close to Carod demand the president a little more than making his position available to the militia, a gesture that is not worth it when Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s controls the maximum organ between congresses.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to approve a roadmap with the executive until May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the development of the strategic reorientation document that the management will submit to the National Council for a vote on the 18th.
His intention is to support Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s in exchange for his promise to schedule the congress for the fall of 2011, which the leaders consider to be a safe fact.
The ERC leader has confessed that "polyphony" affects stability and that its goal is to make the organization able to wash its household laundry once and for all.
In this line, the article that the current adviser Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the ideologue of Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s, the holder of Innovaci<0xC3><0xB3> thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" is as if it had been done.
And he listed five of them, of which he points out two.
The first, "recompose" the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the militants, that is, include new figures that come from the Carod-addicted sector.
The second may be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquid once and for all the assembly as a mechanism of operation.
Thus, he advocates a reform of the statutes that allows the realization of congresses through delegates elected by vote.
To end with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, was an obsession of the Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s team, which has already fought in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 conclave convulsion mandated management to revise the assembly model in a specific statute reform congress.
This meeting remains unfinished, as the internal tide of recent years did not recommend addressing this topic.
Now, without critical sectors on the lookout, the time might be good to take it back and shut it down forever.
23 executed in November; 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO of the State of Mexico, there was a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were executed in the state of Mexico, four fewer than the previous month, according to MILENIO of the state of Mexico.
Among the murders are those of three women and the discovery of two bodies cut in Valle de México.
During the last month of the year, 390 theoretical deaths related to organized crime were recorded.
Among the cases is that of a body found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitl<0xC3><0xA1>n, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three gunshots and the shot to the head, except for the feet and hands attached with a cable.
The next day, the body of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the trunk of an abandoned vehicle on Mixtecas Street in the Colonia Santa Cruz Acatl<0xC3><0xA1>n, in the municipality of Naucalpan.
Early Thursday morning, the four owners of jointly exploited land found a body with signs of torture and at least three lethal shots in the chest, on the highway near Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal, in the area that crosses the municipality of Villa Guerrero.
Near the body was found a message signed in theory by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later in Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yotl a 50-year-old gentleman was murdered with eight shots when he left his house to initiate the garbage collection works.
On November 7, two 30-year-old subjects were killed by a shot to the head each in the colony of San Pedro Xaloxtoc, municipality of Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the mercy shot in the front, the body of a man was found on a solitary road in Colonia El Naranjo and under the body was found a bullet punched with a .25 caliber firearm.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water channel of the Plaza Golondrina settlement.
The emergency services carried out a thorough search of the rest of the body members, but they were not found.
Residents of Tepotzotl<0xC3><0xA1>n warned of the discovery of a body in Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Colorada, hands tied behind and eyes blindfolded.
The man had an injury caused by a gunshot wound to his neck.
In the middle of the month, the execution of two men who had been wrapped in blankets and left in the trunk of a vehicle in the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda department in the municipality of Atizap<0xC3><0xA1>n in Zaragoza was reported, two death warning messages were discovered at the same time with the victims.
One day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony, the rest of the body was found wrapped in a black plastic bag with a message signed by L'Incorrigible.
On the 17th, wrapped in blankets, two women were found in the hamlet of Zoquiapan in the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the following morning the body of a man in Huixquilucan was located who had been wrapped in a yellow and blue blanket, being in principle identified with the name Mario R<0xC3><0xAD>os, agreed that he had agreed with the message.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunshots in the neck, the lifeless body of a woman was found in the hamlet of San Francisco Acuautla.
On the skin of the woman, tattoos of Santa Muerte and necklaces with her image were detected.
Towards the end of the month, the body of a man was found on the side of a car in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three shots and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men with their heads shorn and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies there was a message signed in principle by a criminal organization, which said: "This is what happens with those who do not align."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and with hands and feet attached, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the San Agust<0xC3><0xAD>n Colony Justice Center.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yotl.
The first of them had been beheaded in the Cuchilla Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n colony and had been wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with a cinnamon ribbon and a message next to it; while the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez.
Near him, the officers found a bristol with a message.
China Continues to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Targets
The representative of this country at COP16 assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and detailed that it maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent until 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country’s representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and reconvert its industry.
In fact, he said, over the past four years his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Nevertheless, he made clear that China will not change its objectives, but will continue to work together with the international community in this area.
He mentioned that China's climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building; and support for pilot programs.
Progress has been made in all these areas, including last year's approval of a new Energy Act, which recognizes the targets addressed in terms of greenhouse gas reduction, he said.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have worked in a coordinated manner with governments and local authorities to achieve energy-saving, energy-efficient and emission-reducing goals.
In addition, he said, there are various multi-annual plans underway or completed, both funded by the Chinese government and by the governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been implemented over the past five years and which has received investments from the United Nations (UN), government and private initiative.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another for the change of incandescent lamps by economical lamps and another for mitigation and adaptation, he detailed.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country’s government’s scientific advisor on climate change, said China’s efforts have been greater than is thought.
For example, he said, per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China are three tons per person, while in the United States they are 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historical contribution to pollution.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in energy use, how to increase energy efficiency by 20% in the last five years and plans to make another similar one around 2020, he said.
Legal Expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The National Leader of PAN detailed that the former Panist leader has the right to appeal to the National Order Commission to demand what is in law.
The national leader of PAN, César Nava V<0xC3><0xA1>zquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was legal and that the former Panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to demand what is legal.
In an interview prior to Gabino Cué Monteagudo's protest as governor of the state, he said that in any case, the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right to address, if necessary, by making a complaint to the Commission of Order of the National Council, so that this is a decision taken within a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he enlightened that this is not the time to think about 2012 and there has never been an alliance on the negotiating table for the presidential candidacy.
Nava V<0xC3><0xA1>zquez said he was convinced that Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n Nacional would be stronger after the internal elections on 4 and 5 December, where a successor should be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for the time being, it has been an approach for local elections that has been successful and has achieved its goal," he said.
The Panist leader mentioned that PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary, "we savour it and make ourselves stronger," he said.
He said that the council will probably know how to choose the best leader that Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n Nacional needs for the next three years, so he would give responsibility "to the person determined by the council."
"I am completely calm and open, I would be proud to leave the office of party president to any of the five."
He predicted that the party's resurgence in the July 4 elections will be reflected on the next dispute, although "this is not yet the time to think about 2012."
"At the moment it is about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emanate from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so there has been "a lot of hope for them, and I am sure Gabino will live up to expectations".
When asked about PRI’s criticism of President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n because of his speech during his four years in office, César Nava asked priests to reflect on the six years of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo y Salinas were better than those of Fox y Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n; let them start defending them; let them get out of 'the closet,'" he said.
He stated that the Federal Executive may make expressions like those he made in his speech in the National Auditorium, because in the country there is no censorship, let alone censorship.
Obama promotes Twitter law for undocumented students
"If you agree with the passage of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to pass this legislation," Trump tweeted on Twitter.
President Barack Obama met today at the National Mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his personal Twitter account.
“If you agree with the passage of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to pass this legislation,” Obama tweeted.
His short message maintains an open cyber link to a broader document that asks the public to contact senators immediately, as the vote on legislation is imminent.
“With a vote we hope to have soon, now is the time to listen to your voice,” he said.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote on any legislation if the extension of the Bush-era tax cuts and government funding continue.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other bills such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other bills, Presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he was confident that once the tax issue was resolved, an agenda could be set for the rest of the bills.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
“We all agree that this tax issue must be resolved before the end of the year.”
"I think we can get an agreement at some point and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would call for a "debate-closing vote" on the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on in the Senate starting next Thursday, even if the most likely would be next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Act would legalize 800,000 young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, they stayed in that country for the last five years and they were accepted by a higher education institution or by the Army.
But supporters require 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they require the support of a large number of Republicans, at times when pro-project organizations are actively lobbying to ensure approval of the Act.
Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
Nevertheless, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against and only one Republican expressed support for the bill, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
This is why supporters of the Dream Act require the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the most courteous Republicans are Senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and outgoing Senator George Lemieux, of Florida, who completed the mandate of Senator Mel Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they said they would not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined his stance so far.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the biggest hurdles to the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With literature we put our finger on the wound
The second stage of the Pleasures of the Language was a walk in which the participants showcased the narrative
"Sex in the tongue, I understand, but... the finger on the wound? what do you expect from me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of the Pleasures of the language, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and that this time used the subtitle of his question in the language of faith.
The finger on the wound "... puts us in an embarrassment", gently threw the Argentine writer to the public, most of the young people, who had gathered at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this table moderated by Marisol Shultz and in which participated Monte Garultz and Valenzuela, May, and Sergio Ram<0xC3><0xAD>za.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz defined after as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who seeks to know what is the "wound", she goes from one doctor to another, without getting an answer, only clues in the same narrative thread.
From the infectiologist she comes out convinced: "Patience is not my strength, maybe it is my wound".
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who cut his breath in the middle of the corridor, but who explains to him that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is what is open in reality, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighed with relief and concluded: "On the wound I could only know that it is open in reality and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and the traps of the tongue must be very linked.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez also exhibited a delightful narration that he titled Praise to the Invention, where the finger on the wound is not named but at some point is discovered.
With touches of magical realism, he speaks of a famous sorceress who touched the clouds, brought back people who had gone away or repaired virtues that a lady had lost, a narrative that goes to speak later America, the great news that has had from the beginning of his own chroniclers D<0xC3><0xAD>al and quotes from Bern.
"Cervantes, who invented us all, mocked the false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but in a way we would never have told the history of America with an imagination that lacked even modesty."
Nevertheless, he pointed out, "madmen and liars have the best imagination" and here reality converges with lies, it is no longer known what part of the narrative belongs to one band or another, where fiction literature reaches its peak.
This is actually called the “Tradition of Cervantes”.
“It’s because of your legacy that you are what you tell.”
In turn, the writer Mayra Montyero annotated and applauded the variety of interpretations provoked by the invitation of the FIL with its round table The Debt on the Wound.
The Puerto Rican Cuban has put her foot on the great plague of social violence that her country is going through – and Latin America shares – produces drug trafficking and sales disputes.
"I think that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that is not, of course, premeditated," she said, after citing that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the commitment that is established between the author and the readers, and that it is a last "chemical reaction" of this.
The evening ended with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a Montero who also stressed "it owes on the wound of the writer engaged".
He considered that in a world that also lives at high speed in terms of intellectual habits and the control of consciousness that turns to the advantage of dogmatisms, "behind every affirmation there is a small no and behind every denial there is a small yes".
"To be the masters of our own feelings and to be the masters of reality, we must nuance: and nuance means many times to put our finger on the wound and disturb people who feel very comfortable thinking in caricature, in white and black, in established ideas and without nuance and also to disturb the powers who prefer to noir," he said.
Romano on the hunt for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has had three defeats in the finals he has had ups and downs in his career, but he managed to reach three times the decisive series.
With the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are also two different styles that confront each other, marked by their technicians, who find a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has had three defeats in the finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has managed to reach three times the decisive series, although so far he has not put in the thousand and that is why this opportunity is very special for him.
The Argentinian ended up consoling himself with the subchampion medal, he remained one step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive finals.
The santist strategist reached his first final as a coach in the 2002 Opening Tournament, when he held the reins of Morelia with which he lost with a 4-2 overall result against Toluca; subsequently, in the 2003 Closing he also reached the decisive duel and this was against Ray again with the 1-3 overall result.
With Santos Laguna already, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, again against the Diablos, Rubén suffered again a setback, as his team made an equal match of 2-2 against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the series of penalties he got an advantage for 3-1 with two goals with two opportunities to get the title and finally he scored 11 of 3 games.
Rubén lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his rival in the tournament, therefore he does not want to have the same fate, he tries to detach himself from the evil in order to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, even if he claims that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, not for a passion that I have and therefore I will get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," said the driver when asked what his weaknesses would be in the finals.
He remembers a lot of the last final, from which he assures that he has learned a lot, "the only lesson we can remember is that until the referee whistles the final, we can't celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players too, because the last time, with two penalties to shoot, we can't cross the already prepared to run".
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which does not worry him, because he entrusts to his players: "We never try to get to the series of penalties, we try to finish in the regular time, but sometimes we only have to prepare, the previous tournament we have prepared, sometimes the hand has made us, unfortunately the hand is the hand
Romano now has the opportunity to no longer be a sub-champion technician and taste for the first time the glory offered by the titles.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining a visa
Individuals must go to the Visa Applicants Service Centers before their interview in the Consular Section; the cost of waiting time will be reduced.
As of January 10, 2011, the visa processing procedure at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates will change.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants will be required to report to the Visa Applicant Service Centres (ASCs) prior to their interview in the Consular Section.
CSA staff will take biometric information from the applicant, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have some benefits for applicants, including the following:
The total cost to process the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to get an appointment, another payment for the visa processing and another for the mail service to deliver the document.
The applicant will make a single payment covering all three services.
The current tariff will remain the same: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas with demand (this includes visas for temporary workers) and $390 for merchant and investor visas.
Individuals wishing to renew their visa will not be required to present themselves for an interview with the Consular Representative, they will only present themselves at the nearest CSA where they will present the documents and take their fingerprints.
Due to the fact that the biometric information will be taken from the CSA, applicants who wish a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain there for less time than before.
Similarly, visa applicants at the Consulates of Ciudad Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the $26 extra service fee.

NASA announces discovery of extraterrestrial life
The U.S. space agency cited the press to present tomorrow a discovery that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will release an astrobiological discovery on Thursday that could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference tomorrow Thursday at 13:00 at NASA headquarters in Washington for experts in astrobiology, the science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
When she quoted the press, NASA assured that it would present who will have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life," which has sparked speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us and in hostile environments that were thought to be uninhabited and would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if their living conditions are improved.
It seems that we are talking about a microbe discovered at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, that lives in an environment that was thought to be too poisonous for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
In any form, the creature uses arsenic as a way of life and this ability makes us think that similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our volunteer atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know".
The space agency will communicate the true scope of the findings in tomorrow's press conference, Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn’s largest satellite), with the perspective that its chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Germe PRD, PT, Convergence and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n 'block' opposing
With reforms to the Organic Law of the Congress, the arrival of "bipartisanism" is possible, it is denounced.
The 60th had just settled when an opposition bloc appeared in the Congress led by the deputies of PRD, PT, Convergence and Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Manuel Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo, who declared themselves independent and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartisanism' in the Chambers.
Before initiating the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, of Convergence; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of PRD; and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo, 'tunned' against the reform of the Organic Law, because it excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, we initiate "bipartisanism" because now there are two people, from the same number of parties, who control the Congress.
These four MEPs, alongside Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only ones to vote against the Board chaired by PANist Salvador L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Brito and Luis Antonio C<0xC3><0xA1>rdenas Fonseca, as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that these institutional reforms constitute the political marginality on the part of PRI and PAN.
He mentioned that in the following days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme starting from a political will and if they did not, they would be enslaved again by both parties and in this way will end the opposing coalition.
"So far it has come (the opposing coalition), that's what I'm looking at, because we're excluded from any decision, they don't even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez of Convergence mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n there are coincidences and that is why they form a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that the Congress, having been monopolistic, is now "duopolitical".
"It is not the spirit of law reform that there is eternal bipartisanship in Congress."
To begin with, this group starts with 5 legislators and they are now talking to other colleagues to make them more numerous, the Convergent abounded.
PT’s Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza explained that now Congress has turned into a ‘butin’ between the two, alluding to PAN and PRI.
“Before there was only one party, now they divide it between two.”
Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo asked to respect the personality of the member, to give him his place at the negotiating tables.
"That they do not leave by cupular agreements out of 5 which will probably be 9 MPs, now the five that we see, separated in different factions, we have decided to unite to seek a place in the negotiating table, that is the problem, that in the reform that they have made, that they have decided, we are out and we are not reforming".
$200 million more for "supplier"
The City of Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n pays another cheque to the questioned owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another cheque of about 200 miles pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Hall.
With it, the amount paid this second semester to the owner of the electrical equipment company amounts to 1 million 200 miles pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipality, this last check number 9258447 was issued on November 16 for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, in concept of "suppliers account liquidation".
Treasurer Luis Miguel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Moreno had said that the Commune would pay additional amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the State Supreme Audit to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total of the debt and, therefore, how many cheques will still be issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
"We didn't buy anything, we just pay him what we owe him, just like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: on 24 September, two on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the latter on 16 November.
Although the provider has not yet published in the Official Journal of the State, according to the provisions of the Act when a business is questioned by ASE, to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer has assured that they have not used its services again.
All this, after July 25, Noroeste had published a revision of the cheques that the City Hall issues to its suppliers, revealing that in the interval March 2008 - July 2010, in the triennium of Mayor Jorge Abel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, the Municipality paid Camacho Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos, through 42 cheques.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, collecting cheques of more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites need to be taken care of
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to the poor conditions of the S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Taboada roundabout in Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n.
After a foreign tourist fell into a hollow of the S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Taboada roundabout, the Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n tourism sector asked authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in poor conditions and project a poor image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Zona Dorada Merchants Association, recalled that they have repeatedly requested that the image of the destination be taken care of and new activities should replace others that tourists find bad.
He said the poor state of the streets and sidewalks has affected as tourists come to walk there and they see the mess and avoid nearby shops.
"Politicians don't know what it means to close a business one day and they don't know the fortune you lose, elsewhere they didn't do the work for so long and without proper planning."
The hotelier José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance on the part of the City Hall.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do it, so through a preventive interview and only make the correction," he said.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because this is a tourist area must be maintained, but as residents who deserve a clean place to live there and the City Hall must change its strategy to maintain the city well."
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it depends only on the promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleanliness in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
"They have not been given the attention they need, and this kind of fact highlights something that is notorious for everyone, the interview is necessary."
Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Llera Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez, under secretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the recovery of Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n tourist sites is urgent, as they are not used properly and project a bad image.
He talked about a series of places that need to come together with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up-to-date, clean, orderly and attractive as it has a tourist vocation.
“Happily Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n offers a lot of historical and cultural sites and places that we should order first, clean up and put online to make them attractive so we can add them to the inventory we have to promote this destination.”
IP calls for results in Congress
Eduardo D<0xC3><0xA1>valos, President of CCE, proposed that MEPs take on the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations it faces.
The Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n business sector is calling for a dignified and free-of-agreement Labour Legislature between the parties and the Government Executive, as Sinaloa is convulsed and facing major problems.
Yesterday the 60th legislature was established, consisting of seven political forces, 19 MPs from PRI, 13 from PAN, three from the New Alliance Party, two from PRD, one from PT, one from Convergencia and one from PVEM, a total of 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectations that the new members of the Government Congress is a clean and committed management with society and the different sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of party spirit or paternalism do not repeat.
Eduardo D<0xC3><0xA1>valos, President of CCE, proposed that MEPs take on the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations it faces.
"We hope that MPs actually exercise their right, free of agreements between the parties because the custom is that they make pacts to safeguard their own interests and they turn into a carnival masquerade of governors and leaders of parliamentary factions."
That is why I ask that they certify the commitment to build the necessary bridges that make the current Governor progress.
“We will make sure they do a decent and above all committed job with society and sectors because the people of Sinaloa gave them their vote of confidence in the past elections.
José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, president of the Association of Hotels Tres Islas, considered that one of the great provocations of the 40 representatives of the people is to push and add forces in search of the economic growth of the state, because now the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure and this will in a way stimulate the generation of jobs."
With regard to tourism, he requested that the new legislators give it the importance it has in the government budget to consolidate the Government Tourism Secretariat.
"I understood that this is the second Secretariat of the State with a smaller budget and it is incongruous as an important economic activity that generates currency and investment and that competes directly with the agro-industry."
Apart from the fact that resources must be classified as detonating tourism projects that help provide security to the State and update the Alcohol Act that previous legislatures have not been able to resolve.
We are looking for a king mage.
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next day of the Magi will be difficult to fulfill their illusions, because their home is formed by no more and no less than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s, José Alfredo, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe, Isa<0xC3><0xAD>as, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will wear the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house in Colonia Salvador Allende and they live day to day because their father does not have a stable job.
"Sometimes it's very difficult for us, because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell tangerines and potatoes... and in the afternoon I go out with the 'pl<0xC3><0xAA>bes' to sell on the street," says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaida, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bike, and her sister Isabel, 3 years old, would like a Barbie doll.
In turn, 10-year-old José Alfredo has long aspired to have a 'monster truck' and for his 8-month-old brother Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s, Cayetana suggests sized clothes for a year.
"He said to me (José Alfredo), 'I'd like to have this monster,' but I said to him 'we'll see, my son,' because he was very dear," recalls with sadness Cayetana.
For older children, who was at school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe, 11, wears size 12; Isa<0xC3><0xAD>as, 10, wears size 10, while Miguel, 8, wears size 8.
Jose Juan, 14, needs a pair of sports shoes, so a pair of size five and a half or six would help him a lot.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true you can participate in the campaign On Seeking King Mage, giving a toy or money to the reception of Noroeste.
Fourteen suspected drug traffickers arrested
A dozen searches were carried out in Estrie on Wednesday as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The raids took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that would have been used for drug production.
“About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment used for production were seized,” said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a spokesman for the S<0xC3><0xBB>reté du Québec.
A total of 11 men and three women were arrested, including the two alleged leaders of this network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons were to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face charges of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These searches took place as a result of a long-running investigation, which lasted almost a year.
"It is information received from the public that allowed us to proceed with these arrests," Ruel said.
Some 70 police officers from the Estrie de la S<0xC3><0xBB>reté du Québec regional investigation module, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphremagog Police Department took part in this police operation.
Illegal migration can continue without problems
The Conservatives' bill, which the government says should solve the problem of boats carrying illegal migrants, is clearly going to be defeated as the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I strongly support the Charter."
“I stand with a party that created the granite under your feet,” Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff said as he was surrounded by MPs after the weekly caucus meeting.
The Liberals claim that the proposed bill, which would allow for up to one year of detention of any person from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the Bloc Québécois, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill, because he is dealing with the wrong target.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will see what the government will do," Duceppe said.
NDP immigration critic Olivia Chow has backtracked on criticism that her party is not firm enough about illegal immigrants.
“The New Democrats agree to take action against smugglers, and that is what we are doing through another bill, the C-35,” Chow said.
“We don’t support the Conservative bill because it takes on refugees and jails children for at least a year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
“Canadians are telling MPs massively that they don’t tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country like a gag.”
"They expect Canada to take firm action," Minister Kenney said.
The government did not announce a vote of confidence in its bill, which could have led the country to an election that it rejected.
A Conservative, however, told the QMI that the government was going to ask for a vote so that each MP who opposes would then explain himself to his constituents.
The new unit does not make unanimity
Despite Jean Charest's announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion, many observers continue to call for the creation of a public inquiry commission on the subject.
The Minister of Public Safety, Robert Dutil, argues that this idea does not date back to yesterday: Quebec would have consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue as early as January last year.
The metropolis has had a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
Tuesday’s announcement came as a surprise to more than one.
It must be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on Quebec Police Services on October 29, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It was no longer necessary for Beijing’s public safety critic, Stéphane Bergeron, to call this announcement a “bunny out of a hat” and a “do-it-yourself solution on the corner of a table.”
Minister Dutil has responded to those who fear that political power will have too much influence on the possible future unity.
“You’ll see the result when we announce it, he’s just saying it.”
“We are aware of this problem.”
For CSQ President Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public inquiry.
“The more Mr. Charest stubbornly refuses to create this commission of inquiry, the more people like you and me think he has something to hide,” he said.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest," says Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the <0xC3><0x89>cole nationale d'administration publique.
To get out of this impasse, he therefore suggests that Quebec give a special mandate to the Auditor General to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Auditor General," he said.
He also believes that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a commissioner, allowing him to compel people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in the Charest government.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code in order to be better suited to this type of crime.
This request would come from the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisprudence is not explicit in such investigations.
Federal Minister of Public Safety, Vic Toews, confirmed that his Justice colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently considering certain amendments related to this matter.
During Operation Spring 2001, which targeted groups of motorcyclists, although the Criminal Code was not adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently passed the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under high surveillance
Several streams remain under high surveillance due to heavy rainfall that has hit several parts of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred on Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two houses were evacuated in a preventive manner.
In the evening, another slip occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
A road has collapsed.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall fell on several regions, from 40 to 70 millimeters of rain.
An additional 20 to 40 millimeters of rain was expected by Thursday evening, depending on the regions.
The areas north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimeters of rain in total.
As these precipitations must be added to the melting of snow already accumulated in some sectors, there is fear of overflow of several streams.
Flood warning warnings were issued Wednesday evening by the Civil Security of Quebec for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
The rivers of the North, in Saint-Jér<0xC3><0xB4>me, in the Laurentians, and of the Oak, in Lotbini<0xC3><0xA8>re, were the subject of flood watch and remained under surveillance.
In the Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re region, heavy rainfall led to the overflow of certain lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was taken away due to heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Ottawa, the overflow of some lakes has led to the closure of several roads, notably in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Civil Security remains on high alert and is closely monitoring the situation, said security adviser Annik Bouchard.
The Quebec Flood Forecast Centre issued flood warnings for several rivers on Wednesday, including Maskinongé, L'Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and the Wolf.
Dupont partially blamed
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback in front of the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Council (CCNR) for controversial remarks about social assistance and Haitians as well as his rude language on the air.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his team at CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but that some of the comments contained "inaccurate information about social assistance, unduly negative representations of Haitians and rude language that is not suitable for broadcasts during the day".
The Commission also concluded that a discussion on suicide, including the dissemination of the names of two persons who had committed suicide, did not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CBSC had received several complaints about comments made during broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint from the Joint Front of Socially Assisted Persons of Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts quoted in the show were inaccurate.
Animators must present solid information rather than misleading.
Regarding suicide, the facilitator Stéphane Dupont had considered that suicide is a cowardly gesture.
The majority of Committee members concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life's problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes of 'Dupont at Noon' have addressed a sensitive subject fairly and appropriately."
No blame was taken in his place.
The latest litigation focused on statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort then engaged in a media face-to-face that had provoked a lot of reactions.
The CHOI facilitator said he had made no donations to help Haitians because it could not be known with certainty that people in need would really receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constituted an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already served my three-day suspension on it."
"My file has been blank for a year and a half," the host said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the spread of rude language.
In each case, the broadcaster CHOI-FM collaborated "beyond its obligation".
The consequences are minimal for the station, which will, among other things, have to announce these decisions once during the hours of great listening within three days.
A King of Kung-Fu in Montreal
The Montréal native of Algeria Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely special course.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing climbs the world's tatamis and rings in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts such as kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria," said Zemmal, who has been in the metropolis since 2008 to evolve among professionals.
“In my case, I’m looking for fights a little bit everywhere, because for those who don’t like the mixed martial arts ground game, competitions are rare in North America.”
Recently, he who works as a security agent and as a comrade for the company UPS has just issued bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Amateur Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Championship, from October 23 to 30, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
“I won the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing,” he explained.
"Currently, I am preparing to go to China for the San Shou World Cup."
"The fighters who finished in the top four at the last World Championship in each category were invited."
"I won the bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, while I finished third in Toronto in 2009, he added."
"What's interesting is that I've progressed at every competition."
"At this rate, I'll be first this time or next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China where punches and kicks, as well as projections on the ground, are allowed.
The duels originally take place on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most famous boxer from this form of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well known in the martial arts world.
If Nacer Zemmal has only one event to remember in his career, he will surely respond to his presence at the super tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China," explained the friendly guy.
"It's a bit the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first fight, in the semi-final of his category (80 kg), before losing in the final.
"The one who beat me was a real pro," he said.
"There are four fighters per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals compete in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category face off in order to crown a single champion, the king of kung-fu."
450 million in contracts without calls for tenders
Hydro-Québec has voluntarily awarded $450 million in contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium formed by the firms BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor that has obtained the most important, that of the management of the project, for a sum of 295 million dollars without a call for tenders.
This consortium, called Energie gérance, was established in 2004 in conjunction with Hydro-Québec's decision to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Management Consortium was awarded the lucrative contract without a public call for tenders.
For the Parti Québécois, the use of business consortia poses a serious ethical problem that risks eliminating competition and causing prices to rise.
“It’s the new way to collude and knock down competition.”
"In other words, people, instead of doing it in secret, are now doing it openly," Beijing MP Sylvain Simard told a news conference yesterday.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because he says it is difficult to see how the public interest can be served in this way.
Natural Resources Minister Nathalie Normandeau responded in the afternoon, strongly denying that there was collusion for the contract.
“I’m starting to have my journey,” she said, arguing that the PQ had been “dishonest” and “lack of rigor.”
She said that "it would be the least of things" that the PQ apologizes.
Consortium formula is a common practice around the world.
This is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their respective expertise in order to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity given the scale of the work.
The project is underway and is scheduled to run until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without the game of competition acting; there was negotiation.
Thus, the consortia formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the formula of consortia in the consulting engineering sector is being investigated by the government.
A quick overview of the Quebec business register allows to count more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
Thus, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and others Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens, leads back to one and the same legal person, or Dessau.
As for the Energy Management consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the James Bay Territory responds to particular labour dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has responded in a particular way since the 1970s".
Eastmain's chief executive, Réal Laporte, of the James Bay Energy Society (SEBJ), gave an explanation that glared at the fact that the project's management contract was granted on a voluntary basis.
“If you go bidding and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher.”
"You have two choices: either you take the people who are in that market and you say, 'We're going to negotiate a satisfactory deal with a good price.'"
"But the idea is that it's not the price that matters, it's people's competence," Laporte said.
This contract awarded to the Energy Management consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After auditing, Le Devoir counted 109 consulting engineering contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has won 22 contracts, Génivar has won 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not including its participation in Energy Management.
All contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the Energy Management contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four firms that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau has hinted that the PQ is also linked to those firms that "finance" it, before specifying that they were rather its leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer - The "green" label does not inspire confidence
More green, but frankly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in sustainable development actors, but also in fair brands and green certifications to guide his choices.
Alas, even if it bathes in a media universe where messages in favor of more responsible consumption are plentiful, it deplores a lack of credible information, a deficiency that it even qualifies as a brake on its commitment, says the Barometer of Responsible Consumption, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Although they increased the consumption of so-called socially responsible products in 2010, Quebecers seem to be giving very little credit to those trying to sell them.
Two-thirds of them say they do not believe in the environmental commitment of companies as well as the green advertising of companies, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatory of Responsible Consumption of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certifications on so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands that show themselves to be environmentally responsible, says the Barometer.
In the same vein, the speech of politicians on this topic is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
Information on responsible consumption, however, seems essential to boost this part of consumption currently driven by almost a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and dubious nature of information would calm the cravings of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
In addition, a third of Quebecers say they are as distrustful of the alleged performance of green products or services as they are trying to put in their hands.
On another note, consumers were nearly half in 2010 to have changed their habit and above all changed the brand of one or more products to meet their conviction.
At 61%, they also favored shopping with merchants in their neighborhood and preferred the purchase of food products grown in their area, the Barometer said.
Greener and more responsible - the Responsible Consumption Index has reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year - , the Homo consumus du Québec likes to present itself as the king of recycling who seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by caring about animal protection.
But his social and ecological awareness seems to remain outside his car, the Barometer says: in 2010, barely 28% of Quebecers indicated that they had used public transport or advocated carpooling to defend their green interests.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this extensive behavioral survey, which has just taken its first snapshot.
A State Loan for the Acquisition of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to commit itself financially to the purchase of the eXcentris film complex by Société Angus et le Parallele, agrees to cooperate, but only with a loan.
The Angus Development Society and the Parallel, which hoped for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris film complex on Boulevard Saint-Laurent by giving him his full cinematic vocation, did not get what they demanded.
The government agrees to be involved in the matter, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the Government of Quebec is proposing a loan that would be lower than initial expectations, which could be a viable solution under favourable conditions, at least in the opinion of sources from government offices.
A first action plan and a demand of $12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the demands have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and an action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Macerola, who manages the eXcentris file.
He sent him a final report about ten days ago.
But the cabinet’s counter-proposal came to SODEC on Tuesday.
Parallel and Angus have until December 31 to respond.
It seems, however, that the hypothesis of the gift of the state really needs to be ruled out.
Recall that the Association des proprieteurs de cinemas et de cinemaparcs du Québec opposed a direct investment by the state to support the purchase of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture did not have to finance real estate projects, which it did not do for other cinemas.
On the contrary, several stakeholders in the environment called for substantial economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the master of céans, for ten years carried the author’s cinema in his premises of the complex after financing its construction himself, which could justify a derogation from the Treasury Board.
The lack of venues for independent films is screaming in Montreal, and eXcentris had managed to retain its clientele.
The Angus Corporation and the Parallel, led by Christian Yaccarini, are running a private funding campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to drive the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one of the three screens, Le Parallele, continues to broadcast films to eXcentris.
The goal of the future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on February 27th by screening the very beautiful film by Xavier Beauvois Des hommes et des gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not recall Le Devoir and we do not know what he and his group think of the proposals that are made to them.
The veil lifted over a complex Canada...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks lift the veil on what the U.S. considers to be the inferiority complex of Canadians to Americans, but they also betray their sense of superiority to Canada.
Thus, U.S. diplomats are surprised that every Canadian voter does not have Canadian-American relations in mind by going to vote and believe that President Obama’s visit helped the Conservative government pass its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, spread on the public square yesterday, offer more crunchy details than substantial content to get under the teeth.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, in the midst of a federal election campaign, recounts how much the United States is not part of the issues discussed by political leaders.
To the astonishment of the U.S. Ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations for this situation.
“A near-inherent Canadian inferiority complex may condition Canadian political leaders to talk about everyday domestic issues rather than drag this election onto the United States (as in the 1988 free trade campaign),” he writes.
The United States is therefore, he concludes, “the proverbial elephant of this election: ubiquitous, but potentially too threatening to speak of.”
The ambassador understands even less this "deafening silence" as the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
“Logically, the ability of a candidate, a party and even more of a party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind when going to vote.”
The other expression of this sense of importance is in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, in charge of business in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“Your trip will help ensure the government’s survival in the federal budget confidence vote in early February, by which Canada will post its first deficit in more than a decade due to a $30-$40 billion stimulus plan,” Breese wrote.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to prolong parliament before Christmas to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and that opposition parties made its survival conditional on the quality of the proposed stimulus plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that the drama series aired on CBC are referring to the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about the Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O shows, in which there are subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or the CIA's muscular interrogation kidnappings.
Another cable reports that, during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to welcome some Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner said yes, but on a case-by-case basis.
At the end of the meeting, he wrote, "he handed over a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The secretary has agreed to review the file."
Finally, let’s note that the spirits are warming up regarding the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "murdered".
He echoed Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A Global Plan to Renovate Lighting
The United Nations has proposed in Cancun a plan to renovate domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to achieve a greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction that is nearly one-third of the additional reduction needed to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is in line with the major concrete projects that the United Nations hopes to have adopted in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments by the industrialized countries.
According to the plan tabled yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs that still monopolize 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by fluo-compact bulbs or, better yet, by light-emitting diode bulbs (DEL or "LED" in English), the bulk of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GHG emitted would be human.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the global fleet’s emissions.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitting countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that are expected to increase global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to subtract another 5 Gt from this balance sheet in order to stabilise the climate increase to 2 degrees Celsius by 2020 in order to prevent it from becoming out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat and the rest, or 5%, is produced by light.
With fluo-compact bulbs, the energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, this energy requirement is reduced twice more.
Fluocompact bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week - the company also participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, giving an idea of the possible economy with a country-wide replacement plan that applies.
These brand new bulbs can also work with rheostats in addition to emitting very little heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
A number of experts have made reservations about compact fluorescent bulbs as they contain mercury and should be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers put in place guidelines.
But, the report says, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the fluo-compact bulb, but rather coal-fired thermal power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce wasted electricity in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the gains that each country would make through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save one billion dollars a year in electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost it 2.5 billion.
C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire is anxious to announce election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for the publication of the results of the presidential election in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire "without delay" after the deadlines had expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results without further delay," a spokesman for the UN chief said.
"It calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to show responsibility and refrain from any initiative until provisional results are announced."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the election commission missed Wednesday’s midnight deadline without publishing the results, three days after Sunday’s vote.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the CIS president told television that the commission was "continuing to work" to announce the results.
Calls have increased around the world on Wednesday for the CIS to finally announce the name of the winner of the second round between outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But Camp Gbagbo is counting on the Constitutional Council’s cancellation of “fraudulent” votes in the north, held by the former New Forces (NF) rebellion since the failed coup d’état of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign manager of the Ivorian president, said the intimidation of voters by the UN in the north of the country had deterred supporters of the outgoing president from going to vote.
The entire election could be cancelled if Gbagbo's complaints are retained by the Constitutional Council.
Gbagbo's opponents believe the country's highest court is not neutral as it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dre, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a Northern man who denies any link to the former rebels, found the delay in announcing the results "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go as far as claiming victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and that complaining to the Constitutional Council, after preventing the election commission from disseminating the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential election, on Sunday, was supposed to crown the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that remained divided into two for years.
The United Nations warned the Ivorian political class on Wednesday that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished in the first round on October 31, with 38% of the vote against 32% in Alassane Ouattara, which received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment remained stable in France in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France within the meaning of the International Labour Office (ILO) remained stable at 9.3% in the metropolis (9.7% counting the overseas departments), according to the provisional seasonally adjusted data (CVS) published by the INSEE on Thursday.
The number of unemployed stands at 2.631 million in the metropolis.
The data for the second quarter were confirmed at 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7% with the DOMs.
Over a year, the unemployment rate is up by 0.1 percentage points.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they were available within two weeks to work and whether or not they were looking for a job.
The situation of young people in the labour market has further deteriorated, with a further increase in the unemployment rate, brought to 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 points over three months, + 0.5 points over one year) and 25% including the DOMs.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed within the meaning of the ILO.
Seniors, for their part, experienced a slight increase in unemployment, to 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 points over three months and over one year), i.e. 482,000 people aged 50 or over, and 6.6% with the DOMs.
Only the 25-49-year-olds benefited from a stability of unemployment in the third quarter, at 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 points over three months, +0.1 points over one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
The INSEE no longer publishes monthly unemployment rates since 2006, after a controversy over its method of calculation.
Eurostat, the European Union's statistics agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a 9.8% rate for France (DOM included) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini questioned and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of waste treatment companies and brother of the PS president of the Bouches-du-Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne General Council, was put on trial and beheaded at the detention center in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into alleged fraudulent public procurement.
Alexandre Guérini has been put on trial for abuse of social property, embezzlement of funds and public property, embezzlement, active corruption, trafficking of influence and possession of ammunition, his lawyer said.
"Alexandre Guerini is combative and wants to explain himself on all the questions that the magistrate will ask him, not fantasies."
“It’s easy to sue him for a multitude of reprehensible leaders, it’s another thing to prove them,” his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before his client’s hearing.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the PS strongman in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, asked, through his lawyers, to pass to the judge before his hearing a memo in order to explain himself.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also put on trial Wednesday night and stunned.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, his client never did anything but run the landfills he had to manage.
As for the award of contracts or the use of funds related to their operation, he was never aware of it, Mr Simon said.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former director general of services of the Aubagne agglomeration, was put on trial on Wednesday for misappropriation of public funds and complicity, and left free under judicial control with a ban on meeting the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to provide explanations for the facts he is accused of."
"The instructing magistrate took this into account by not depriving him of his freedom," said his lawyer, Me Yann Arnoux.
Four other people had been questioned and released in the night from Tuesday to Wednesday, with placement under judicial scrutiny for two of them, Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic Michel Raffin said.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy general director of cleanliness of Marseille Provence Metropolis (MPM), is being prosecuted for "trafficking of influence and passive corruption".
Two officials of the Aubagne agglomeration, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are being questioned, one for "subtraction and diversion of public goods by a person in charge of a public service mission", the other for "complicity of diversion of public funds".
Finally, Alexandre Guérini's companion, Jeannie Peretti, was put on trial for "reselling abuse of social property".
Among the people who confronted Mr. Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who recently stumbled into a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement in Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies have been used to launder money from the great banditry.
The investigation is being conducted as part of several judicial information opened against X in April 2009 following anonymous letters, for alleged fraud in the procurement of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
A source close to the investigation, the investigations focus in particular on the conditions for the allocation and operation of a landfill of La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne as well as from certain cities of the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: the Elysée has exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "espionage", kept opinion in France in check, put diplomacy on alert, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of U.S. diplomats.
The US documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some of the undersides of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans, even giving them advice for dealing with their own “hostage” crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials sought to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchwoman had not been in return for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and wanted by the US court for trafficking in materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they put under a rough light the way the French presidency sought to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
In reality, it was nothing.
A diplomatic telegram written on August 12, 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to handle hostage cases".
The Elysée’s advisor for strategic affairs, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d’Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, meet with US diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise the Americans to do the same to repatriate their own nationals forcibly detained in Iran.
"Made of noise," they say, "martyr constantly" in the media the words "fundamental human rights", "innocence", "immediate release".
It is necessary in order to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
“Do it all the more as the Iranians ask you not to do it.”
Because, having passed the attempts of discussions through discreet channels, "silence will not solve anything", the Iranians are "masters in delaying maneuvers".
Richier added that the arrest of foreigners is "a familiar Iranian tactic: taking hostages for political blackmail."
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss (who will intervene on August 16, the day she takes refuge at the French embassy) "will require the payment to the Iranians of a large sum of money" (230,000 euros of bail).
And he says that the Elysée anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will get worse".
The Iranians could “in the near future arrest another of the 1,800 French citizens living in Iran,” he said.
August 28, 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been released from prison for 12 days, but remains stranded in Iran.
Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose U.S. demands extradition for illegal trafficking of sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, has been released in Paris on the order of a judge.
The U.S. Embassy, like many observers, wonders about this troubling coincidence.
For Washington, which tracks Iran’s clandestine networks for the acquisition of nuclear program equipment, the expansion of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Did France accept a bargain?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the French?
In a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier says that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he said, was not only “completely taken by surprise by the judge’s decision,” but sought to oppose it.
"There was a lively exchange between the French presidency and the guard of the seals" (at the time, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Marie), but "the French government can not return on the decision" judicial, he observes.
Mr. Richier also wanted to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remained under the "close" surveillance of the French intelligence services.
The adviser of the Elysee composes a phone number, hangs up, and then informs the US diplomat that the Iranian "is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy".
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not spare its efforts, through press releases and “leaks” organized in the media, to make it appear that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad plays an “important” and “influential” role as a “mediator”.
Americans observe this activity not without irony, and find that the manipulation bears its fruit since several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 evokes "the media 'blitz' of French officials".
What is the basis of so much "gratitude" expressed to Mr Assad, asks the embassy in Paris.
“Despite their praiseworthy statements, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have actually done.”
The paper then looks at the reasons that prompted the Elysée to pour into this fiction.
The intense communication effort "is aimed at validating Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria," he said.
A policy launched in 2008, which had then been perceived, by many critical voices in France and abroad, as premature and undeserved.
By "exaggerating the Syrian role," Paris seeks to "demonstrate to Syria what praise it can attract by playing a constructive role in the region."
The goal is also to “sow seeds of discord between Syria and Iran.”
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a good source.
On 11 August, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier told him: “Of course, we don’t know if the Syrians did anything.”
"But we thanked them anyway."
“This should at least cause confusion among the Iranians.”
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy welcomes her to the Elysée.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and Syria for their "active role in favor of the liberation of our compatriot".
No online games for young Koreans last midnight
The South Korean government will pass a so-called "Cinderella" law that will ban teens from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
A bill will be submitted to parliament in December to ask online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight for young people under the age of 16, representatives from the ministries of culture and family said.
“A lot of kids play these games all night and then have difficulty studying at school and having a normal life during the day.”
"We believe that this law is necessary to guarantee their health and their right to sleep," Jo Rin, the minister in charge of the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be available again at 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for law enforcement, he said.
The government is also considering asking companies to limit the daily access time to these games for young people whose parents request it, the official added.
It will also make available to people who demand it free software that allows you to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report various facts related to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, against 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA designates the host countries
In the midst of suspicions of corruption, FIFA’s executive committee on Thursday appointed the host countries for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, an eminently political choice where influence struggles and lobbying are likely to catch up on technical criteria.
One thing is for sure, the 2018 edition of the FIFA Queen competition will take place in Europe, the traditional bastion of the discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, the Netherlands).
That of 2022 will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its deployment in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities who are part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the heads of government of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measure of the economic and political stakes of a World Cup.
Backstage treatments are therefore likely to last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among the candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not weigh very heavily on the 22 members of the executive committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, the source of the revelations that resulted in the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have ruined the chances of his country, the cradle of football that only hosted the World Cup once, in 1966.
The BBC on Monday released a documentary that pinned three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
There is nothing to dissatisfaction with FIFA and embarrassing British officials, who have been lobbying intensely in recent weeks with David Cameron in the front row.
The head of government hopes to reissue the successful blow by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had won the London 2012 Olympics in 2005.
Will this intense activity suffice to adorn the coat of arms of England with the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the duo Spain-Portugal is not lacking in strength with its already ready stadiums, its expertise (Mondial-82 in Spain, JO-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the dark economic and financial prospects of the two countries could shower their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase the rating of Russia, which has become a weighty outsider despite the shortcomings of its record (stadions, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to make the move to Zurich and denounced "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a barely veiled allusion to the accusations of the English press against members of the EC.
“We cover them with mud, we try to compromise them,” Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, strong from the 1994 experience, appears as the logical favorites.
As the world’s leading economic power, home to FIFA’s main sponsors, the country seems to be ahead of Japan and South Korea, who have built a beautiful project separately.
But these new applications appear premature for two countries that co-hosted the test in 2002.
Another threat: the granting of the 2026 World Cup to China, ardently desired by FIFA, which would in fact make the Asian chances for 2022 lapse.
With Qatar coming out of the big game offering futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion into new countries, but these two countries present more risks than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weakness of TV rights paid (due to the time difference) by European countries, the nerve of war for FIFA.
Second mandate: the obvious
De Gaulle was hesitant.
Mitterrand had made him think he was hesitating.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not hesitate.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
One mandate at the Elysée calls for another.
So the current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But the obvious doesn’t go well with the share of mystery attached to the presidential office.
So we have to act as if doubt still exists.
In one sense as in the other.
In 2006, even without believing it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On November 15, with a serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that he would make his decision "somewhere in the fall of 2011".
That he evoked in front of UMP parliamentarians, Tuesday evening at the Elysée, the prospect of "two terms" sowed a bit of feverishness.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
We were far from it.
The President merely recalled that the 2008 constitutional revision limited the number of five-years to two.
He was making a statement, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he has talked about the presidential election, in the tone of humor, during such meetings.
"At worst, or at best, you still have seven and a half years with me," he told them in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the next step."
His words of yesterday do not make him more a candidate than the day before; they do not make him less.
If there are any comments, it is for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race to the candidacy for the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the entry into the race of Ségol<0xC3><0xA8>ne Royal that prompts Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
This is on the contrary because his candidacy in 2012 is obvious that many in the PS are calling for a battle order earlier than expected.
The wrong polls, on the other hand.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer the candidacy of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% vs. 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the UMP on this," the prime minister's entourage reacted immediately and cautiously.
"If he believes defeat is possible, he will not be a candidate," said Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the obvious.
Euro: ECB Forced to Maintain Purchases of Government Securities
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should be an opportunity to clarify the modalities for exiting the crisis or, at least, to announce the cessation of a number of unconventional monetary policy operations that are due to end by the end of the year.
The European sovereign debt crisis obliges, the Frankfurt Issuing Institute will probably not be able to afford to be as peremptory or worsen a more than tense situation on the European bond markets today.
The political cost would be all the higher.
Yesterday, at a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde praised the ECB's active role in resolving the sovereign debt crisis in Europe.
It did not want to say whether it believed the central bank needed to do more, for example by increasing its sovereign bond purchase program.
"I reserve my thoughts to my European partners (...) ".
The day before, in Brussels, during his hearing by the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not show more articulate about his intentions, merely indicating that the program of buying government securities on the secondary market "will decide that we "continued to" and that
The only certainty is that the ECB will keep its main policy rate unchanged at 1%, its historic low since May 2009.
In fact, the ECB’s Treasury bond purchases doubled last week to nearly <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.35 billion.
And, according to the indiscretions of market operators, it made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem have bought for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt about the expectations of continued purchases (see page 29).
Economists also do not expect a noticeable change of direction.
While longer-term lending operations have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited cash allocations on generous terms and for periods ranging from one week to three months.
Economists today expect this scheme to be extended by a few months.
“I can’t imagine that it is significantly changing its program.”
“Otherwise, it would be taking the risk of causing new tensions in the short term,” said Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
“A gradual exit announced in the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely,” predicts Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In terms of its interventions in the public debt market, “the ECB should maintain a purchase volume of these bonds in order to animate an atone market,” adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to sovereign debt markets in the euro area, the issuer has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must at all costs replace the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent packaging of the returns paid by the most fragile states," a senior bond manager testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates go up, the states will be all the more embarrassed to reduce their debt, if not stabilize it.
The safeguarding of the euro is at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government is turning its back
After a worrying start to the week for Italy, the situation relaxed a little yesterday, with the reflux of 10-year bond rates.
A return to precarious calm.
On leaving a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents said they heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "unencryptable" and expect an "unpredictable" weekend, which the interested party later denied.
On Tuesday, in any case, the gap with the long German rates had reached the record of 210 basis points and the price of hedge contracts against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) had risen to 263 points, leading to a certain crowding in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain the gap with German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, said he was "strongly concerned" about "market turbulence" and a possible contagion from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the eurozone’s third-largest economy, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that it’s like Portugal,” says Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, its problem is the lack of growth and the atonement of tax revenues that goes with it, causing the state to run the risk of no longer being able to cover its financing needs.
Brussels’ latest forecast was a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget under review in the Senate stands at 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates, the government deficit will still represent 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% forecast by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumor of a new budget collective that could be set up after the holidays, for an amount of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, further austerity measures will have to be taken," said Olli Rehn, the commissioner for economic affairs.
For now, Italy is receiving support from international institutions.
"The fundamentals of its economy are in order and its accounts are good, we have been repeating this for a long time," said Arrigo Sadun, Italy's administrator at the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy at the IMF.
“There is no immediate, short-term or long-term problem, because despite its large debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts required of Italy are less than those required of other countries,” observes Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD chief economist.
There remains the question of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, following which early elections could be held at the end of March.
This would open up a period that is not conducive to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms
Christine Lagarde hammered it again yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "Europeans, I believe that it has been demonstrated again on Sunday in the day and at night, are obviously in solidarity, determined, committed to defending their currency and their currency zone."
Although all relative, the relaxation recorded yesterday on the rates of European government bonds brought water to the mill of governments and the ECB.
But we cannot talk about the beginning of normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's has announced that it could degrade Portugal's debt rating, the target most targeted today by speculation.
“As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which weighs on banking systems in particular,” economists at Exane BNP Paribas say.
“Political time is much slower than market time.”
Aware of this hiatus and the dangers it poses, European countries are stepping up discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis arrangements.
Informal consultations between the most directly concerned finance ministers and, more broadly, with their G20 peers are going well.
This is also in view of the meetings of the Eurogroup and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the menu, the fate of the unconventional measures of support to the countries of the euro area in the collimator of the markets (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, on Tuesday began a tour of Asia in Singapore to inform Far Eastern investors of developments in the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the ground for it.
The first issuance of EFSF securities is scheduled for next month.
A U.S. official told Reuters yesterday that the United States would support a possible increase in funds mobilized by an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
The countries that are at the forefront, Portugal and Spain, for their part, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular as regards the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that are in addition to tighter-acting austerity measures.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different path than those of Greece and Ireland.
Both sides are keen to avoid seeking international assistance before implementing their own budgetary corrections and deciding on the structural reforms necessary to restore lasting confidence.
Finally, European donors are discussing the options available to speed up the process of normalising sovereign bond markets.
In Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber first proposed that if the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to hand over the portfolio.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European sovereign debt market, believe an extension of around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion would suffice, “preferably” in the form of a direct cash injection.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, with <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion to date.
A council that has every chance of being carefully examined in European capitals.
Especially if the market conditions get worse.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in orange vigilance
Snowfall still causes traffic difficulties, particularly on the secondary network in Brittany, and is likely to disrupt certain economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now on orange alert due to the risk of snow and ice.
The Eure, the Eure-et-Loir, the Deux-S<0xC3><0xA8>vres and the Vienne, joined the 20 departments already in orange vigilance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later in the night.
According to Meteo France, sustained snow showers affect the north of the Gironde and the Charentes and it snows lightly on the Ile-de-France.
Snow layers ranging from 2 to 5 cm, occasionally from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm for the Parisian region.
The departments concerned are those of the Charente, Charente-Maritime, C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and those of the Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin regions.
The snowy episodes are notable enough to cause traffic difficulties and disrupt certain economic activities, warns Météo France.
In the C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, several departmentals have been banned for heavy goods vehicles over 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
Traffic on the secondary network in Brittany is very difficult according to the gendarmes who recommend to take his vehicle only in case of need and the traffic of some TER buses has been suspended for the day.
School transportation was banned for Thursday in Picardy.
No specific measures were envisaged on Wednesday evening to restrict the movement of heavy goods vehicles.
The prefecture "invites all motorists to exercise the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving accordingly."
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at Paris airport in Roissy and 10% in Orly on Thursday due to upcoming snowfalls.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In the UK, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate over the modernization of transport in Ile-de-France is full, billions have been raining.
In the discussion at least.
In particular, there are 23 billion for the Grand Paris metro to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this SGP, the State announced a capital endowment of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, it is this amount that will then allow the GSP to borrow part of the financing of its double loop on the markets.
Today, we finally get to the first additions.
The amending Finance Act 2010, discussed in the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the arrangements for finding the beginning of this money.
There are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in the tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, read in the text of the bill, article 15, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is numbered: "The proceeds of this tax is 117 million euros per year".
The second is a redevelopment of a tax on offices that already exists "in order to modernize it, increase its product and affect this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
Would that tell you how much?
Mysteries.
It is not encoded in the text.
We're far from $4 billion.
"It is specified that these tax resources are in addition to the 4 billion euros of the capital endowment that will be mobilized by the state and brought to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses," reads the statement of reasons.
At SGP, we don't find this system shocking.
"From the moment you create revenues (both taxes), you can cover the studies over three years and then type in the 4 billion after that," it explains.
"It will be in the budget and drawn as it goes."
The SGP estimates that the $4 billion will begin to be entered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This arrangement, in which the promised 4 billion are still to the absent subscribers, is likely to provoke a somewhat turbulent parliamentary discussion.
First public meeting on 7 December.
Avenger Hackers and Spies in Diligence
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it turns out to be an apparent scandal, a scandal that only appears as a scandal in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level, and foreshadows a future dominated by regression.
But let's proceed by order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that every file made up of a secret service (of any nation) is made up exclusively of press cuts.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits only report what for months could be read in any newspaper (except those Berlusconi owns), and Gaddafi's sinisterly caricatured profile was long overdue for cabaret artists.
The rule that secret files should be composed only of news already known is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each book repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau, the Templars or the Rose-Cross) exactly what was already written in the previous books.
And this is not only because the author of occult texts does not like to do unpublished research (nor knows where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe only what they already know, and who reconfirms what they had already learned.
It is the mechanism of success of Dan Brown.
Same goes for the secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or of limited mind) the head of the secret services (otherwise he could be, I know, the editor of Libération), who retain as true only what he recognizes.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the U.S. Embassy in Rome sent to the State Department was the same as Newsweek published the week before.
So why did the revelations on these files make so much noise?
On the one hand, they say what every cultivated person already knows, namely that the embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since the heads of state can call or take a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small exercises of representation, have become centers.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is only through hypocrisy that one pretends to ignore it.
However, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker could capture the most secretive secrets of the world’s most powerful country is a not-too-negligible blow to the prestige of the State Department.
So the scandal does not put so much the victims in crisis as the "strangers".
But let’s come to the profound nature of what happened.
Once upon a time, in Orwell's time, one could conceive of all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwellian prophecy had been fully proven since, being able to control every movement through the telephone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway taken, and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the eye of power.
But when it is shown, as it is now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker – elected as the citizen’s avenger – can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the power to keep its own secrets hold?
It is true, Georg Simmel has already said, that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true, that knowing everything about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed an empty secret, because it is in the public domain; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks has done, that all the secrets of Hillary Clinton are empty secrets to her.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but it has done too much to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this injury inflicted on a very powerful power?
It is obvious that in the future, states will no longer be able to put online any reserved information - this would mean publishing it on a poster glued to the corner of the street.
But it is just as obvious that with current technologies, it is futile to hope to be able to maintain confidential reports over the phone.
Nothing is easier than to find out if and when a head of state flew and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and reserved relationships be maintained in the future?
I know that, for the moment, my prediction is science fiction and is therefore romantic, but I am obliged to imagine government agents who move discreetly in due diligence on uncontrollable routes, carrying only messages learned by heart or, at the most, hiding the rare information in writing.
The information will be kept in one copy in locked drawers: deep down, the Watergate spying attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the technology is now advancing in crab, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet restored a wired telegraph (telephones).
The (analog) videotapes had allowed film researchers to explore a film step by step, going back and forth and discovering all the secrets of editing, while now the (digital) CDs only allow you to jump from chapter to chapter, that is, by macroportions.
With high-speed trains, we go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, and the trips it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not surprising that the policy and communication techniques come back to horse-drawn cars.
One last observation.
In the past, the press was trying to understand what was going on inside the embassies.
Now, it is the embassies that are asking for confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France is booing its funding promises
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine the fulfilment of the promises of fast-start or early funding made by developed countries.
And the big French tweets are revealed.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries committed to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has pledged <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion over three years and France <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.26 billion (or 420 million per year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU launched the big game to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start funding: a report detailing the action of its member states, a press conference, a major side event, distribution of brochures...
The Transparency Operation is appreciable and valued at its fair value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
The EU announced that it had raised <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on track to meet its commitment of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look at the details, things are more complicated.
This money must be, according to the Copenhagen agreement, "new and additional" to ensure that additional effort is made without being at the expense of official development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some Member States whose France blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
For example, the European Commission has taken 2009 as a reference year: international funding is maintained, and it adds 150 million over three years under fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers that the funding of "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to previous years' expenditure or to the overall level of Official Development Assistance.
Concretely, the total amount of France’s support to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), it claims to meet its commitment to “new and additional” financing...
Another crucial element is the distribution between donations and loans.
Again, there is no rule and everyone chooses their calculation method.
Some, like France, consider that 1<0xE2><0x82><0xAC> borrowed is equivalent to 1<0xE2><0x82><0xAC> given.
Obviously, this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to the mitigation of emissions that are based on more efficient technologies), it is fallacious to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is given... At most, the loan's value should only be counted as the amount of its commitments.
But France only has to do with such a reasoning: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% donations (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document to check for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union to use the loan so massively.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (in others) meet their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union puts <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 to meet its commitment, France puts only 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
Nice pass-through tour!
In short, in its fast start financing, France is operating a double scam: on the one hand on the evolution of the action over time and on the other hand on the reality of the financial effort.
By spending only <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>36.1 million, she comes to believe that she is spending <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>420 million "new and additional" in line with her promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that Bercy carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would other Member States continue to give if it is enough to lend?) and in the negotiations since developing countries are not completely deceived...
The early funding chapter is only a small, relatively short-term issue compared to all the climate discussions.
But it could be one more grain of sand in the huge machine that is the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
In any case, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
First, France could announce a change in its accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and fairness with the other countries of the European Union.
But most importantly, France could push forward the discussions on the issues of long-term financing (another crucial chapter currently discussed): the question of "additionality" or the way in which loans are accounted for will not be avoided.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister of the Environment, Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France’s fast start and its vision of “additionality” and the use of loans would naturally increase the level of international confidence needed to move forward in the discussions.
Alert to pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old child ingests 81 different chemicals in one day, according to a study published Wednesday by the Générations Futures (formerly the Movement for the Rights and Respect of Future Generations) association.
The association, which warns that its results "have no significant statistical value in view of the low number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem", bought between July and September the foods generally consumed in four meals and an encadas in a day by a child of about ten years, in the supermarkets of Paris and Paris.
These standard meals, including official recommendations - five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day - as well as sweets, have been examined by laboratories looking for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance sheet is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, 42 of which are classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five substances classified as certain carcinogens, as well as 37 substances likely to act as endocrine disruptors (PEs), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Although, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each individual chemical substance taken are not exceeded, our survey clearly shows that the reality of consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic and/or PE contaminants is of concern," notes the association.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three proven to be certain carcinogens, as well as nearly twenty residues likely to disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, planned as a snack by the study, has traces of six chemical substances, one of which is banned in France.
The same goes for Kenya’s green beans, included in the lunch, on which the study found traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, chopped steak, canned tuna, and even breadstick and chewing gum were loaded with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the tap water the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
For dinner, salmon steak was the most “rich” with 34 chemical residues detected and even the examination of the plastic plate used to heat the microwave meal was not exempt.
The final risk to the consumer of this “contaminant cocktail” is “probably underestimated,” according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "in the face of the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop "the increase of civilization diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reported the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
