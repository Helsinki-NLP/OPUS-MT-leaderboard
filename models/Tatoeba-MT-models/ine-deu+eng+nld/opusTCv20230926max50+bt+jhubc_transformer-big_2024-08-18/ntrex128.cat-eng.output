Members of the Welsh Assembly concerned about 'identifying them as Muppets'
Several members of the Assembly have expressed their dismay at the proposal to modify its title by MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This controversy has arisen at the root of the plan to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly of all the different political parties have shown their concern that this measure may become a cause for ridicule.
A member of the Labour party's assembly said his party was concerned that MWP "reunited with Twp or Pwp".
For non-Welsh readers: In Welsh, twp means stupid and, pwp, excrement.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party's assembly has commented that the whole of his party "does not see it with good eyes" and has proposed several alternatives.
For his part, a Welsh Conservative member has claimed that his group was "open" to the name change, but also commented that there is too little difference between the term "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, it must be said that the letter "w" in Welsh is pronounced similarly to the English letter "u" in Yorkshire.
According to the committee of the assembly in charge of drafting the legal draft to introduce the name changes: "The final decision on any qualifying to appoint the members of the assembly will, of course, fall on the members themselves."
The 2017 Act of the Welsh Government gives the Assembly of Wales all power to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, with broad support for the proposal to change the name of the assembly to that of the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of the members of the assembly, although the committee chose "Members of the Welsh Parliament" or "WPM", the "MWP" option was the one that received wider support in the public consultation.
Apparently, members of the assembly are suggesting different alternatives. However, the attempt to reach a consensus can be a complete blunder for the Speaker of the assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to present the legal draft on the changes in a matter of weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on disqualification of its members and the design of the committee system.
The members of the Assembly shall hold the final vote on its name during the debate related to the legislation.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum to change their country's name
Citizens will choose on Sunday whether or not they want to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular consultation was decided in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which already has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a way of claiming its territory and has repeatedly opposed attempts by that country to become part of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opposed to the plebiscite on the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, those in favour, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the name change is simply the price to pay to become a member of the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells stop ringing: the difficulties of the churches of Harlem
“Historically, the older people I spoke to say there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
"Today, there is none of them."
According to Adams, the disappearance of bars can be understood.
“People have a different way of socializing today,” he says.
"The bars have already ceased to be that kind of living room for the neighborhood where people used to go periodically."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of assets will not last as long as their leaders expect, "and that sooner or later they will return to where they came from."
The churches, he adds, could end up being replaced by apartment buildings and condominiums with the kind of people who will be of no help to the temples that remain in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he says, “and therefore what they will do will be to speed up the closure of all churches, as it is quite unlikely that the majority of people who move to these condominiums will end up being members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis; the Metropolitan Community church in 1870 and St. Martin's ten years later.
The white Methodist congregation that was originally there left during the 1930s.
A black congregation nearby acquired the property of the building.
St. Martin's passed into the hands of a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, one of Harlem's main shopping streets, who resisted hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire caused serious damage to the building, and when Reverend Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it, it was then that they commissioned the lane.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's Church, proudly described the lane as "the bells of the poor people".
The expert who sounded the railing in July described it differently: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also observed that it was the first lane in the world that was played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had to move to the largest lane of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has sounded in St. Martin's in recent months, on the contrary, have been the complicated stories of architects and contractors, some of them led by lay leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
The council, the governing body of the parish, made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese last July expressing concern that the diocese "would intend to pass on the costs" to the council, although the latter did not send in the hiring of architects and laymen.
Some parishioners have complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark injures a 13-year-old boy while searching for lobsters in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he dived to search for lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, authorities said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel on KSWB-TV in San Diego, he spent half an hour diving with some friends on Saturday morning when he heard the cries of a boy asking for help. Then they rowed with a group to the place where the boy was to help him get out of the water.
Hammel says that first he thought it was about the joy of having caught a lobster, but then he "realized that I was shouting 'I've been bitten!
I've been bitten!"
He had his entire clavicle ripped off," Hammel observed as he reached the boy.
“For everyone to get out of the water, I shouted, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” added Hammel.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was hospitalized.
It is not known which shark species is responsible for the attack.
In a press conference, rescuer Larry Giles commented that for a few weeks a shark had been detected in the area, but that it was decided that the species was not dangerous.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper torso area.
Authorities closed access to the beaches from Ponto Beach to Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans for the UK beauty products market
Sainsbury's has decided to compete in Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty product walkways in the style of busy department stores with specialized employees.
These large corridors are only part of a considerable investment in the beauty products market in the UK, a market that moves around <0xC2><0xA3>2800 million and continues to grow as the fashion and home products sectors are left behind, and will be tested at 11 stores across the country to try it out a year later.
The investment in beauty products is a product of the greed of supermarkets to take advantage of the space in their shelves that was previously intended for televisions, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury’s says it will double its beauty offering to offer up to 3,000 different products, including first-time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space with areas of similar brands that can be found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket company is also in the relaunch phase of its Boutique make-up range so that most of the products are now vegan-friendly, an aspect increasingly sought after by younger consumers.
The Fragrance Shop, in addition, will open concessions at two Sainsbury's stores. The first did so last week in Croydon, south London, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and the change to a habit of buying food in smaller quantities every day in small supermarkets has made large supermarkets have to find other ways to convince people to come.
According to Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury’s, stores will increasingly resemble department stores in an attempt by the supermarket chain to fight discount supermarkets Aldi and Lidl with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has been introducing Argos outlets to many of its supermarkets, in addition to a number of Habitat stores since it acquired both chains two years ago, which, he says, has served to relaunch grocery sales and increase the profitability of purchases.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to relaunch its beauty and pharmacy product departments resulted in a failure.
Sainsbury's made a joint operation test with Boots in the early 2000s, but it all ended abruptly by not agreeing on how to split the profits of the pharmacy chain into supermarkets.
This new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281 pharmacies business to Celesio, owner of LloydsPharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
According to Sainsbury's, Lloyds will play an important role in the global plan, as it will expand the range of luxury brands of skin products, such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury’s, comments: “We’ve transformed the look of our beauty product walkways to improve the environment for our customers.
We have invested in specially trained workers who will be of great help when it comes to offering advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit any need; on the other hand, the attractive environment and convenient location make us now one of the preferred destinations for beauty products and challenging the traditional way of shopping.
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby backs <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Dragons' star Peter Jones left "angry" after television host Holly Willoughby pulled back an <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with Jones' lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn’t have time to dedicate himself to the Truly household products and accessories joint business.
The business of these two media characters had come to be compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The presenter of This Morning, 37, used Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' star Peter Jones enraged by stepping down at the last minute of the lucrative lifestyle-branded joint venture to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which will also bring her great benefits.
According to several sources, Jones was "angry" when the redhead television star admitted, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at her empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the presenter's new agreements, worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, implied that she would no longer have enough time to dedicate to the brand.
The business had come to be compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and aspired to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones took a private plane to one of his holiday homes outside the UK.
According to one source, "Truly was by far Holly's top priority.
It was meant to be her long-term future and where we would see her for the next twenty or thirty years.
His decision to back down left all the parties involved speechless.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, we were so close to the launch...
Right now there is a warehouse full of goods at Marlow headquarters ready to be sold.”
According to experts, the departure of the presenter of This Morning, one of the most profitable stars in the UK, could cost the company millions due to the significant investment that had been made in products, from pillows and candles to clothing and clothing for the home, and the possibility of delays for the home.
This could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin had maintained an intimate relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined it as president last March.
Both couples spend the holidays together. In addition, Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's television producer.
Willoughby will be the next brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones commented last night that "We won't comment on your business."
Hard accusations... "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the possible criticism he received from the media to make a comment that some would consider "unusual to a president" and to have such a positive opinion of the North Korean leader.
Why did Trump give up so much?
Trump said, all mocking the tone of voice of a news anchor:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He noted that Kim had an interest in holding a second meeting after the first in Singapore in June was declared a major step towards North Korea's denuclearization.
Negotiations on denuclearization are stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, senior North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the leaders of the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "corresponding response" by the US to its country's first disarmament initiatives.
However, he noted, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions with the aim of maintaining pressure.
Trump’s point of view, on the other hand, was much more optimistic in his speech.
“We are doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to declare war on North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
And now we have this great relationship.”
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results: ending missile tests, helping to release hostages and returning home from the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about relationships with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this crowded compound, we would have about 200,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
An Island Destroyed and Hundreds Killed by Tsunami and Earthquake in Indonesia
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organizations in other countries were told that they were not necessary.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population had to be displaced, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not seek international assistance, so the situation is quite demanding," said Ms. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it is not yet certain that foreign people can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster agency, commented that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether or not international agencies are allowed to contribute when offering aid.
Given the constant earthquakes that Indonesia suffers, the country unfortunately remains unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although shelters have been built in Aceh in the event of a tsunami, they are not frequent on other coasts.
The apparent lack of warning sirens in Palu in the event of a tsunami, although there was a warning in place, is highly likely to have contributed to the number of deaths.
Moving between the huge number of islands in Indonesia is, at best, a challenge.
And natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship docked in Lombok to care for the victims of the earthquake is now heading towards Palu; however, it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo had as a central element of his election campaign the improvement of Indonesia's poor infrastructure, and has invested huge amounts of money in roads and railways.
However, Joko's government faces re-election next year with funding deficits.
Joko also faces pressure from the country's ongoing sectarian tensions, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative fall faith.
More than 1,000 dead and tens of thousands displaced are the result of fighting in the streets between Christian and Muslim gangs with machetes, bows and arrows, and other bloody weapons.
Observe: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool makes the goal of the match with a long-distance shot against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with his 89-minute goal at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 metres from Chelsea's goal when his team was losing 1-0.
He settled the ball to the left before letting go of an incredible shot aimed at the second goal.
The shot crossed the entire area with a great elevation as it propelled towards the right junction of the gate.
The ball finally started descending over a Kepa Arrizabalaga in full jump to try to stop it and ended up at the bottom of the net.
"I was just trying to get to that position to shoot, and players like Shaqiri always play it forward as much as possible, so I tried to create as much time as possible for myself," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kanté coming, I made a touch and I didn’t think about it much, I just dedicated myself to shooting.”
Chelsea won 1-0 on the break after scoring a goal in the 25th minute with their Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In the play, the Blue team's frontman returned a pass to Mateo Kovacic before starting from almost midfield and sprinting towards Liverpool's field.
Kovacic made a quick combination from the midfield.
He then made a magnificent in-depth pass, which left Hazard inside the area with the ball controlled.
Hazard overcame the defense to finish the second goal with a left-footed shot where Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker could not reach.
Liverpool will face Naples in the Champions League group stage next Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea, for their part, will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Death toll from Indonesia tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, according to data from the country's disaster agency reported on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the ruins of the collapsed buildings due to the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that took place on Friday and caused waves of up to 6 meters, according to news agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was completely covered by the ruins of the destroyed buildings.
Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Man Suspected of Murder After Finding a Stalked Woman
The murder investigation began after the woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with several stabbings in Grayson Mews, John Street; then a 32-year-old man was arrested as a murder suspect.
Police have asked residents of the area to have seen or heard anything in connection with the crime to appear before the authorities.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "While the investigation is still in a preliminary phase, I would like to call on anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and who had seen or heard anything suspicious, please contact us.
I would also like to make a call to anyone, especially taxi drivers who have been able to capture anything through the on-board camera of the car, to get in touch, as they may have vital information for the investigation.
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman's body is from Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman have come to the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
As investigations continue, police have said they are reporting the incident to relatives closest to the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment, but police have told him that no one has been allowed in or out of the building.
When he found out what had happened, he was speechless.
Residents are advised to spend hours until they can re-enter.
It was felt as a police officer explained to a man that the whole area is treated as the scene of the crime.
A woman appeared on the scene crying.
I keep repeating, “It’s terrible!”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were inside the locked area with another van parked outside.
A number of agents remained within the locked zone controlling the block of flats.
Anyone who may have information is asked to send a message directly to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously via 0800 555 111 and mentioning file 247 dated September 30.
The statue of Cromwell of the British Parliament becomes the last monument affected by the discussion around "rewriting history"
His disappearance would be a kind of poetic justice for the Taliban's purest-style destruction of so many cultural and religious objects in England perpetrated by his fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society has described Crick's proposal as a "bullshit" and an "attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, comments: "In the current debate around the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's figure in front of the Palace of Westminster would become one of the main objectives.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps he would end up sacrificing the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor he did during the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a testament to 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure still believed to be worthy of commemoration.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than now, as an advocate of parliament in the face of external pressure, in his obviously monarchical case.
Whether or not this constitutes a fully accurate representation remains a matter of historical debate.
What is true is that the mid-17th century conflict shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing a side of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of being celebrated and commemorated."
Swine Killer Kills Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, local sources say.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a cut artery and all covered in blood near a pig farm in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer was preparing to inject vaccines into pigs at a farm in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from nearby Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door leading to a neighboring pig farm.
According to him, in the court there was a big male pig with blood in his mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the 250-kg garrison had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My nephew had broken and bloody legs," said the nephew, surnamed "Wu", as mentioned in the evening news of Guiyang.
Scenes recorded by the security camera show Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not the property of Yuan or his cousin.
One of the market officials commented on the evening news that the pig remained closed and isolated to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police gathered evidence at the scene of the crime.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although very rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have previously been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on her farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a nearly 300-pound pig caught a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife was able to frighten the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC news that pigs are not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as "triggering".
“They like to play.
They're like children, they're very curious... they don't go with the idea of hurting.
You just have to give them the respect they deserve,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rains to the entire southwest of the United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it advances over the colder waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. over the next few days.
The Rosa had winds of 138 km/h, typical of a Category 1 hurricane, at 5:00 a.m. on Sunday, eastern U.S. time, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The Rose is expected to move northwards on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression is beginning to form in the Pacific Ocean, which is moving eastwards toward the west coast of the US. As the Rose approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to leave a strong north-northeast in direct tropical humidity.
Rosa will leave up to 250 mm of rain on Monday in some parts of Mexico.
Subsequently, tropical humidity will interact with the approaching depression to generate widespread torrential rains across the southwest over the next few days.
At various points, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, waste streams and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
The strong tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates close to 50 to 75 mm per hour at various points, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
50 to 100 mm of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially much of Arizona.
Rivers are likely to form, as the situation is deteriorating rapidly due to the dispersed nature of tropical rains.
It is totally discouraged to enter the desert on foot in the face of the threat of tropical rain.
The torrential rains could cause the gorges to become uncontrolled rivers. In addition, storms can carry wind gusts and dust clouds at specific points.
The approaching depression will bring torrential rains at certain points off the coast of Southern California.
It is possible to record total precipitation above 50 mm, which could cause smaller waste streams and slippery paths.
This would be the first rainfall of the rainy season in the region.
Isolated rain jacks will begin arriving in Arizona between Sunday night and Monday morning, before the rain becomes more widespread between Monday and Tuesday night.
The torrential rains will spread towards the Four Corners region on Tuesday and will persist throughout Wednesday.
In October, there will be several significant temperature fluctuations throughout the U.S. as the Arctic cools, although the tropics will remain quite warm.
This phenomenon can sometimes cause drastic changes in temperature in the short distance.
The central U.S. region on Sunday is a clear example of drastic temperature differences.
Temperature differences of nearly 20 degrees have been recorded between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the persistent summer heat will try to expand again.
It is expected to start in October with heat in much of the central and eastern U.S. area, with temperatures around 27 degrees from the southern Plains area to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would represent about 10 degrees above the average.
According to the long-term weather forecast, there is a good chance that temperatures above average in the eastern U.S. will occur during the first half of October.
More than 20 million viewers watched Brett Kavanaugh’s statement
More than 20 million spectators watched on Thursday the thrilling testimony of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, which allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford. The testimony was broadcast on six different television channels.
Meanwhile, the political turmoil continued, with broadcasters interrupting Friday's usual programming due to a turn of events at the last minute: an agreement designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct an investigation into the charges for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely convinced that Kavanaugh had drunkenly touched her and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an exalted witness, stated that he was absolutely convinced that this never happened.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that more than 20.4 million spectators saw this testimony on Friday.
The company had average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
Audience figures were not immediately available from other broadcasters, such as PBS, C-SPAN or Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen often has trouble calculating the people who see it from his office.
Put into perspective, it is an audience similar to that of an American football playoff game or that of the Oscars ceremony.
The Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders have clearly backed Kavanaugh's nomination, was the network with the most audience, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day's testimony, according to Nielsen.
The ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS grossed $3.1 million, NBC $2.94 million, MSNBC $2.89 million, and CNN $2.52 million, according to Nielsen data.
Interest remains high after the testimonial.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying they would vote for Kavanaugh, Flake was caught on CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as he was teased by protesters as he tried to climb an elevator to go to a courtroom.
Flake stayed several minutes with his eyes closed as he was caught live on CNN television.
“Here I am, in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth in this country?
They said to him, ‘You have power, while there are so many women who do not have it!’”
Flake said his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator doors were closed, commented that he would have more to say in the committee's view.
Within hours, all cable and broadcast chains were already broadcasting live at the time when the Judiciary Committee was to vote on whether or not to proceed with Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate plenary to be put to a vote.
Flake said, instead, that he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would investigate allegations against the nominee in the coming week, a condition demanded by the minority of Democrats.
Flake was convinced in part by the conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a subsequent conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was influential, as it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to support Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'playing politics' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticized her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and of disregarding the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party congress in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with May on the front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on the so-called Chequers Brexit plan, where he states that the proposal that the UK and the EU recoup taxes on each other is "completely absurd".
Wayde Sims Shooting Murder: Police Arrest Suspect Dyteon Simpson for Death of LSU Team Player
Police have arrested a suspect in the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who campaigned for the LSU team.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and sent to prison on charges of second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge police department.
The authorities made public a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson. According to police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA in them, according to the CBS affiliate WAFB.
After interrogating Simpson, he admitted that Wayde had been shot dead, according to police.
His bail has been set at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
The East Baton Rouge district coroner's office released a preliminary report on Friday, claiming the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head in the direction of the neck.
The department is grateful to the Louisiana State Police’s fugitive task force, the State Police’s forensics laboratory, Southern University police and local citizens for their help in the investigation that culminated in the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva expressed his gratitude to the area's law enforcement for their "diligence and for pursuing justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player on the LSU team.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds to leave last season.
On Friday morning, LSU team basketball coach Will Wade commented that the team is "devastated" and that Wayde's death was "a very strong blow".
“Things like this are what make you suffer at all times,” Wade said.
A volcano splashes ash in Mexico City
The ash spiked by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater was detected and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded over a 24-hour period.
The center was overseeing several sprints and tremors that had occurred recently.
Images on social networks where a thin layer of ash is appreciated on the windshields of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in activity from the volcano located 72 km southeast of the capital since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists shortly before the anniversary of the referendum on independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police and thousands of people joined protests to commemorate the first anniversary of the vote that took place in Catalonia on its secession.
A group of independentist individuals detained by riot police began throwing eggs and powder paint at them, causing dark clouds of dust to appear on the streets normally invaded by tourists.
Later that day, clashes occurred with the police, who used their poles to contain the violent protesters.
For several hours, independentist groups sang "Don't forget, don't forgive" face-to-face with unionist protesters shouting "Long life in Spain".
Fourteen people had to be treated for minor injuries suffered during the protests, according to local sources.
Tensions have not subsided in this independence-minded region a year after a referendum was held on October 1 that was considered illegal by Madrid but was still held by Catalan separatists.
Voters chose independence by a very large majority, although the participation rate was low, as opponents of secession largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote by entering polling stations across the region, which led to violent clashes.
The independence groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place anyway, but the demonstrators were forced to take another route.
Narc<0xC3><0xAD>s Termes, 68-year-old electrician and one of the participants in the independence demonstration along with his wife, said that he no longer had much hope about the possibilities for Catalonia to achieve independence.
“Last year we had one of the best times.
I saw my parents cry with joy because they could vote, but now we are stuck,” he said.
Despite achieving a vital victory, albeit by little, in the autonomous elections last December, Catalan independentist parties have suffered to maintain the momentum this year, as many of their main leaders are in a later self-imposed exile or arrested pending trial for their role.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, records the demonstration of support for the police with his phone, and claims that the conflict has been revived by politicians from both sides.
“Tension only increases,” he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders jailed before the trial since late last year, announced that he would participate in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Presenting as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the decline in democratic values and the repression that we have seen on the part of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after dressing up a house with a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car repeatedly rigged against a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. local time.
Inspector Bob Blemmings says damage was done to the doors and the building itself.
It is also possible that at some point, someone shot a crossbow at the car.
A play of Menga gives the victory to Livingston 1-0 against the Rangers
Dolly Menga’s first goal with Livingston was a win.
Livingston, who had risen to the top this year, surprised the Glasgow Rangers in what is just Steven Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as the club's manager for the Ibrox neighborhood.
Dolly Menga's move made the difference, as, with this victory, Gary Holt's team rise to second position, which they share with the Hibernian.
Gerrard's, on the other hand, continue without winning away at the Premiership this season. Next Sunday they will face the leader, the Hearts, with whom they separate an eight-point difference.
But before that, the Rangers receive this Thursday the Vienna Rapid in the Europa League.
Livingston, meanwhile, extends his undefeated streak in the league to six games, with a Holt as coach who still doesn't know what the defeat is since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston does not take advantage of its opportunities in front of the direct play of visitors
Holt's team should have been ahead of the score well before the goal, as their direct play caused all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made his way between the defense, but wasted his opportunity when he found himself in front of the goal. Afterwards, Alan Lithgow sent the ball out stretching to try to finish Craig Halkett's header pass, which crossed the goal.
The locals were fine to let the Rangers approach their area, as they knew that they could put visitors in trouble in isolated games.
And that’s how this decisive goal came about.
The referee whistled a foul against the Rangers' interests and Livingston made an opening for the band, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined so Menga could touch her first and finish from the central part of the area.
Until that time, the Rangers had dominated possession, but encountered an impenetrable defense and a goalkeeper Liam Kelly who had very little work throughout the game,
The scene was repeated in the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a stop of merit.
For his part, Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor stopped with his feet one time by Scott Pittman and Lithgow ended up diverted another combined play by Livingston.
The Rangers used to hang up and down balls in the Livingston area, only to be rejected. In addition, two penalties were claimed, one for an alleged entry by Halkett to substitute Glenn Middleton, and one by hand. Both were dismissed.
Livingston "phenomenal": analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and great result for Livingston.
A man thinks they were excellent, and they continue to exceed all expectations in this ascending trajectory.
His style of play and staff have hardly changed since his return to the top category, although much of the credit must be attributed to Holt for the way he has galvanized the team since his arrival.
There was a good group of heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, leading a perfectly organized defense, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall had to be on Menga's watch throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked inspiration, however.
Despite the bright moments exhibited with Gerrard as coach, they have definitely not been able to maintain the level.
They did not know how to create opportunities (only once they clearly surpassed the local defense), and that the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table, should take it as a warning.
Cheerful reception for Erdogan in Cologne
All were smiles and clear skies on Saturday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the first day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aimed to repair relations between the two NATO allies.
These had deteriorated due to issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then moved to Cologne to inaugurate a new giant mosque.
This city has the largest Turkish population in the world outside of Turkey.
Police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, although a large number of followers approached the mosque to see its president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also made themselves heard as they condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
Both demonstrations reflect the division of opinions around the visitor, considered a hero by some German Turks and titled a dictator by others.
Deptford traffic accident: a cyclist dies in a collision with a car
A cyclist has died as a result of a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a heavily trafficked area of Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 a.m. local time.
The driver of the vehicle stopped and, although paramedic services attended to the cyclist, he died in the act.
The accident comes months after another cyclist died in a runaway car crash on Childers Street, 1.6 km from the crash site on Saturday.
Metropolitan police have said their agents are working to identify the man and report the facts to the closest relatives.
The street has been cut and deviations have been applied to the bus routes. In addition, drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in altercation
Six prison officers have been injured in an altercation at the high-security men's prison, according to the center's office.
The events took place in Long Lartin Prison, Worcestershire, around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday, local time, and are still ongoing.
Specialized "tornado" agents moved to the site of the events to end the altercation, in which eight inmates have been involved. Lawsuit has been able to be contained by one side.
Officers had to be cared for for minor injuries to the face at the scene.
According to a prison service spokesman, “We have deployed specially trained prison personnel to look to resolve an incident in Long Martin’s prison, which is still ongoing.
Six people had to be treated with injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons. We are clear that those responsible for this altercation will have to be held accountable to the police and may have to spend even more time in the gargoyle."
There are more than 500 inmates in Long Lartin, including some of the most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was learned that the head of the prison had to be treated in a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, in October last year, riot police made an act of presence in the prison to resolve a serious altercation in which center personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with major flooding (areas with droughts could benefit)
It is not common for a tropical depression to affect Arizona, but this is exactly what is likely to happen early next week when what is left of Hurricane Rosa passes through the southwestern desert, with the consequent risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to arrive directly in Phoenix on Tuesday and is expected to approach on Monday night with rain.
The Phoenix National Meteorological Service said in a statement that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained the state of tropical storm or depression within a radius of 322 km from Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) stayed 64 km from the Arizona border.
The most recent models of the National Hurricane Center predict 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated points where up to 150 mm would be recorded in the Arizona Mogollon.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, could register 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated points of up to 100 mm.
For areas that are out of danger of flooding, the rain of Rosa could become very good news, as the region suffers from a severe drought.
Although rivers are a serious cause for concern, some of the precipitation could be very beneficial, as the southwestern region is currently suffering from a drought.
According to the U.S. drought control service, more than 40 percent of the state of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, according to weather.com.
But first, Hurricane Rosa will land on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa continued to have hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 137 km/h, and is now 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving northward at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, which causes it to lose strength.
Therefore, it is expected to land in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or evening on Monday.
Precipitation in different parts of Mexico could be strong, with a considerable risk of flooding.
According to weather.com, "total rainfall is expected from 75 to 150 mm from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with the possibility of reaching up to 250 mm."
After that, Rosa will head north across Mexico with tropical storm force, before arriving at the border with Arizona early Tuesday morning with tropical depression force, to finally cross the state of Arizona and arrive in southern Utah well entered on Tuesday night.
"The main risk we expect from Rosa or what is left of it is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the southwestern desert of the United States," according to the National Hurricane Center.
Rains are expected to cause dangerous rivers and waste streams in the deserts, coupled with landslavery in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Detained for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy has been found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found with injuries in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 a.m. on Saturday, local time.
He was taken to the hospital, where he was "stable".
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested the next day in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset police.
Agents have made a call so that anyone who may have any kind of recording of the facts with the mobile phone can be contacted.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffered from the pettyness and anger" of the Democratic party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said in an election rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "suffered the pettyness and anger" of the Democratic party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, sharply and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation of sexually abusing her decades ago, when both were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing in relation to his allegation.
The president said on Saturday that, on that day, "the American people saw Kavanaugh's genius, human quality, and courage."
“The vote to ratify Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to ratify one of the brightest minds in the legal world of our time, a lawyer with an admirable track record of serving citizens,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment as he spoke of the importance of the Republican voter turnout index in midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
“I didn’t run, but I did,” he said.
“That’s why I’m everywhere fighting for our great candidates.”
Trump argued that Democrats are dedicated to “resisting and obstructing.”
The first key procedural vote to be held in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place as late as Friday, an assistant to the Republican party's leaders told CNN.
Hundreds killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, where death toll continues to rise
At least 384 people have died, and many have been dragged by giant waves hitting the beaches, due to a severe earthquake and tsunami that has affected Indonesia's island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday on the occasion of a beach festival in the city of Palu when waves of up to six meters impacted the coast towards sunset, dragging many of the people to death and destroying everything they found in their path.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arrived yesterday, people were still carrying out their activities on the beach and did not run immediately. That's why they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the BNPB disaster mitigation agency, said in a statement in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, trunks, houses, destroyed everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved over the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before impacting the coast.
There are people who climbed up a tree fleeing the tsunami and were able to survive, he says.
Some 16,700 people had to be evacuated to 24 different centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster mitigation agency where the amount of shops and buildings destroyed, bridges turned and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water is appreciated.
Replies continued to shake up this coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's intense earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to the agency, the geographic features of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have increased the magnitude of the tsunami exponentially.
Nugroho described the damage as "considerable" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims, he says, were found trapped among the ruins of the collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were lost.
According to Nugroho, deaths and damage could increase on the coast some 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
The communications "were completely paralyzed and therefore no information was received" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its workers and volunteers were heading towards the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, which unfortunately could end up much worse," he said.
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for not reporting the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although agents said the waves arrived during the time the warning was issued.
In a recording of a fan shared on social media, one can feel how a man on the top floor of a building gives desperate shouts of warning to the people of the street about the tsunami approaching.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water bursts into the sea, taking away buildings and vehicles.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused a widespread cut in electricity supply that has disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Although the army has begun sending humanitarian aid to cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, the evacuees still desperately need food, in addition to other basic needs.
The city’s airport has reopened only for relief tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia is above 800.
The situation is very serious.
Although World Vision workers in Donggala were able to arrive safely in the city of Palu, where employees are stranded in canvas shelters installed in the courtyard of their office, during the journey they had to witness scenes of total destruction, says Doseba.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It is a catastrophe.
Although aid groups made the desolate move to begin relief work, some people complained that humanitarian workers were being prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, the collection of funds, provisions and staffing of foreign personnel can only begin to flow if the place where a disaster has occurred is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“Once the government says ‘well, it’s a national disaster,’ we can start asking for international assistance, but that level has not yet been declared.”
While she was in Palu for the second night after the earthquake and tsunami that occurred on Friday, the friends and family of the missing people kept hope that the miracle would happen and their loved ones would avoid the devastating account of the natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy caught in a sewer was rescued.
On Sunday, rescue teams released a woman who had been buried under the rune for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
In addition to Mr. Mandagi, among the people trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, there were his students.
“As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional load,” he said.
Mr. Gendon explained that, in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel among the paragliding community, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu competitors who were participating in the beach festival.
However, the messages appeared with a gray check mark instead of a blue double mark.
“I think that means the messages weren’t received,” he added.
Thieves take $26,750 while filling up an ATM in Newport on the Levee
Last Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was filling a cash machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release issued by the Newport police department.
Agent Dennis McCarthy said in a statement that the driver of the vehicle was emptying the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing it to distribute more money.
While doing his job, another man "came running behind Brink's employee" and stole from him a bag of money destined for distribution.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
On Saturday, while announcing the change on Twitter, he wrote: "Being formally known as Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West has long been nicknamed Ye, and he used this alias as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album, titled Yandhi.
The rapper replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her participation for "emotional reasons," according to the show's author.
Apart from being an abbreviation of his current artistic name, West had previously commented that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think you’re the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you,” West said earlier this year, as he talked about the title of his album with radio presenter Big Boy.
“So I’m you, I’m us.
I've gone from Kanye, which means the only one, to simply Ye, which is a reflection of our good part, our bad part, our confused part, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
West is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known by various names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, a former West collaborator, has been given his last name with or without a script and in capital letters.
Mexican President AMLO vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexico’s President-elect, Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador, has vowed never to use military force against civilians, when it takes little for the country to celebrate the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that "military force will never again be used to repress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the army opened fire during a peaceful demonstration and caused the death of 300 people at a time when student leftist movements were sweeping across Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador, who has committed to supporting young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities,
It has stated that the unemployment and lack of educational opportunities make young people feel attracted to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double the funds earmarked for AI
“While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount of money devoted to research in this field,” said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and artificial intelligence professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several members of the U.S. government announced measures on AI, despite the country's general lack of formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the world’s No. 1 in terms of AI innovation in 2030.
“Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that the rest of the countries are far behind the US and we want to be the pioneers of the next advances in the field of AI,” Lee said.
“Doubling funding could double the opportunities for the U.S. to achieve the next big AI discovery,” Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China’s most prominent AI companies.
In 1980, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that surpassed the top-ranked American Othello player and subsequently served as executive at Microsoft Research and as president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee positively assessed previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Robotics Challenge, and wondered when the next one would take place in order to identify future visionaries.
“U.S. researchers often have to work hard to get public scholarships,” Lee said.
According to Lee, “It’s not China that takes away the academic leaders; it’s the companies.”
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university eminent people to work in the AI field.
Lee commented that the U.S. task in the field of AI could also be driven by changes in immigration policy.
“I think that permanent residency cards should be automatically offered to PhD students in AI,” he added.
In July 2017, the State Council of China presented its state-of-the-art artificial intelligence development plan.
“The National Natural Sciences Foundation of China grants funds to people from academic institutions in the same way that the Natural Sciences Foundation and other U.S. public bodies donate money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is inferior to China,” Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, designed to engage collaborators from industry and academic institutions, and the White House announced the establishment of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA has announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the Foundation of Natural Sciences, currently spends more than 100 million USD a year on research in AI.
Meanwhile, no action has been taken in relation to U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence for months.
Macedonians hold referendum on whether to change the name of the country
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people held a referendum on the name change to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's applications for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims the name of its northern neighbor constitutes a claim to its territory and has barred it from entering NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not participate in the referendum, and a boycott campaign casts doubt on whether the minimum 50% participation required for the referendum to be valid will be reached.
The question indicated on the ballot paper is: “Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU, with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying for Macedonia's accession, one of the countries that was created as a result of the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I came to vote for the future of the country, so that the young people of Macedonia can live freely under the European Union, because it means that all of us will have a safer life,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have expressed that they will follow the result of the vote to make it decisive.
To change the name, a two-thirds majority is required in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission reported that no irregularities had occurred at 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared with 34% recorded in the last parliamentary elections, held in 2016, in which 66% of the people registered voted.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” Gjose Tanevski, 62, told reporters in Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in the referendum held in Macedonia on the name change of the country, which would open the way for accession to the European Union and NATO in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Parliament of Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and placing chairs in front of the tents installed by the people who would boycott the referendum.
“We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to join it with our heads high, not through the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can resort to other countries, such as China and Russia, and be part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says the accession to NATO will be accompanied by more than necessary investments in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
“I think the vast majority will vote for it, because more than 80% of the citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
Zaev stated that a “yes” would be the “confirmation of our future”.
In a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Political Research Institute, between 30% and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure below the required minimum participation.
According to the results of another poll, conducted by the Macedonian broadcaster Telma TV, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote “yes”.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the participation must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would be the first hard blow to pro-Western government policy since it took over in May last year.
Watch the video: Sergio Agüero, of Manchester City, makes a goal after regatta all the defense of Brighton
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling canceled the defence of Brighton in Manchester City's 2-0 win in the match played at Etihad Stadium, Manchester (England) on Saturday.
Agüero scored a goal in the 65th minute in a play that seemed ridiculously simple.
The Argentine forward received a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the sequence.
He left by speed between three defences of Brighton, wreaking havoc with what came out on the pitch.
Afterwards, Agüero was surrounded by four green t-shirts.
He rebuffed a defender before overtaking a few more on the edge of the Brighton area.
Then he made a pass to his left which he found Sterling.
The English forward returned the ball to the first touch, inside the area, at Agüero, who with his right leg beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan, with a chute that stuck to the inside of the net on the right side.
“Agüero has foot problems,” Pep Guardiola, the City’s coach, told reporters.
“We decided to play 55 to 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We’re lucky to have scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the initial advantage to the Sky Blues in the fight for the Premier League.
His goal came in the 29th minute.
In that play, Agüero received the ball in depth at Brighton Field and
He made a beautiful pass in space on the left side towards Leroy Sane.
Sane drove the ball before passing it to Sterling at the long pole.
The front of the Sky Blues finished the ball inside the net before coming out of the bottom line.
City face off at Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 18:55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer, without options, wants to eliminate the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoffs, there was little reason to force another opening.
But Scherzer, who is very competitive, hopes to make it to the pitching hill next Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, in case the Rockies, who have an advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western National League, have a chance to play the playoffs.
The Rockies secured a wildcard with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to get their first division title.
“Although we don’t play anything, we can at least get out there knowing the atmosphere here in Denver, and knowing that the other team will probably play every point at the highest level, like no one has done this year.
“Why would I want to lose this game?”
The Nationals have yet to announce an opener launcher for Sunday, but are apparently determined to let Scherzer take off if this situation occurs.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th opening, held a warm-up session on Thursday and pitched on Sunday, on his usual rest day.
Washington's right-handed pitcher has an 18-7 record, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 entries this season.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation around his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, as he spoke of the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
There are five weeks left for one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the great, great.. I don’t introduce myself, but in reality I do introduce myself. That’s why I’m everywhere fighting for the fantastic candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “You can see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats is happening right now.
They are determined to regain power by all necessary means, you see their pettyness, their bad intention.
They don’t care who they hurt, over who they have to pass to get power and control. That’s what they want: power and control. But we won’t give them.”
The mission of the Democrats, he said, is to “resist and obstruct.”
“And this can be seen in the last four days,” he rebuked, calling the Democrats “enraged, petty, dirty and false.”
Trump cited Dianne Feinstein, the highest-ranking Democratic senator on the Senate Judiciary Committee, as causing a loud outcry from the public.
“Do you remember his answer?
Have you filtered the document?
Hey, hey, what?
No, eh, no. Wait a minute... That was a very bad expression of body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party must cease to be a different party.
He is intolerant of those who say what they think.
When my local party’s Momentum activists voted to censor me, it didn’t surprise me.
After all, I am the last of a series of British MPs who have been told that we are not welcome, all to say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received a similar treatment because she expressed her determination against anti-Semitism.
In my case, with the motion of censure I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Ironically, these are similar issues with which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham Labour Party said in a statement Friday that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the meetings of the General Committee held on Friday night have been exactly like this.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings, and the promise of “more generous and kind” policies has long been forgotten, if ever existed.
It is increasingly clear that divergent opinions are not tolerated by the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as colleagues with whom I previously thought I shared a similar political vision expected me to turn 180° and take positions that I would never have taken, either on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, whatever I say, social networks are filled with aggressive messages calling for my candidacy not to be renewed, central policies are denounced, and I’m told it shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And that doesn’t just happen to me.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the messages I receive are usually political.
I’m impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a torrent of sexist and racist attacks every day, and they don’t fail.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is seeing how the level of abuse has normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that diverse party, and with every motion of “no confidence” or every change in the rules of selection, the party got tighter.
Over the past two years I have received a lot of advice and have been advised to keep my head down, not to be so expressive and “everything would be fine.”
I didn’t go into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, in my time as a student, stimulated by the negligent Thatcher government, which left my entire class literally submerged, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need it most, either as a local councillor or as a minister.
I have never hid my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way doubt my political positions and points of disagreement with the current direction.
To those who promoted the motion on Friday, I would say that at a time when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will harm homes, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy in my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But, in reality, the message I want to convey is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of no renewal of my candidacy or any political interest will prevent you from acting, in my opinion, in favor of

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: unbeaten Ayr lead the lead
Two last-minute rehearsals distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayrs deserved the win in this vibrant Tennant's Premiership day game.
The Ayr, who are the only unbeaten team of the ten, occupy the first position in the classification table.
In the end, the local team prevailed thanks to their defensive superiority and the fact that they knew how to take better advantage of the opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had reasons to be satisfied.
“The games we’ve played so far have put us to the test and we’re still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Melrose’s Robyn Christie said: “Congratulations to the Ayr, they’ve taken advantage of the opportunities better than we have.”
Grant Anderson's 14-minute trial, converted by Frazier Climo, put the Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scottish international Rory Hughes, ceded to the game by the Warriors, allowed the Melroses to take advantage of numerical superiority and Jason Baggot scored an unconverted trial.
Climo extended the Ayr's advantage with a penalty and, just in half, scored and converted an attempt to put the score 17-5 in favor of the Ayr at rest.
But the Melroses started off well in the second half and the Patrick Anderson rehearsal, converted by Baggot, reduced the differences to five points.
Afterwards, the game was interrupted for a long time due to the serious injury suffered by Ruaridh Knott, who retired in litter, and at the dam the Ayr again extended the distance with a Stafford McDowall trial converted by Climo.
Then, Deputy Captain Blair Macpherson was warned with a yellow card and, again, the Melroses took advantage of the superiority of one more man with an unconverted Bruce Colvine test at the end of a few moments of strong pressure.
However, the local team reacted and when Struan Hutchinson saw a yellow card to placate Climo without a ball, from the penalty lineup, MacPherson scored a counter-assassin behind the Ayr's penetrating pier.
Climo scored, as he had done almost since the dam, after Kyle Rowe picked up a shot from David Armstrong and passed the ball to the third line wing of Gregor Henry to score the local team's fifth try.
The star of the Still Game series seems to be ready to start a new career in the catering sector
Still-Game star Ford Kieran appears to be about to move into the hospitality industry after it is discovered that he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the character of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and co-stars with Greg Hemphill, his longtime comic partner.
The duo have announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, though a source in The Scottish Sun newspaper said Kiernan intended to enter Glasgow's "blossoming catering sector."
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, without coastline, expects the court to reopen the route to the Pacific
The sailors patrol through the ship's cargo-covered headquarters in La Paz.
The public buildings have a navy blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are embalmed with the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
“Recovering it is a duty.”
Across Bolivia's landlocked territory, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century remains very vivid, as is the desire to sail back across the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the deepest in decades, while Bolivia awaits the resolution that the International Court of Justice will issue on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the impetus, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, it goes without saying, expects the result with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the TIJ’s resolution on big screens across the country, with the hope that the Hague Court will rule in favor of Bolivia’s claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile is forced to negotiate the concession of a sovereign exit to the sea for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faces a polemic battle for re-election next year, also has many hopes set in Monday's resolution.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised last August.
However, some analysts think that it is unlikely that the Court will decide in favor of Bolivia and that, if it did, things would not change much.
The UN agency based in the Netherlands has no authority to award Chilean territory and has established that it will not determine the outcome of the possible talks.
The TIJ resolution, which comes just six months after the final allegations were filed, indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean specialist in international law.
And far from being favored, the cause of Bolivia may have experienced a setback in the past four years.
“The current Bolivian administration has kidnapped the issue of access to the sea,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
“Morales’ belligerent rhetoric has undermined any gesture of goodwill on the part of Chile,” he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold talks after this episode.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was exceptionally quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “an extraordinary opportunity to begin a new era of relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end 139 years of discrepancies, with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of Latin America's most popular presidents, was using the maritime issue as a political cross.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“Resolution is an opportunity to realize that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won’t happen unless it can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will not eliminate nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
The minister urged the United States to keep promises made during a summit held in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
His remarks come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to resume stalled nuclear diplomacy more than three months after a summit in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a chimera to think that continued sanctions and U.S. objections to a declaration ending the Korean War could make North Korea kneel.
Washington is hesitant to accept the declaration if Pyongyang does not make significant disarmament moves sooner.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang takes seriously the issue of giving up an arsenal that the country considers the only means to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris Fashion Shows Reveal The Latest Range Of Large Hats, On The Way To A Main Street Near You
If you want to increase the size of your hat collection or want to protect yourself completely from the sun, you don’t need to look for more.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the catwalk a range of extravagant hats of disproportionate dimensions from their SS19 collection, which dazzled the style defined at Paris Fashion Week.
This summer Instagram has been swept away by very impractical hats, and this designers have brought their amazing creations to the catwalk.
Valentino's highlight piece was an exaggerated beige hat, adorned with a wide, feather-shaped wing, which flooded the heads of the models.
Among other oversized accessories, there were jeweled hydrangeas, a witch hat, and even a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of extrafocal masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the brightly colored masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than no haute couture.
One creation resembled a complete scuba diving team, with tubes and glasses, while the other looked like a melted ice cone.
And if you follow the big fashion trends, you’re in luck.
Style observers predict that huge hats could be implanted in the main streets near you.
The large hats step on the heels of "The Bomb", a straw hat, with a two-foot wide wing, which everyone has worn, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the hat so impractical that it spread across social media brought another great creation to the catwalk: a straw bag for the beach, almost as big as the model dressed in a swimsuit wearing it.
The dark orange raffia bag, adorned with raffia chainsaws and finished with a white leather napkin, was the highlight of Jacquemus’s La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I hope to see people wearing big hats and beach bags on the main streets next summer. Considering that the designer has had a great impact, it would be a pity if the demand for large accessories were ignored.
John Edward: Language Competencies Are Essential for Global Citizens
Scotland’s independent schools maintain a track record of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another series of excellent exam results, which is reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to offer the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, for the career they choose and for their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a personalized school curriculum, we note that modern languages remain a matter of very popular and desired choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you will reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart.”
This is a very important reminder that we cannot depend only on English if we want to establish relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of this year’s exams, we can see that languages lead the ranking tables with the highest qualifications in independent schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved a higher A grade.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools, reflected that 72% of students obtained a higher A rating in Mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students also obtained an A rating.
This shows that Scotland’s independent schools support foreign languages as vital competencies that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, languages, as an elective subject, remain in the same consideration as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in curricula from independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted in 2014 by the UK’s Employment and Skills Commission revealed that of the reasons employers gave for the cost of covering vacancies, 17% were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly indispensable in preparing young people for their future careers.
Since there are more and more potential job opportunities that require languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with a permanent competition like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French, with 15% of speakers, was the only language with a double-digit percentage.
For this reason, investing in language learning is important for today’s children.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developed economies, will give children better opportunities to find an important job.
In Scotland, there is a diversity between schools as to the languages taught.
Some schools focus more on the more traditional modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be more important for the UK in the future, towards 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, you can always choose from a range of languages in independent schools, which have specialized teaching staff in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
In today’s global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages continue to be vitally important for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered “international communicative competences”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
You have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron to debut with Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The wait is practically over for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play his first pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But we still have to determine the minutes he will play.
“It’s going to be more than one and less than 48,” Walton told the Lakers.
Mike Trudell, a Lakers reporter, tweeted that James is likely to play a few minutes.
After early training this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
“I don’t need preseason games at this stage of my career to be ready,” he said.
Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a wave of campaigning tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump’s first of five meetings scheduled for next week, which include visits to sympathetic venues such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote for his candidate to fill the Supreme Court vacancy is on hold, Trump aims to gain support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia tonight and how can it be seen online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump’s meeting in West Virginia can be seen online at the link specified below, via live video streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address the hearing begun this week with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which was strained over allegations of sexual abuse he faces, while the Senate’s planned confirmation vote remains pending for up to a week and the FBI is investigating the case.
But the main objective of this wave of rallies is to help Republicans who run in the delicate November elections gain momentum.
The five meetings of President Trump’s campaign scheduled for next week are aimed at “encouraging volunteers and supporters, as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and in the House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
"Congressional control is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as he can, while we are heading for a busy campaign season," a Trump spokesman said in a statement.
This evening’s rally, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling, could bring together “Ohio and Pennsylvania sympathizers, and attract media coverage from Pittsburgh,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate, who is getting unfavorable results in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to give him a boost in the polls," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows its ambition to keep hopes alive in the face of individual matches on Sunday
After three unequal sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes were probably what this Ryder Cup needed.
The tilting pendulum of dynamics is an invented sports concept, in which players really believe, especially in competitions like this one.
So on which side is the positive dynamic now?
“They had a six-point lead and now it’s four, so I think we’re in a small positive streak,” Spieth said as he left at the end of the day.
Obviously, Europe has an advantage, four points ahead, with twelve more at stake.
Americans, as Spieth says, feel that the wind blows a little in their favor and have many reasons to be excited, largely by the shape-shifting state of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three four-pointers.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and is setting an example.
The guttural cries of celebration rose in intensity as he continued his turn and became a crucial putt to tie the fourth game, when he and Thomas had been two down after two holes.
He celebrated the putt that made them win the game at hole 15 with a similar shout, the kind that indicates that he believes the American team is not yet out of the competition.
“You have to do your best and worry about your own party,” Spieth said.
That’s all that’s left for these players.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed sensation of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple wear four out of four and make no mistakes.
"Moliwood" were the only couple who did not make a bogey Saturday afternoon, and also avoided the bogey Saturday morning and Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes Friday morning.
For this result and the way their energy seems to flow to and from the bustling public, it is reaffirmed that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and there is no player more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari to close a possible European victory as the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, to speak of European glory seemed premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly ended up with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourballs, who partnered with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes sunk the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole from which they never had any choice.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you out of the hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are very fascinating to see for the interactions between the gears, the tips they give and those they don’t give, and the way a strategy can change all of a sudden.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and will face the last day with a significant advantage, but this foursome session has shown that the U.S. team has the motivation to fight that some, especially in the U.S., had questioned.
Europe reaches the final of the Ryder Cup with a favorable score of 10-6
Europe will face the last day of the Ryder Cup with a comfortable lead after finishing the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday with a 10-6 win over the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made a great effort to achieve two victories against a struggling Tiger Woods and leave his record, so far, in four points at Le Golf National.
The European team, led by Thomas Bjorn, who aspired to retain the trophy he lost two years ago at Hazeltine, dominated a poorly-successful American team in the morning fourballs and put the series 3-1.
The U.S. showed more resistance to the foursomes and won two games, but could not reduce the differences.
Jim Furyk's team needed to score eight points in 12 individual games on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to score four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, known by the nickname "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair to win four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed on the fourballs, they made a brilliant performance to beat a deflated Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau for an even more iconic 5&4.
Woods, who had dragged himself into two games on Saturday, showed sporadic sparks of genius, but has lost 19 of 29 games in fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning fourballs, rejoined Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and fell 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, ranked first and third in the world, respectively.
However, Europe did not have it all on a pleasant and windy day south-west of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, three-time tournament champion, and Justin Thomas set a benchmark for Americans by scoring two points on Saturday.
They achieved a decisive 2–1 victory over Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and later won again Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4–3 in the foursomes, having lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup had a team rebounded a four-point difference in individual games, although the team of Furyk, defender of the title, only needs to tie to keep it.
However, after being the second best for two days, it seems that a next Sunday counterattack is out of reach.
North Korea says it will not unilaterally disarm "in no way" unless signs of confidence are noticed
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were intensifying its mistrust of the United States and that, under such circumstances, the country would not unilaterally eliminate its nuclear weapons in any way.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken "important goodwill measures" during the previous year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear testing center and committing not to proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
“However, we do not observe any response in accordance with the United States,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not unilaterally begin disarmament in any way.”
While Ri reiterated North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" denuclearization approach that North Korea would be rewarded for as it took steps gradually, his statements seemed significant because he had not rejected unilateral denuclearization in full.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim pledged to work on the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has tried to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted the call to relax tough international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
“The United States insists that denuclearization must first occur and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal coercively, in addition to opposing the “declaration of an end to the war,” Ri noted.
“The perception that sanctions will make us kneel is a chimera of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions are intensifying our mistrust.”
Ri did not refer to plans to hold a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the party involved in the denuclearization issue were South Korea instead of the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come from this situation."
However, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting U.S. territory with North Korean missiles was inevitable after President "Mr. Evil" Trump titled Kim "Rocket Man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said there is still much to do and sanctions must be maintained until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for this and that “it doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “the implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without exception until we confirm total and definitive denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to cut funding for Pyongyang's ballistic and nuclear missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and then announced that he would return to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go very well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, but within hours North Korea accused him of making "gangster's own demands."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile center and a nuclear complex if the United States took "measures in harmony."
He said Kim had told him that the “measures in line” he was seeking were the security measures Trump had promised in Singapore, as well as actions to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Take a Course on Resting Habits
This year, a new course at Harvard University has allowed its students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat the ever-expanding culture of studying all night long, stimulated by caffeine.
One academic noted that often the world’s number one university students are clueless about the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course after having a talk about the impact that sleep deprivation had on learning.
“At the end of the talk, a girl approached me and said, ‘Why are they telling me all this now, in my last year?’
He said that no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, implemented for the first time this year, explains to students the basic concepts about how good sleep habits improve academic and sports performance, in addition to overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after learning that some students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In a section there is an image of a bedroom, where students have to click on coffee cups, curtains, bamboo and books to receive information about the effects of caffeine and light, about how it affects sports performance in lack of sleep, and about the importance of maintaining a sleeping routine.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
Next, a campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily route.
“We know that the behavior of the students will not change immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know, as one has the right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes,” said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in staying awake all night still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the growing pressure that students are suffering from makes sleep deprivation an ever-increasing problem.
Making sure to enjoy good quality sleep for long enough should be a “secret weapon” for students to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he added, even to avoid gaining weight, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in inanimate mode and always makes students gain.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies Chemistry and Physical Biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after attending one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
Raymond commented that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote the course across the campus.
The next step, he expects, is to ask postgraduate students to undertake a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm when they go to sleep and when they wake up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can alter the harmony of circadian rhythm.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal ends with Gerrard's men
Dolly Menga's goal condemns Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1-0 loss at Livingston's home that means another run-off.
Ibrox's ensemble sought to add up their first home win since last February's 4–1 victory at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted the second defeat on Gerrard in 18 games as a coach to leave his team drifting, 8 points from the Hearts, the Premier's unstoppable leaders.
Menga scored the goal seven minutes before halftime, and it never seemed that the Rangers, uninspired, were about to equal the score.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston rise to third place, behind the Hibernian by goal difference.
And the Rangers could face further difficulties later, as line judge Calum Spence needed medical attention for a head injury caused by an object that apparently was thrown from the gradient.
Gerrard made eight changes to the lineup that wiped out the Ayrs in the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same eleven starter who kicked a point against the Hearts last week. Surely, he felt satisfied with the way his team, well-organized, suffocated his rivals at all times.
While the Rangers dominated possession, the Livingston created more danger when they had the ball.
In fact, they should have scored in the two minutes of the game, when Menga's first intervention left Scot Pittman alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder felt diverted and squandered the big opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs's bluntly missed pitch hit captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive comrade Alan Lithgow only made a deflected shot to the rear pole.
The Rangers took control, but seemed to have more hope than faith in their game in the third final.
Alfredo Morelos really believed he should have had a penalty on the fifteen-minute mark, as he and Steven Lawless hit, but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers only managed two goals in the first half, but Ibrox's first goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, had no problem with Lassana Coulibaly's header and the docile forward Ovie Ejaria.
While the first act of the Livi in the 34th minute could have been against the race, no one can deny that they deserved it just for their effort.
Again, the Rangers could not cope with Jacobs's hard-working move.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm to choose Menga for a single final.
Gerrard acted on the pause by changing Coulibaly to Ryan Kent. The change had a near-immediate impact, as the extreme made a pass at Morelos, although the imposing Kelly ran to the blockade.
However, the Livingstons continued to grab visitors' attention by playing exactly as they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett making long passes, one after the other.
Holt's band may have yielded direction in the final stages, but McGregor remained firm in rejecting Jacobs before Lithgow made a deflection from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton still requested a final penalty for a dispute with Jacobs, but again Thomson turned a blind eye.

And now a page of the "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and counting... the day the physicist of the future, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually gave rise to the device we know as the "Geiger counter".
The Geiger counter, which has been a pillar of science ever since, also became a staple of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, seemingly failed cowboy physicists:
Man: "What inside is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can hear the effects of the atoms that emanate from radioactivity to minerals."
Evans: "I'm sure it's exploding now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Your Immune System to ‘See’ Malignant Cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” and remove malignant cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of the treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
You can "see" a common protein in many cancers and then re-inject them
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with various types of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw the ovarian cancer that she suffered from for more than 18 months disappear.
The method involves extracting a patient's immune cells, altering them in the laboratory to be able to "see" a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2), and subsequently re-injecting them.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, USA: “The results we have obtained suggest that we have a promising vaccine.”
The HER2 protein "favours the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach consisting of extracting immune cells from patients and "teaching" these cells how to treat cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West was embroiled in a pro-Trump diatribe with a MAGA cap after his performance on the SNL program.
It didn't end well
Kanye West was written into the studio during Saturday Night Live after a chaotic performance in which he congratulated U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run in the 2020 election.
After his third song of the night, titled Ghost Town, in which he wore a Make America Great Again cap, he began to criticize Democrats and reiterate his support for Trump.
“Every time I talk to white people, they say to me, ‘How can you like Trump if he’s racist?’
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL program began with a parody of Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee for allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it did not air, comedian Chris Rock uploaded the recording of West's disapproval to social media.
It is unclear whether Rock intended to ridicule West with the publication.
However, West has complained to the public that he was not well treated behind the scenes because of the cap he was wearing.
"They threatened me behind the scenes.
I was told not to go out with that hat on.
I've been sacked.
And then they say I'm in a lower position," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the bottom position?" as he said that he would put on Superman's cloak so they wouldn't be able to tell him what to do. "Do you want the world to move forward?
“Try to love.”
His comments provoked audience scribblers at least twice and the program's crew seemed embarrassed, according to Variety, who had a reporter who told the publication: "The entire studio was completely silent."
West took over as a last-minute replacement for Ariana Grande, whose former rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West left much of the audience perplexed with the performance of the song I Love It, disguised as Perrier's bottle.
West got the support of the head of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR STANDING BETWEEN THE MULTITUDE."
But the host of the debate program, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was simply "being who he is and that he is absolutely wonderful."
“But I have chosen not to reward someone (by buying their music or clothing or supporting their ‘art’) who I believe adopts and spreads an ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
And so are we,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and was now "the formerly known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, was previously called Snoop Lion and the missing music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and later the artist formerly known as Prince.
Murder charge in attempted stabbing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder following the stabbing of a man Friday in east Belfast.
According to police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Court of First Instance on Monday.
The prosecutor will review the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington denounces toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for portraying the role of swordsman Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor has denounced the stereotype of a male hero, stating that these roles make it clear that young boys often believe they must be strong to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times' Culture magazine, Kit said she believed "something had gone wrong" and was questioning how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who has recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, has admitted that she is determined to deal with this problem.
"Personally, I'm now wondering where we've been wrong in terms of masculinity," he says.
"What have we taught men during their development in relation to the problem we are experiencing now?"
According to Kit, television can be part of the responsibility for increasing toxic masculinity thanks to its so masculine characters.
He added: “What is innate and what is acquired?
What is being taught on television and in the streets that makes young boys feel that they should have this facet of virility?
I think that’s one of the big questions of our time: how do we change it?
“Something has been done wrong with the kids.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would make no prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones when the series' end is scheduled for next summer, all saying he's fed up with battles and horses.
Starting in November, Kit will star in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his partner Rose is the best that Game of Thrones has provided him.
"I met my wife on the show, so she gave me my future family and my life ahead," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family farm in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China announces 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health officials.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases are of sexual transmission, unlike what happened in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some regions of China due to infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people contracting HIV for this cause has dropped to almost zero, according to statements by Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community is common.
Taking into account the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men who have homosexual relations will end up marrying a woman.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are due to the lack of adequate precautions for sexual intercourse.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has leaked data from Republican senators and dismantles “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her staff had published personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed the demands were driven by critics and far-right websites.
"Liars, lies and more despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information allegedly contained the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and was published by an unknown person in the Capitol during a session of the Senate committee on allegations of sexual abuse against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was related to Waters' office and that it revealed information from a Waters staff member, the Capitol reported.
“This unsubstantiated denunciation is completely false and a pure lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff, the identity, personal data and security of which have been compromised due to these false and fraudulent allegations, was not in any way responsible for this leakage of information.
This unsubstantiated denunciation is completely false and a pure invention.”
Waters' statement quickly generated online criticism, including that of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is full of indignation,” Fleischer wrote.
“It makes you think you don’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they have not done, they should not be angry.
It doesn’t have to be challenging.
You don't have to question the accuser's motives.
You have to be calm and serene.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters's reaction to criticism from Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, who critics accused of appearing too angry during Thursday's session.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who ran to topple Waters in midterm elections, also voiced his opinion on Twitter.
“It doesn’t matter if it’s true,” he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted relevant authorities and security forces to these fraudulent statements.
“We will ensure that the criminals are revealed, and that they will be held legally responsible for all the actions that they have carried out and that have harmed each and every member of my staff.”
Johnny English Strikes Again: Rowan Atkinson's Limited Spy Parody
It is already tradition to look for references to Brexit in any new film with a British approach, and this rendition of the Johnny English action-comedy parody franchise, which was born in 2003 with Johnny English and reappeared in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, is no exception.
This humorous self-satisfaction about how despicable we are will be a new export opportunity for the country?
In any case, the incompetent eyes and rubber face Johnny English has been able to renew for the second time his license to twist it all. His name indicates more than anything that it is a comic creation designed for non-English speaking territories with a tradition of going to the cinema.
Evidently, he is the stupid secret agent who, despite his rare claims of liquefied glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a Mr. Bean dot and a touch of this guy who brings a single note to the theme of Fireworks at the inaugural ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
Originally, it was based on the international and mysterious traveler Atkinson who represented Barclaycard's now-forgotten television ads, where he was sowing chaos everywhere.
There are one or two good moments in this last journey of IE.
I loved Johnny English approaching a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and the blades of the propeller echoed to his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is seen, but humor seems rather fluid and strangely superfluous, especially because "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now include comedy as an ingredient.
Humor seems to be aimed at children rather than adults and, to me, Johnny English’s absurd adventures are not as ingenious or focused as the mute gags of Mr. Bean’s character Atkinson.
The recurring premise now is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated the British network of supersecret web spies and has revealed the identities of all British agents on the ground, causing the service agent's consternation, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last resort for a prime minister who is a pretentious and beleaguered figure, who already suffers a total collapse of lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this slick character of Teresa-May, but the script does not come up any further.
His intelligence advisers inform him that, as each active spy is put in danger, he will have to recover some of his retirement.
And that includes the sinister Johnny English, now employed as a professor at some luxury institution, but giving off-the-shelf classes on how to become a covert agent, with some good gags, such as when English offers a spy academy that looks like a rock school.
English is quickly returned to Whitehall for an emergency meeting with his suffering sequester Bough, a role that once again represents Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, tied to the commander of a submarine, an enthusiastic role, in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little untapped.
Thus, Batman and Robin from when things get very ugly in Her Majesty's secret service come into action once again and find Olga Kurylenko the spectacular "femme fatale" Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the spell of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, represented by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous madness: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French fast food restaurant, they seem to be in chaos by smuggling aboard the luxury yacht of Volta and English causes a great deal of confusion when trying to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize themselves with the house of Volta.
All the stops have certainly been extracted from this last sequence, but with all the simplicity and noise it presents, everything seems like a children's program.
Quite normal stuff.
As with the other Johnny English films, it has not been helpful to think about whether the film industry has given Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is devising a plan for the British to have a four-day working week and cover five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party will have to consider a radical plan under which the British will work four days a week and charge five.
Supposedly, the party wants business leaders to pass on the savings made with the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution to the workers by giving them one more day of partying.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but would receive the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea would fit with the economic agenda of the parties and plans to tilt the country in favor of the workers.
The four-day shift to a week’s work is supported by Trades Union Congress as a method for workers to benefit from economic change.
An experienced Labour source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It will not be overnight, but a four-day working week is an aspiration that fits into the party’s perspective of balancing the economy in favor of the worker and into the party’s overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not support this aspiration in a joint way at the present time.
A Labour spokesman said: “A four-day working week is not party politics and the party is not considering it.”
Shadow Minister John McDonnell used last week's party conference to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell expressed his determination to restore the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" to public service companies.
The minister’s plans in the shadows also imply that shareholders of water companies might not recover the entire investment, as the Labour government could apply “deductions” for the crimes it perceives.
It has also confirmed plans to place workers on corporate boards and create inclusive ownership funds to deliver 10% of the shares of private sector firms to employees, who expect to pocket annual dividends worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy explains to "60 Minutes" if the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation could make them change their minds.
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court for at least a week, and has raised the question of whether the agency’s findings could influence any Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be published Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring something to light that made them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina colleague.
"I'm serious," Kennedy said.
“I said at the session that I had spoken with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it all happened and the accusations were made public, and I asked him if he had done it.
He was strong, determined, and confident.”
But Graham's voice seems to be on fire.
"I have my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and would file an explosive indictment," he said.
"Mrs. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett absolutely denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"None of the people I'm naming will be able to verify it.
He's 36 years old.
I don’t see anything changing again.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Has it done anything to reduce poverty?
New York City will host this Saturday the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event, featuring an absolutely impressive star program, who carry out an equally impressive mission: eradicating poverty in the world.
At the seventh edition this year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people gather in the Great Lawn area of Central Park not only to enjoy performances such as those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to awaken awareness of the global goal of the 20th anniversary event.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who help fight it actively.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless someone wants to pay for a VIP ticket), attendees had to do a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other activity to raise awareness about the subject.
What successes has Global Citizen achieved now that it has 12 years to reach its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a good way to persuade them to demand a call to action or simply a case more than what we call "criminalism" (people who think it makes a difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its sympathizers, which have helped achieve various goals.
It states that these actions have helped spur global leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which will have influenced the lives of more than 2.2 billion people before 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements derived from its shares, of which at least US$10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that currently protected funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition Foundation, a UK-based association of investors and performers, which pledges to “help children grow as much as possible” and promises to send $35 million to Rwanda to help combat malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and members of Global Citizens, like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote in history,” The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in 2018.
The group also explained that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the funding of a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of her website’s P+Fs asking “what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”,
Global Citizen replied, "It will be a long and hard road. Sometimes, we will fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will triumph, because together we are stronger.”
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York, featuring Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a "blockade" to hinder Russian energy exports (Secretary of the Interior)
Washington can, “if necessary,” resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting markets, including those in the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke has denounced Russia’s intervention in Syria, mainly where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government, as a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think the reason they are in the Middle East is their willingness to negotiate with energy, as they already do in Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to address this issue.
"The United States has the capacity, along with the Navy, to ensure that shipping lanes are open and, if necessary, to blockage, to prevent its energy from entering the market," he said.
Zinke addressed attendees at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that defines itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the U.S.
He compared Washington’s strategies for negotiating with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are indeed equal.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to take advantage of and replace fuels," he said, pointing out that Russia has only one resource, as its economy depends on fossil fuels.
The statements come as the Trump administration has been on a mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the most economical option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to exit the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which Trump said turned Berlin into a “captive” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which has cost $11 billion and will double the existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is simply due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. stance has prompted a negative response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's main industry organisation, the FDI (Federation of German Industries), has called on the US to move away from the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the BDI (Federation of German Industries) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will "deliberately consider" her candidacy for the presidency in 2020.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "deliberately consider" her candidacy for the presidency after the midterm elections.
During a municipal meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
“The time has come for women to go to Washington and fix the government fracture, for women to hold high positions,” he said.
"After November 6, I will take my candidacy for president seriously."
Warren spoke about President Donald Trump during the town hall meeting and said he was "bringing the country in the wrong direction."
“I am genuinely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing in our democracy,” he said.
Warren has been frank in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "It's clear that an FBI investigation is needed before the election."
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters believed he should not run for office by 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "probable" voters have said the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The poll revealed broader support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor of a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile names among Democrats that were considered in connection with a possible 2020 candidacy include Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially reveal his decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin cites the affected for TEPT Track Palin at the meeting of Donald Trump
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after enrolling on September 11, 2007
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence.
“With what my own son has been going through since he came back, I can understand other families suffering from the ramifications of PTSD and some of the emotional wounds our soldiers are returning with,” he told the audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said the following of his son and other war veterans: "They become a little different, they become hardened, they come back wondering if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, as well as any other member of the army, have given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, with a statement for domestic violence and possession of weapons under the effects of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and DC support the challenge to a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence
Representatives from 18 states and the district presented a curiae friend in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker who challenged the policy, according to NBC News.
The full name of the Grace vs Sessions lawsuit that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and the children of the violent gang member" assaulted her, but U.S. officials denied her request for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers from Grace-supporting states have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a large number of asylum seekers are generated in the U.S., as countries facing widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy repealed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals, which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to seek asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation."
Federal laws require asylum claims to be adjudicated according to the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and this prohibition violates this principle, according to the amicus curiae.
Lawyers also argued in the report that the policy that denies entry of immigrants harms the U.S. economy, as they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary jobs."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant more asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs.
"Asylum is available to those people who leave their country for persecution or fear for reasons of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in its June 11 announcement of the policy.
Asylum has never sought to alleviate all the problems, not even the most serious, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as human losses multiply in a sprint to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is becoming increasingly desperate.
"The environment is very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she reassured her fever-stricken son in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute, an ambulance carries bodies.
“There is no drinking water.”
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes to grab flooded belongings and try to save what they can.
There are hundreds of wounded, and hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 quake, are saturated.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who has fractured his shoulder, are outside Palu military hospital, as patients are treated outside due to the strong repetitive shakings.
Tears shook his eyes as he explained how the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save us.
He was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had attended a wedding in the village.
“I heard my wife cry for help and then I didn’t hear her anymore.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're okay."
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of harassing it with “propaganda ads.”
A week after an official Chinese publication published a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper promoting the mutual advantages of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China has accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump addressed China Daily’s payment supplement to The Des Moines Register, the state of Iowa’s best-selling newspaper, on Wednesday after accusing China of interfering in the November 6 U.S. Congressional elections, a charge China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US election marked what U.S. officials have told Reuters is a new phase of Washington’s campaign to intensify pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a trade war that is intensifying and has seen tariffs on mutual imports.
China's vengeful tariffs at the start of the trade war were aimed at punishing exporters from states such as Iowa who backed Trump's Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa for a long time, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed workers, farmers and U.S. companies.
China, Branstad wrote in an op-ed in The Des Moines Register of The Sunday: "It is redoubling harassment with the publication of propaganda ads in our free press."
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the esteemed American tradition of free speech and free press by inserting a payment ad in The Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“Instead, at the kiosk down the street here in Beijing, you will find few dissenting voices and you will not see any real reflection of the disparate opinions Chinese citizens may have about China’s worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is dominated by the Chinese Communist Party,” he said.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers was dodging the offer to publish" his article, but did not say the name of the publication.
Republicans cut off women’s voters ahead of midterm elections with Kavanaugh disaster, analysts warn
With many leading Republicans supporting and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who faces multiple sexual assault claims, analysts have warned that they will see a negative response, especially among women, to the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this case are extremely high and most Republicans already officially show that they want to take a step forward with a vote.
These things can't be undone," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse's Maxwell School, told The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that last-minute pressure from Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation is enough to calm angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, neither tomorrow nor in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman for progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, Protestants shouted "November is coming!" (November is approaching) as they demonstrated in the Senate lobby while Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee decided to continue Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to the Mic.
“Democrats’ enthusiasm and motivation will be out of the picture,” said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst at the news site.
“People say they’ve already been tall; it’s true.
But there could have been more, especially among the voters of suburban women and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who often don’t vote while they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, detailing his sexual assault claims to the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested a negative response could occur if Republicans pressed for confirmation.
"This has become an embarrassment for the GOP," Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the board vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh sits on the defendants' bench. It's also about how Republicans have handled this issue and how they have treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, on the news channel.
However, Americans appear to be divided between those who believe in the Ford star and Kavanaugh's witnesses, with the scale leaning slightly toward the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents unquestionably or likely believe in Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent say unquestionably or likely believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed that Kavanaugh had probably or undoubtedly lied during his testimony, while 30 percent said the same was true of Ford.
Following Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating claims by Ford and at least one other whistleblower, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted him under the effects of alcohol when he was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed him the genitals at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web, is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that is based on Berners-Lee’s Solid open source platform.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people can access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's occult intent was "to dominate the world."
"We have to do it now," he said of the emerging company.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid platform technology to allow users to create their own “personal online data warehouse” or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify. They're all available in one browser at a time.
What is exclusive of the online store of personal data is that it is the user who decides who can access certain information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
Inrupt’s idea, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, is for the company to integrate appropriate resources, processes and skills to make the Solid platform available to everyone.
The company is currently made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some on-the-job developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer encoders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that none of his team is talking to “Facebook and Google about whether it is necessary to introduce a radical change where all business models are completely emptied during the night.
“We’re not asking for permission.”
In a Saturday publication on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web integrated into the Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate about net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the clergy of the Victory Cross of the I GM
The only church clergy in England who won a Victory Cross during World War I as a fighter has been honored in their hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann obtained the award on 29 September 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was shot by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the most important British military honor.
His two grandchildren unearthed a memorial stone at a parade Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" that the tombstone was presented exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning feat.
According to The London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog and under the intense fire of cannons and machine guns".
He later ran toward the line of fire and, with the "maximum courage" advanced the line before throwing himself on a cannon with one hand and leaving three members of the detachment stunned.
The lieutenant colonel was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were a feat that could never be matched, giving you a sense of humility.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also left a crown after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honored to be part of the parade and added that the value of an authentic hero is demonstrated by the support he will receive from many people.
MMA fans who stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206, saw Peppa Pig instead
Imagine staying up all night to watch Bellator 206 and being denied seeing the most important event.
The San Jose poster contained 13 fights, including six from the main card and were to be seen live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 p.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the confrontation, UK spectators were stunned when the programming changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disgusted to have spent the night awake until morning to watch the fight.
A Twitter follower described the change for the cartoons as "a kind of vomiting accent."
"Government regulations say that at 6:00 this content is not appropriate, so they switched to children's programming," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pork, yes."
Bellator president Scott Coker said they would work on programming to include UK viewers in the future.
“I think when I think about repetition, I think it can work,” Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday and we can't solve it until Sunday at our own time, Monday at his.
But we are working there.
Believe me, when I switched channels, there were a lot of messages coming and going, and not all of them were nice.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't. It was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen again.
We'll leave it in five fights, instead of six as we normally do. We tried to show it again to the fans, but it was over.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels ‘Lower’ About Sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to the rest of the people because of his sexuality, but that this provided him with the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete has stated that he did not realize until he went to high school that not everyone was like him.
On Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne, she said she was talking about gay rights to give "hope" to other people.
He also said that being a father was important to him in winning the Olympic Games.
The regular host of the long-running program, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off for illness.
Daley, who appeared as a nuisance in Laverne's first show, said he felt "less than" others because "it was not socially acceptable like boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, those feelings of inferiority and difference have been real things that have given me the power and strength to triumph.”
He wanted to prove it was “something,” he said, so as not to disappoint anyone when he ended up discovering his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile promoter of the LGBT movement and has used his image at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he had spoken because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and that he wanted to give “hope” to other people.
The three-time world champion explained that he had fallen in love with a man, American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "taken me by surprise".
Last year, Daley married the Oscar winner, 20 years older than him, but says the age difference has never been a problem.
According to him, when you pass by when you are young (you participated in your first Olympic Games when you were 14 years old and your father died of cancer three years later), it is difficult to find someone of the same age who has experienced similar highs and lows.
The couple were parents in June of a child they named Robert Ray Black-Daley. According to Daley, "his whole perspective" has changed.
“If you had asked me last year, all I needed to do was win an Olympic gold medal,” he said.
“There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
“My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son is said to be the same as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
According to Daley, his father did not accept that he should die and one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t say, ‘Dad, you’re not going to be in the front row,’” he said.
“As I held his hand, he stopped breathing and it wasn’t until then that he was already dead that I finally accepted that he was not invincible,” she said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze medal.
"I knew that was what I'd dreamed of all my life: jumping in front of a crowd at home at some Olympics. There was no better feeling," he said.
He also inspired the selection of his first song (Heather Small's Proud), which he had listened to during preparation for the Olympics and which still put on his chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson to compete in Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will break a record Sunday in his 47th Ryder Cup game, but will have to change his physical condition if he doesn’t want to become an unlucky hit.
Mickelson, who will participate in the biennial event to break a record for the 12th time, was introduced by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's "fourballs" and "foursomes" modalities.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as has usually been for the United States, the winner of five major tournaments divides his time between becoming an animator and working on his game on the field, hoping to rectify what hurts him.
He has never made the drivers more direct, not even at the height of his career, but the 48-year-old is not the ideal option for Le Golf National's difficult career, where the long rough is used to punish the diverted shots.
And if his own career isn’t discouraging enough, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth game, will face the exact British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, who has joined rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, four points down at the start of the 12 individual games, start strong, Mickelson’s party could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, without being able to say much more.
“He perfectly understood his role that day, slapped me on the back and surrounded me with his arm as he told me I would be ready the next day,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It is a hall of fame and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn’t see him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that's how I trained and that's how we thought we had to move forward.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo’s record for the most Ryder Cup matches played.
It can mean the end of a Ryder Cup race that has not matched its individual record.
Mickelson has scored 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 draws, although Furyk has stated that his presence has brought intangibles to the team.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s a joker, he likes to make fun of people and he’s a great teammate.”
"I think the younger players also had a lot of fun hanging out with him this week, which was fun to see.
It adds a lot more to your game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the advantage may fade soon
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that starting with a considerable advantage the individual duels of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a tough day.
The Dane made his debut in 1997 at Valderrama, when the team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the American team, but in the end they achieved the win by a minimum of 14.5-13.5.
"And keep remembering that we had a big advantage in Valderrama; we had a big advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but for a while," said Bjorn, in the image, after seeing the team's victory of 2018 by 5-3 both Friday and 10th at the National Golf, which he left yesterday.
“History has taught me and all the members of the team that it’s not over yet.
We have to go to the whole machine tomorrow.
You have to go out and do everything right.
This does not end until the points reach the marker.
We have a goal, try to win the trophy, and we have to keep the concentration to do it.
I’ve said it before, I focus on the 12 players we have in the team, but I also have in mind who our rivals are: the best players in the world.”
Fascinated by the performance of his players on a demanding golf course, Bjorn added: "I will never rush with this.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow’s performance will make a difference and change everything.
It’s great to be there with a partner when everything goes well, but individual duels put your golfing ability to the test.
This is the message you have to convey to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
At this point, you leave your partner and he has to go out and get the best out of himself as well.”
In opposition to Bjorn, rival captain Jim Furyk hopes his players will perform better individually than as a team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk knows both sides of the coin about last-day payouts, as he was part of the winning team at Brookline before ending up losing in the "Miracle of Medinah" that won Europe.
"I remember exactly all the words," he said in response to the question about how he motivated Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, his players before the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but we want to start with a good footing, as we saw in Brookline and Medinah.
When there is a team that is inspired, a lot of pressure is generated in these central duels.
We have prepared the alignment according to the circumstances and the best way to try to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas is challenged to try to start the rebound against Rory McIlroy in the main duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the rest of the Europeans in the first half of the order.
“I chose this order because I think it covers all possibilities,” says Bjorn about his selection for individual confrontations.
Germany's new warship, postponed again
The new German Navy frigate should have been completed in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era warships, but it will not do so until at least next year due to faulty systems and an increase in cost, according to local media.
The completion of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the flagship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but post-construction problems have marked the deadlines for this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships commissioned by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is believed to include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as stealth-action technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other highlights include longer maintenance periods: it should be possible to use the new frigates for up to two years without going through national ports.
However, these continued delays imply that the avant-garde ships, which were expected to project into Germany as a powerful force abroad, will already be obsolete when they enter service, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate was already in the news last year, when the German Navy rejected the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the builder once it had been delivered.
Few details of the reasons for its return are known, but German media have cited several "material and technical defects" of the ship that rendered it unusable if used in combat missions.
The technical problems are significant, as about 120 sailors, half of the crew needed for the old Bremen-class frigates, operate on Baden-Württemberg-class ships.
In addition, it has also been known that the ship's weight is excessive, as it reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future improvements.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz will weigh twice as much as similar-class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defective materials, the cost of the project, which includes the training of the crew, also begins to pose a problem.
It is believed to have reached an astonishing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) from an initial budget of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems of the new frigates have become a matter of particular importance, given the recent warnings that Germany's naval military power is being weakened.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defense committee of the German Parliament, acknowledged that the Navy "is running out of ships that can be used."
The officer has stated that the situation has deteriorated over time because the old ships were discontinued, but no new ones were provided as a replacement.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Foundation spies on the secret life of bats
A new research carried out on a farm in the Scottish Highlands aims to discover how bats use the landscape to feed themselves.
The findings are expected to provide new data on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help in future conservation activities.
The study of scientists from the National Foundation of Scotland will follow soprano and common bats, as well as northern eardrums and water bats in the Botanical Garden of Inverewe, located in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations of the property to monitor the activities of bats during the season.
Volunteers and staff from the UK National Health Service will also conduct mobile surveys with portable detectors.
The analysis of the sound of the recordings by experts will determine the sound frequency of the bats and what each species does.
With this information, a report and a map of the habitat will be created to create a detailed image on a scale of the landscape of your behavior.
Rob Dewar, natural conservation adviser at the National Foundation of Scotland, hopes the results will show which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as creating meadows, and how to improve the maintenance of forests for bats and other associated species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom has declined considerably in the last century.
The construction and restoration of buildings threaten the bats, as they affect the nests and can cause habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose a risk, as do paper-killing masks and chemical treatments used in building materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
In fact, cats are not blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they have to catch a prey.
They use a sophisticated echo location technique to locate insects and obstacles that interfere with their flight.
The National Foundation of Scotland, responsible for taking care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten experts with appropriate training, who conduct surveys, nest inspections and, sometimes, rescues on a regular basis.
The organisation has even created Scotland's first and only bat reserve on the Threave Estate, located in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The farm's administrator, David Thompson, claims that it is the ideal territory for the species.
“Here at Threave, we have a large area for bats,” he says.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and a good habitat.
But we still don’t know many aspects of bats, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to grow.”
It notes the importance of checking for bats before doing property maintenance tasks, as it may be that the possible unintentional destruction of a single maternity nest kills more than 400 females and young people, which could lead to the disappearance of an entire local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, attack them, disturb them and destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an official of the Scottish Bat Conservation Foundation, has encouraged people to take a step forward to help.
He said: “We still have a lot to learn from bats and, in the case of some of our species, we don’t have enough data on their population.”
Ronaldo denies rape allegations as his lawyers prepare lawsuit against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo said the allegations of rape against him were "fake news" and that people "want to become famous" because of his name.
His lawyers will sue the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, which is responsible for publishing the allegations.
The Portugal forward and Juventus have been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid $375,000 at the time for the incident not to be made public, according to information published Friday by Der Spiegel.
In a video on Instagram Live in which he addressed his 142 million followers hours after the accusations went public, Ronaldo, 33, claimed they were "fake news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today, fake news,” says the five-time Golden Ball winner on camera.
“They want to be famous because of my name.
It's normal.
They want to use my name to make themselves famous, but it’s part of my job.
I’m a happy man and everything is in order,” added the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are already preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel over the charges, which they have called "inadmissible information of suspicions about privacy," according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz has said the player will seek compensation for "moral damages for an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most flagrant personal rights infringements in recent years."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to reports filed in Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo kneeled down after the alleged incident and told him he was a "99% good boy", except for a "1%".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but were consented.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and was photographed in the hospital, but later accepted an out-of-court deal because she was "fearful of retaliation" and worried "to be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she is trying to cancel the deal, as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to score for Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged incident and this summer he has scored for Juve, the Italian giant, in a 100 million-euro operation.
Brexit: UK ‘would always regret’ losing car makers
The UK would “always regret” losing its status as a world leader in manufacturing after Brexit, according to Greg Clark, Secretary of Economic Affairs.
He added that it was "concerned" that Toyota's UK base had told the BBC that if the UK left the European Union without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
“We need an agreement,” Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer has indicated that the impact of delays at borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cause job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that if the UK leaves the EU without an agreement at the end of March, production will stop at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, managing director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Leaving the EU without any agreement on how trade with the rest of the EU countries will work has aroused the fears of other car manufacturers in the UK, such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close the Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what manufacturers consider risks in the production chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is made on a "just in time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers from the UK and the European Union for the manufacture of automobiles.
If the UK leaves the European Union without reaching an agreement on March 29, there may be disturbances at the border, which the sector believes could lead to delays and shortages of fish.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, according to the company, and production would have to stop as a result.
Clark says Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls.”
"We have to reach an agreement. We want to get the best deal that allows us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
“The tests, not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, indicate that we need to be able to continue with a successful set of production chains.”
Toyota has not been able to confirm how long production would stop, but in the long run, it has warned that the added costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and could cause job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite the Union coordinator at the plant, said members are starting to be very concerned about the situation: "From experience, when these jobs are lost, they never come back."
A government spokesman said: "We have designed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
According to the White House, the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be delayed again
Donald Trump's long-awaited meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be "postponed a week" as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, in White House statements Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, links between Russia and Trump aid, and a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump dismisses the deputy attorney general and jeopardizes Mueller’s independence has fueled rumors in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and also the possibility of deposing the president with the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he went to the White House amid rumors that he was about to resign.
However, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to dismiss Rosenstein, but postponed the meeting to avoid a confrontation with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing at which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the entire Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: "No date has yet been set, it could be this week, although it may be one more week late for all matters with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see. I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists may refute this claim: Sanders has not held any White House briefings since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the lack of informative sessions was not because he did not like the fanfare of television journalists, although he said: "I will not deny that they are fanfare".
He then hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president does more question and answer sessions than any previous president,” he said, before adding the following without citing any source: “We have consulted this data.”
Sanders has stated that the briefings will continue to take place, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask directly to the president of the United States, it's much infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do it often, you’ve seen us do it a lot in the last few weeks and they will replace the briefings when you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with dignitaries on an official visit.
Individual press wheels are uncommon.
This week, in New York, the president may have shown why, after an informal appearance and, at times, strange in front of the assembled journalists.
The Secretary of Health writes to the EU workers of the Scottish National Health Service following the fears of Brexit
The Secretary of Health has written to EU staff working at the Scottish National Health Service to express the country’s gratitude and wishes them to continue there after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months after the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to cover the cost of state residency applications for EU citizens working in delegated public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union on the exit have continued, and everything seems to be heading towards the decisions expected this fall.
But the UK government has also begun preparations in the event of a possible no-deal scenario.
I know it’s a busy time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to reiterate now that I greatly appreciate the contribution of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
EU colleagues, and beyond, provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, while benefiting the patients and the communities we treat.
“Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing an emergency operation after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers relegator Christion Abercrombie has undergone an emergency operation after suffering a head injury Saturday in a 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to information from Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed has told the press that the injury occurred shortly before halfway through.
“He came to the front line and he collapsed there,” Reed said.
The trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen to the band before placing him in a bunker and taking him away for further testing.
A Tennessee State officer has informed Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the Vanderbilt Medical Center as a surgeon.
Harris added that "there is still no information on the type or extent of the injury" and Tennessee State is investigating when the injury occurred.
It is the first season of second-year Abercrombie with Tennessee State after signing from Illinois.
He had completed five pitches on Saturday before leaving the game, making a total of 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher timbre tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher toll tax when buying a property in the UK with the additional money used to help homeless people under the new Conservative Party plans.
This action will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s movement to attract young voters.
The increase in the stamp tax will be taxed on those people who do not pay taxes in the UK.
Hesenda hopes to get up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers are expected to be charged a higher toll tax on buying a property in the UK and this money will be used to help homeless people, a measure Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s movement to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing that would affect higher incomes.
The increase in the toll tax will be levied on those people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK; this money will be spent on government action to combat the numbers of homeless people.
The surcharge, which will be added to the current timbre tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago in second residences and real estate speculation, could be up to 3%.
Hisenda expects to get up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are from non-British residents, which increases prices and makes it difficult for new buyers to open up to the property scale.
Many prosperous areas of the country, especially the capital, have become "ghost cities" as a result of the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
The new measure comes weeks after Boris Johnson has called for a reduction in the toll tax to help young people have their first home.
He accused the large constructions of keeping property prices high by buying land quickly and not using it, and urged May to cancel quotas on affordable homes to correct Britain's "real estate disaster".
Corbyn has announced a series of attractive proposed real estate reforms, such as rental controls and the completion of “no-fault” denunciations.
He also wants to give more power to councils to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream: life must improve for every new generation.
And that means correcting our broken real estate market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and create a life here.
However, it can’t be right that it’s just as easy for people who don’t live in the UK, as it is for companies based abroad, to buy housing compared to hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is too distant and the indignity of homeless people makes it all even more real.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to coach Scotland"
Sunderland coach Jack Ross has said his "highest ambition" is to be Scotland's coach at some point.
The 42-year-old has accepted the challenge of reviving the northeastern club, which currently holds the third position in League One, three points from the leader.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after returning the St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
I was once called in as support and that’s it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportssound programme.
“But I grew up watching a lot of Scotland play at Hampden with my father when I was a kid and it’s always something that takes me back in time.
This opportunity will only come to me if I succeed in coaching clubs, however.”
Ross's predecessors in the Sunderland coaching position included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The Alloa Athletic coach says he doesn't feel the pressure to be next on a list of names in such a large team, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For now, my criterion for measuring my success will be if I can get this team back into the Premier League.
With the structure and facilities of the club, it is clear that its place is in the Premier League."
"It's not easy to get there, but I would only consider myself successful here if I could bring the club back."
Ross has only three years of experience as a coach, after a period as a second coach at Dumbarton and 15 months at the Hearts technical corps.
He helped the Alloa avoid descending into the third category and transformed the St Mirren from fighting for salvation to Championship champions the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than during his time as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a decisive moment," he recalled about accepting the post at Alloa.
“I’ve always believed that training was the best thing I could do, rather than playing.
It sounds strange because I did it right, I came out reasonably and enjoyed enough good moments algids.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things you have to overcome every week.
I still do it in aspects like the stress and pressure of the job, but I feel good as a coach.
I’ve always wanted to train and now I’m doing it, it’s the most comfortable time I’ve felt since I was an adult.”

The summer heatwave has triggered consumption in troubled bars in Britain, but it has added more pressure to restaurant chains.
Bars and chain bars saw a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but consumption in restaurants has decreased by 4.8%, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, from CGA’s financial advisor, the company that collected the data, said: “The continuous hours of sunshine and England’s participation in the World Cup, which has expanded more than expected, have made July hit a similar pattern to June, with the increase of 2.8% in restaurants.
The 1.8% reduction in consumption in restaurants in June has worsened in July.
Bars and taverns, led by the consumption of drinks, have achieved the best results, while consumption in restaurants has gone down.
The bars that offer food have also suffered from the sun, although it has not been as dramatic as in the case of restaurants.
People just wanted to go out and drink.
In the bars and taverns we consulted, beverage sales increased by 6.6% during the month, while food sales decreased by 3%.
Paul Newman, of RSM leisure and hospitality analysts, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sporting events continue to be the main factors related to sales of the outdoor leisure market.
It’s no surprise that restaurants continue to have problems, but a 4.8% decline in sales year-on-year would be especially detrimental, rather than continuing cost pressure.
"This long and warm summer could not have come at a worse time for grocery stores and time will tell if the more temperate temperatures we had in August will provide that much-needed breath."
The total increase in sales of bars and restaurants, including those recently opened, was 2.7% in July, indicating a slowdown in the presentation of brands.

One in Five Kids Have Secret Social Media Accounts That Hide Parents
One in five children, some 11 years old, have secret social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers, according to a survey.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has indicated an increase in "fake Insta" pages
News has heightened fears about the publication of sexual content
20% of students say they have a “main” account that they show to parents
One in five children, some 11 years old, create social media accounts that hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has indicated a rapid increase in "fake Insta" accounts, a reference to Instagram, the site for sharing photos.
The news has heightened fears about the publication of sexual content.
20% of students say they have a "main" net account that they show to parents, while they also have a private one.
A mother who discovered the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter saw a message from a teenage girl urging others to “rape me.”
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Committee of Private School Directors (HMC) of independent schools, has revealed that 40% of teens aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, half of whom admit to having private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s disturbing that many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" in the directive of the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Federation's board at the organisation's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most medal-winning field and track athlete, and President Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those leading the sport to benefit from his extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh has the respect of the athletics community in Scotland, the United Kingdom and around the world and we are confident that Scottish athletics will benefit from its incorporation into the directive," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am very keen to act as the voice of the athletes and I hope to be able to grow the sport and contribute to Scotland."
The American, who won gold at the 200th and 400th Olympics in 1996 in Atlanta, among a total of four Olympic golds and is currently a regular BBC commentator, was prevented from walking after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time will tell if I can recover or to what degree.
It has been exhausting, but I have fully recovered, I have learned to walk again and today it is time to do agility exercises!
Thank you for the heartfelt messages!”
A cartoon ad that compares mothers with cows divides opinion on the Internet
A stripper company has shared the opinion on the Internet with an ad comparing nursing mothers to cows who are breastfed.
To mark the launch of what is considered the "world's first silent tie that can be worn", consumer technology company Elvie has released an ad inspired by a music video of a joke to show the freedom that the new tie gives to mothers.
Four royal mothers dance in a barn full of mud and cows to the rhythm of a song that includes lyrics such as: "Yes, I munyo to myself, but you will not see a tail" and "If you hadn't noticed, they are not brats, but my breasts".
The return continues: "Pump, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, munyo the girls".
However, the announcement, published on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mix of reactions from who has seen it, many of which claim to show the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, with the difference being that they are separated from their babies a few days after giving birth.”
Elvie's Tie Hidden in a Lactation Bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented the following: "Understandably traumatic for the mother and baby.
But why not use them to advertise a t-shirt for mothers who will keep their babies?"
Another user added, “It’s an ad out of place.”
Other people defended the ad; one woman admitted that finding the song was "fun".
“I think it’s a great idea.
I would buy one if I still had to breastfeed.
Pumping for the pulley made me feel exactly like a cow.
The announcement is a little crazy, but it should be taken as what it is.
It’s a great product,” one user wrote.
Another person commented the following: "It's a fun ad for mothers pumping with pulleys (usually at their workplace or in the washroom and they feel like cows.
It is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women show that they have all danced with the tie discreetly on the bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women say they feel like they are cows when using the tie.
However, the Elvie tie is completely silent, has no cable or tube and fits discreetly into a lactation bra, giving women more freedom to move, hold babies and even get out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, a partner and early childhood developer at Mother, said: “The Elvie tie is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative campaign.
In drawing the parallel between women and cows, we wanted to show the public how a tie is used and the challenges involved in doing so, while demonstrating, in an entertaining and didactic way, the incredible sense of freedom that the new tie offers.
This isn’t the first time Ellie has been on the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children silently transferred to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has increased even as monthly entries across the border have remained virtually stable, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to sponsor children.
Traditionally, most godparents were undocumented immigrants, who have been afraid to risk their chances of staying in the country if they decided to take in a child.
The risk has increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and the rest of adults living in their homes will have to send fingerprints, which will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had requested unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no prior criminal record.
“About 80% of the people who have hosted or live in the home of a person who has hosted are in the country illegally, and the vast majority of them are criminal foreigners.
Therefore, we will continue to pursue these people," Albence said.
To prosecute children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that require some to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many of them will appear by video conferencing, rather than in person, to defend their case in order to obtain legal status before an immigration judge.
All those who are not considered eligible for aid will be deported immediately.
The more time children spend in custody, the more likely they will be to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can generate violent rampages or escape attempts, according to workers and reports that the system has made known in recent months.
Lawyers say these concerns may intensify in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is suffering are more likely to be overlooked because of their size.
They added that moving children to camp without having time to prepare them emotionally or say goodbye to friends can cause them a trauma that many already suffer.
Syria urges U.S., French and Turkish “occupation forces” to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite an eight-year war in the country.
Muallem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "the matter will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must be withdrawn immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Muallem has insisted that the "war of terror is practically over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and the conflict has caused millions of displaced people.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we have purged all Syrian territory" from both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the territory of a war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Muallem said conditions were good for their return and blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "irrational fears" that make refugees want to stay away.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing an issue that should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats have said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral zone at the last major rebel stronghold, Idlib, has favored an opportunity to continue political meetings.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by Syrian forces with the help of Russia in the province, where three million people live.
However, Muallem has noted that the agreement has "clear terms" and has expressed hope that the military action will confront the jihadists, which include fighters from the al-Nusra Front linked to al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, a UN envoy, hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members soon to begin profiling a post-war constitution and paving the way for elections.
Muallem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, whose task should be limited to "revising the articles of the current constitution," and warned of possible interference.
Why Trump will win for the second time
According to this logic, Trump would win the 2020 election again unless, as many liberal spectators are likely to expect, scandals and the impeachment process end his presidency prematurely.
What would, without a doubt, be “the end of the most dramatic presidency in history.”
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the spectators.
Since 2014, the number of viewers at peak audience hours has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and virtually tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at peak hours, from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has led cable television audiences with up to 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
“People have been squatting because they don’t understand it,” said Neal Baer, executive producer of ABC’s Designated Survivor series, about a cabinet decreer who becomes president when an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 election?
The taxi driver told him he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” he asked.
“He told me that because I made him laugh,” Scovell told me.
There is a point of entertainment in the chaos.
Of course, unlike television programs, the script coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families could come together and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, to be an informed citizen is to go beyond when you find Donald Trump's sixth hour to see a group of experts debate the use that Bob Woodward has made of sources "for private use" for his book "Fear", his coat of arms of ostrich hides him from Paul Manafort's pea ("he stole the $15,000 peacock)
I don’t think I’ll ever see Super Mario again.
“Part of what makes it look like I’m part of a reality show is that every night gives you something new,” says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars” about the character changes and script turns of Trump’s show (fighting the NFL, acclaimed Kim Jong-Un).
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're left behind.
When I saw Fleiss this week, there was a temperature of about 25 degrees and it was sunny outside the house he has on the north coast of Kauai, but he stayed locked watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't get rid of it, not with Brett Kavanaugh about to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging by a thread.
“I remember when we were doing those sloppy programs back then and people were saying it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it would be a joke, but it looks like they were right.”

External money floods races in mid-term elections to the tightest House of Representatives
It is no surprise that there is a cash inundation in the 17th District of Pennsylvania, thanks to the realignment of the congressional districts that has caused two current members to compete for the same square.
This recent reassignment of the Pittsburgh suburban district involves Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won the seat in another district after special elections last spring.
Lamb faces another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th District of Pennsylvania, which comes into conflict with the new 17th District.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former districts were unconstitutionally divided in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district has sparked a financial war between the main financial organizations of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee for Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb made a name for himself in Pennsylvania after an adjusted victory in a long-running special election held in March to represent Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
Republicans have held office for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points of difference.
Political experts give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States imposes sanctions on Salvador for its support of China, but withdraws them
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Trump held a tense meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Valera in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners pulled out of the Trump Organization’s management team.
State Department officials have decided to remove heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over "recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan," department spokesman Heather Nauert said this month.
However, only the possibility of sanctioning El Salvador, which in 2017 received US aid of 140 million dollars, was considered, according to estimates, for the control of drug trafficking, development and economic improvements.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions on visas issued, would be detrimental to the Central American country and the high death toll from murder and atrocities.
With the passage of the internal meetings, officials from both countries postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity to continue with a similar meeting held last year that was seen as a step forward to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials clarified that they wanted the meeting to take place, which effectively ended any likelihood of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has been chosen for the meeting, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the administration's importance, according to diplomats.
The three U.S. envoys discreetly returned to their offices in the Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A spokeswoman for the Bolton White House declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations since anonymity.
An external analyst, close to the administration and also since anonymity, corroborated the statements.
Studying History
The next event to occur could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, of which there is numerous evidence in the public records.
Mueller is also investigating whether Trump’s campaign collaborated with Russia in its attack on the election.
If Congress changes hands, Trump could find himself accountable to the body, just as he prepares to do so in front of voters, and even before a jury of party members.
There are many circumstantial conditions, and I don’t want to suggest that the fall of Trump, or any of his European namesakes, is inevitable.
There are decisions that must be taken on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the situation will last.
In 1938, German officers were willing to strike a coup d'état against Hitler, only if the Western bloc had resisted it and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and we missed the opportunity to avoid all the years of terror that followed.
The course of history fluctuates on points of inflection such as this and the inexorable progress of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The United States is currently facing several inflection points.
What will happen if Trump bids farewell to Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been with the water on his neck since this newspaper reported that, last year, it suggested secretly recording the president and speculated that he was not fit for office.
Rosenstein argues that the Times' information is not accurate.
“How will we respond if the new investigation the FBI has requested about Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it is upheld by the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And, especially, will we vote in mid-term for a Congress that will make Trump responsible for it?
If we do not overcome these tests, democracy will begin to run into danger.
But I don’t think we’ll fail, because I’ve already learned the lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the ambassador’s house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light sabbath candles on that table with swastika.
With this baggage, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorrans, of the Rangers, optimist in the face of the game against the Vienna Rapid
The Rangers receive the Vienna Rapid on Thursday, aware that a victory against the Austrians, after an impressive draw at the Vila-real field this month, would leave them in a good position to qualify for the Europa League Group G.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing the first minutes of the season until the 2-2 draw against Vila-real, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for great results.
"It was a positive point for us, because Vila-real is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
“We played the game in the belief that we could get a valuable result and we came out with a point.
Maybe we could have gotten something more out of it in the end, but overall, the tie was probably a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but we were better than them in the second.
On Thursday, it's another great European night.
We hope to be able to keep all three points, but it will be a difficult game because they got a good result in the last game, but I am sure we will give everything and achieve a good result with the support of the amateur.
“Last year was really tough, with the injuries I suffered and the changes at the club, but now it’s a good place to be.
The team is fine and the boys enjoy it, the trainings are good.
I hope we can give it all, leave it behind last season and be successful.”
Women lose sleep because of fear of retirement savings.
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked about it with their family.
About half of the respondents at the national level say they have spoken with their partner about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of respondents said they had spoken to their children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t dare to consider it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance company Nationwide.
We have to start here.
Talk to your partner and your children: you can’t prepare your family to care for you if you don’t communicate your desires well in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to decide where and how to get care, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Include your financial advisor in the conversation – it can also help you determine how to pay for these expenses.
Your financing options for your long-term care can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a value-effective hybrid life insurance policy that helps you cover your expenses, or a self-insurance with your own resources, if you have to do so.
Prepare your legal documents: cut the passage into legal battles.
Look for a representative to be able to appoint a trusted person to supervise your medical care and make sure that professionals fulfill your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Also consider the possibility of hiring a notary for your finances.
You should select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid in case of disability.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly relative has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Specify these details in a written plan to be prepared.
“Finance is not the only factor that has to be determined, but also which doctors you want to deal with,” Martin said.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have this plan ready.”
Man shot several times with a compressed air gun in Ilfracombe
A man has received several shots from a compressed air gun while returning home after going out at night.
The victim, about 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officials have described the shooting, which took place around 2.30 a.m. (British summer time) as a "random act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His life is not in danger from the injuries and the police have made a call to find witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died due to a strong earthquake and tsunami that shook the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities. The number of deaths is expected to increase.
As communications are cut off, aid units have been unable to obtain information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu closest to the epicentre of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated following the disaster.
Below are some important data about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the Central Celebes province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along more than 300 km of coastline to the northwest of the island of Celebes.
The Regency, an administrative region less than a province, had an approximate population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of Central Celebes Province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast of the other end of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have suffered several tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, a tsunami occurred in western Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific belt of fire and earthquakes usually occur there with a certain frequency.
The following are the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Ace province, north of Sumatra, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Thousands of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that destroyed the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake shook a pop area of the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake rocked one of the islands of Mentawai off the coast of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake affected the Regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic as the population recalled the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, no tsunami occurred, but more than 100 people died due to the buildings that fell.
2018: A series of major earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok that killed more than 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists trapped temporarily.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, a native of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and resistance to arrest, according to a report published Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, she stretched out her phone.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su Interim Detention Centre, where he is being held with an unsecured $500 bond, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday when he pleaded "not guilty, with certainty" when asked how he was pleading, according to the network.
Palin faces three Class A fouls, which means he could go to jail for up to a year and have to pay a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also accused of a Class B foul, which can be punished with a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
Currently, the case is in the hands of the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interference with the report of a crime of domestic violence and possession of a weapon in a state of intoxication in connection with the incident.
His wife told him that she had punched him in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans for associating her son's violent behavior with a post-traumatic stress disorder derived from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck Indonesia's Celebes Island on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not working and the number of deaths is expected to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake occurred just off the coast of Central Celebes, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On social media, videos are circulated with the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Call for Exceptional Death Penalty for Suspect of New York Terrorist Attack
New York federal prosecutors are calling for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terror attack that killed eight people: an extraordinary punishment that has not been applied to the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rental truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike lane on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan and hit pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "intentionally" and that he "intentionally" caused serious personal injuries, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in the southern New York district.
Both crimes could be punishable by death, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury attacked Saipov with a 22-fault indictment that included eight murder charges in favor of organized crime, which federal prosecutors often use in mafia cases, as well as a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
Prosecutors said the attack required "considerable planning and premeditation" and described Saipov's way of acting as "inhumane, cruel and depraved".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York brought a death penalty case to justice.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a federal New York case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to carry out espionage actions for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no regrets in the days and months following the attack.
Police said they told investigators they felt good about what they had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone.
According to police, he also requested that the ISIS flag be deployed in his hospital room.
He has pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the indictment's decision.
"We consider that the decision to seek the death penalty, rather than accepting a plea of guilt and a life sentence without the possibility of freedom, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all the people involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative Party Member of Parliament Says NIGEL FARAGE Should Be In Charge of Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize popular troops" today during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former UKIP leader has said politicians should "feel the pressure of eurosceptics" when one of Theresa May's own MPs has suggested she should lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told the Birmingham march that the UK would already be outside the EU if Mr Farage was the Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Mrs. May faces in reconciling her deeply divided ranks has been highlighted when pro-union conservatives have rallied in another protest against Brexit in La City.
The prime minister is struggling to keep her Chequers commitment plan amid the attacks of Brexit supporters, Union supporters and the EU.
The Allies insist that it will manage to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the negative responses and pressure Eurosceptics and the conservative party to choose between its package and chaos.
Mr. Bone told Solihull's Leave Means Leave meeting that he wanted to undo Chequers' commitment.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been appointed a member of the House of Lords and that he should have been given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in office, we would have been out,” he said.
MEP Wellingborough added: “I will defend Brexit, but we must undo Chequers’ commitment.”
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he added: “We did not fight world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British population has changed their mindset and wants to stay there is totally false."
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march and told reporters: "I'm just telling you, Prime Minister, listen to the people."
Chequers’ commitment is unpopular among the general public, the opposition will not vote in favour of it, it is unpopular within our party and our activists, who are the people who take to the streets and get us to win elections.
Give up Chequers' commitment and start listening."
In a message to Mrs. May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Mr Farage said that the politicians at the rally must feel pressure if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“This, now, is a matter of trust between us (the people) and our political class,” he said.
“They are trying to betray Brexit and today we are here to tell them that we will not allow them to.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make the political class, about to betray Brexit, feel the pressure.”
“We are mobilizing the popular troops of this country who gave us the victory with Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous and proud UK.”
Meanwhile, supporters of the union marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists waved banners over conservatives against Brexit after the group launched this weekend.
The Conservative member of the House of Lords Lord Adonis laughed at the Conservatives for the security problems they suffered with an application of the party at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have the necessary IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus deal, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
“It’s a complete farce.
There is no option for a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren is considering the possibility of running for the presidency.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at an open meeting in the western part of Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP State Representative Geoff Diehl, who served as deputy president of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
It has been the center of speculation about the possibility of ousting Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with constituents with the open-ended format since Trump took office.
An assistant asked him if he intended to run for the presidency.
Warren responded that it is time for “women to go to Washington to repair our government that doesn’t work, and that includes a woman in the dome.”
A man arrested for the death of Sims, LSU
Baton Rouge police announced on Saturday that a suspect has been arrested for shooting dead LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department has announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at the 11:00 ET press conference.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for collaboration to identify the man in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and died near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got a shot in the head that eventually killed him," police officer Murphy J. Paul told 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to having been on the scene, in possession of a gun, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton District Police Department.
Sims, a junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starts during the last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton wins the world title after the orders of the team handed him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas was ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes team orders would play an important role in the race.
From the pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost exhausted Hamilton while defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel boxed earlier and let Hamilton run with the traffic at the back of the pack, which should have been decisive.
Later, Mercedes had to stop at pits and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced after some wheel-to-wheel action that caused the Ferrari driver to leave the free interior at the risk of being left out after a double move to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started in the last row of the grid and at the end of the first lap was in seventh position on his 21st birthday.
He then continued in a good position much of the race as he retained his wheels to save time, advance to Kimi Raikkonen and move on to fourth position.
He eventually entered the pits on lap 44, but was unable to increase the pace in the next eight laps and Raikkonen placed fourth.
It’s a tough day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman who was told to let me go.
The team has done a fantastic job to have a u-two,” Hamilton said.
His body language was terrible.
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally Saturday to insist she didn't leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
At a rally in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate proved that people are "sick, cruel, and liars."
"One thing that could happen and the most beautiful of what is happening in the last days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people angry, bad, cruel and lying," he said.
“When you look at the press releases and the leaks and they say, ‘No, it wasn’t me.
It wasn’t me.”
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you filter it?
Remember your answer... you filtered the document? "Hey, what?
No, no, no, no.
I didn't filter it."
Hey, wait a minute.
We filtered... No, we didn’t filter it,” she added as she imitated the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing Ford's statements against Kavanaugh in July and leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s statements, I didn’t filter out her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
"He asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential, just as he asked me to."
But his denial did not please the President, who commented at the Saturday night rally: "You know what? His body language was terrible.
Maybe he didn’t, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats were using the statements for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by the necessary means.
You see the evil, the cruelty, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to have power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars repaired Friday's loss to the Elite against the Belfast Giants, as they won the return game 5–3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants immediately got a two-goal advantage thanks to the finishes of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie raised their team's level, but then Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised the Dundees. Afterwards, two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured his victory.
It was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's men, who had just won the Dundee 2–1 at Belfast on Friday.
It was the fourth game of the season between the two teams and the Giants had won the previous three games.
The first goal came from Dwyer's hand in the fourth minute, at 3:35, of an assist from Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later, with the assistance of David Rutherford, Beauvillier would double his lead.
During this hectic initial period, Sullivan placed the home team back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt facilitated the equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead in the first pause when he scored the second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and, again, Bouchard contributed to his level with a powerful goal in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time during the game at the end of the second half and secured his team's victory with the fifth goal near the end of the game.
The Giants, who have already lost four of their last five games, are at home in Milton Keynes and have their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies after saving hundreds of passengers from a plane from an earthquake
An Indonesian aerial controller has become a hero after dying to make sure a plane with hundreds of passengers landed safely.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a major earthquake struck the island of Celebes on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Many replicas are being produced in the area and many people are trapped among the ruins in the city of Palu.
But, despite his comrades escaping to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to give up his seat at the trembling control tower of Palu Mutiara Six Al Jufri Airport.
He stayed in place to make sure flight Batik 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take the flight safely.
Then he came out of the air traffic control tower when he thought it was sinking.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia's Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“It broke my heart,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, while the disaster mitigation agency has said access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The death toll is expected to rise because there are still many bodies under the ruins and there are still many that have not been accessed," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves, with a height of up to six meters, have devastated Palu, which will celebrate a common funeral on Sunday.
The armed forces and some commercial aircraft are carrying aid and quakes.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute, an ambulance carries corpses.
Drinking water is scarce.
All the mini-markets have been plundered.”
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is working against the clock to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could only get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the armed forces: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” she told CNN.
Indonesia suffered another earthquake this year in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Aviation Accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini Now Says One Man Has Disappeared After Lacuna Accident
The airline operating a flight that is about to crash into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says a man has disappeared, although it previously said the 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the plane that was sinking.
Air Niugini said in a statement that they had not found a passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline claimed to be working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find him.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as their age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew as the plane crashed into the water as it attempted to land at the Chuuk Islands airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been taken to a hospital.
The airline said that on Saturday there were still six passengers in the hospital and that they were all in good condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unknown.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy claimed that the plane moored in the lagoon because the runway was short.
Some witnesses believe that the plane passed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes explained that the plane was going very low.
“That was extremely positive,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers managed to walk with water through the waist to the emergency exits of the plane, which was sinking.
He said the flight attendants panicked and started screaming, and that he suffered a mild head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to improve a pier also helped in the rescue with an inflatable boat to carry the affected people ashore before the plane sank about 30 meters into the water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicates that 111 people have died in PNG-registered airline accidents, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these accidents.
An analyst composes a chronology of the night that burned alive a woman
The prosecution concluded the case on Saturday in a review of the trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used the cell phone records to build the movements of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night he died.
Rowlett said he received location data from various mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night he died, contradicting his previous statements, according to reports from The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak with Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford denied it and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he had lied, as his truck was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
The phone records indicated that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that, some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of her life," Hale said.
The defense plans to begin its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury throughout the same day.
The High Breed: What is Hip-Hop Consciousness?
A hip-hop trio fills their music with positive messages to challenge the negative view of the genre.
The Bristol High Breed claims that hip-hop has moved away from its origins with political messages and social issues.
They want to get back to their roots and re-fashion the conscious hip-hop.
Some artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have experienced a recent resurgence in the UK at the hands of artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York City Nurse Demands Parent for Leaving After ‘Racist’ Message
A nurse in New York has denounced a couple for a discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected text message from the mother protesting because she was "another black person."
The couple denies that they are racist and compares the lawsuit with an “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, expressed dismay at seeing the new nurse, Giselle Maurice, black when she came to work on the first day in 2016.
“NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
But instead of sending it to her husband, he sent it to Mrs. Maurice, twice.
After realizing her puffiness, an "uncomfortable" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, alleging that the nurse she had fired, who was African-American, had done her job wrong and that she was expecting a Filipino person, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice received the payment corresponding to her working day and was then sent home with an Uber.
Now, Maurice claims the couple compensation for the dismissal and asks for compensation of approximately $350 per day for the six-month-old job for which they had contracted her, although there was no contract.
"I want to show them that things like this can't be done," he told the Post on Friday, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have responded to claims that they are racist, claiming that Maurice's dismissal was the most reasonable, as they were afraid they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
"My wife sent him something I didn't want to say.
He's not racist.
We are not racist people," her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
A baby?
Come on."
Plasco, who has compared the lawsuit to a "extortion," said his wife had two months to have a baby and was in a "very difficult situation."
“Are you going to pursue something like that?
It’s not a very kind attitude,” added the investor banker.
The legal case has not yet been resolved and the court of public opinion has rushed to denounce the couple on social networks and condemn their behavior and logic.
Paddington editors feared readers would not identify with a talking bone, according to a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said in relation to the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in someone's shoes that binds it for the first time before its publication.
It’s very funny, now that we know what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
He explained that his father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he had the inspiration to write the children's book about a small teddy bear, was optimistic about rejecting the book. He also said that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "aggressive", after his death last year.
He describes Paddington as a very important member of his family and adds that his father was very proud of the success he had finally achieved.
"He was a discreet man; he was not a presumptuous man," she said.
“But since Paddington was so real to him, it was practically like when your son gets something: you take pride, even if it’s not your thing.
I think that's how he considered Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always used to recognize Paddington's own merit."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone
When they landed, they rushed their daughter to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called frequently to say that he was very serious and that they did not expect him to get over it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got a call from Nad and he told me that he would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, beautiful.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll go with you.
The medications she had been given to keep her body baptizing were being consumed and were coming out of her system.
He had died before it was planned and so everything was wiped out.
I just had to sit back and wait, because I knew what was going on.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by family and more people.
I had to stay in good shape.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the rest of the passengers, distraught from the experience that was going on.
“Nobody knew,” he said.
“I had my head in my elbow and my tears didn’t stop falling.
It’s hard to explain, but during the flight I felt a sense of sympathy for Nad overwhelming.
The feeling I needed my love and my understanding.
I know I loved her very much.”
Women in mourning hang cards to prevent suicides on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are working to prevent other people from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been hanging cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that citizens can call for assistance.
Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began suffering from depression and, at the age of 18, killed himself.
“I don’t want any father or mother to feel what I have to feel every day,” he said.
Mrs Davis, 45, who resides in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that their smile could illuminate any room.”
However, he quit his job before he died because he was in a "very dark spot."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after he took his own life.
Ms. Davis said: "I am continually concerned that there is a collateral effect."
Ms. Davis created the cards “because people know that there are people you can go to, that you can listen to, even if it’s a friend.
“Don’t be silent, you have to speak.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after Mark's mother's death.
“He never said he wasn’t feeling well or depressed or anything like that,” she said.
“A couple of days before Christmas we noticed a change of attitude.
He touched bottom on Christmas day, when the children opened their presents and he didn’t look them in the eye or anything.”
He said that his death meant a great trauma for them, but that they had to work it: "Open a hole in the family.
It's ruining us.
But we have to keep fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs by a thread as FBI investigates
"I thought that if we could get something like what he was asking for (an investigation with a scope and a limited time), we could get some unity," Mr. Flake said Saturday. He also added that he feared the committee would be destroyed with the stalemate of the supporters.
Why didn’t Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
His reluctance has to do with the moment.
Only five weeks are left for the November 6 midterm elections. If, as expected, Republicans do not get good results, they will see weaknesses in getting the man they want elected to arrive at the country's top court.
George W. Bush has been picking up the phone to call the senators and pressuring them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who has worked in the White House for Mr. Bush. He also met his wife Ashley through Mr. Bush as she was his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI creates its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice President, to undo the tie and confirm him in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean deserters "cau" with Kim
The number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Southern Unification, said there had been 1,127 desertions last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said strict border controls between North Korea and China and rising prices charged by human traffickers had been the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Typically, the vast majority of North Korean deserters are offered the citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul sources say more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to create than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters illegal migrants, rather than refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on stalled denuclearization negotiations.
This came after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work toward a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in these circumstances, we will not disarm ourselves unilaterally first," Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is a "historical" and not fit to work in the High Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said that Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh is a "historical" and that his temperament makes him incapable of working in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival held in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman had acted this way, she would have been told that it's a 'historical'," Pelosi said in relation to her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh, excited, denied allegations of sexually abusing Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes screaming and speechless as he talked about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the committee’s Democrats and said the accusations against him amounted to a “grotesque and coordinated murder of a character” organized by the angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not work in the High Court, as it showed his prejudices against the Democrats.
"I think he's disqualified himself with these statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi showed reluctance when asked if he would attempt to contest Kavanaugh's election, if it is confirmed, and if Democrats achieve a majority in the House of Representatives.
“This is what I can say: if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he’s not only not qualified to be in the High Court, he’s not qualified to be in the court where he is now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh currently serves as a judge in the District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about the decisions Kavanaugh could make against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as she is considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearings, he shunned questions about whether he would overturn certain decisions of the High Court.
“This is not the time for a hysterical and prejudiced person to enter the Court and expect it to look wonderful,” Pelosi said.
Women need to exercise their power.
It is a justifiable diatribe: months and years of abundant fury and cannot get it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's very common. And you?"
She continued... “I was helped a lot by a woman who was an executive somewhere who told me that she was crying when she was angry, but that she developed a tactic that consisted of, when she was angry and started crying, saying to the person she was talking to, ‘Maybe you think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then it continued.
I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger in part because, basically, they are misinterpreted.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs in an office with a male majority, where I once ended up crying with an indescribable rage, is that of an older woman (a cold directive that had always scared me a little bit) who grabbed me from the claw and dragged me to the eye.
“Never let them see you cry,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be happy because they’ll have you.”
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democrat from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was discovered on an extramarital adventure on a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, thought there was no reason not to explore the idea of presenting herself as a presidential candidate.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” he told me as he laughed 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone said, "White Man and the Seven Dwarfs."
As he arrived late for the campaign, he was delayed in fundraising, so he promised not to enter the race if he did not raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to the men, were only willing to give 250 to her.
“Do you think I have a discount?” he asked.
When she delivered her speech and announced that she would not start a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions (thank you for the people who had helped her, frustration with the system for the difficulty of raising money and orienting herself to the voters, instead of doing it to the delegates, and anger, and sexism) that she stopped feeling.
“It might have been thought that I had a nervous breakdown,” said Schroeder, referring to the reaction of the press.
“It could have been thought that my corporate sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking: What will they put in my grave?
"Are you going to cry?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The initial salvos of the U.S.-China trade war were deafening and, although the war does not seem to have to end soon, a distant country may prove beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year when he imposed taxes on China’s major exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week, with new tariffs affecting products worth USD 200 billion. These tariffs involve a tax on half of all goods arriving in the U.S. from China.
Beijing has counterattacked in the same way each time and recently raised tariffs from five to ten percent for $60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has pledged to replicate the U.S. and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to roll back anytime soon.
To have Washington back down involves giving in to some demands, but to bow publicly to the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the trade war with the US could benefit China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that trigger a fall in any of these countries is far more dangerous than the witnesses had anticipated,” said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher at the Center for New American Security, an expert committee.
Syria 'prepared' for return of refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country, devastated by a war of more than seven years.
In front of the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Currently, the situation on the streets is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress that has been made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas that terrorists have destroyed to restore normalcy.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country who had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and maintenance are met.
The EU estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
There are also six million people living in the country who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime appreciates any help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he said he would not accept conditional aid or aid from the countries that financed the insurgency.
The European team wins the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team has achieved the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The U.S. has already lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team won the crown again when the team of the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's reached the 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who fought for most of the tournament, shot the starter in the water at par 3 16, giving victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined in all his series and became one of four players who have achieved 5-0-0 since he began the current format of the tournament in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was set off with a 5&4 by the least qualified player of the European team Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark.
The world's most qualified player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2–1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The eight-time Ryder Cup veteran, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the biggest winner the tournament has ever had, with 25.5 race points.
“I don’t want to cry, but I can’t help it today.
It's been a very hard year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I got the cup back.
The team is the most important ... And I am happy to have been able to help," said an excited Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the relief to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in an individual competition on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, I grew up following him,” said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost all four games he had in France and now has a career record in the Ryder Cup of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the best players ever, with 14 great titles won and only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team's frustrating performance: "I'm proud of these players, they fought.
This morning there was a moment when we pressed the European selection.
We fought.
I'll take my hat off for Thomas.
He is a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will regroup, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and move forward.
“I love these 12 players and I’m proud to have been their captain.
He's got to get his hat off.
They have defeated us.”
