During an emergency call, the professor admitted that he had shot his girlfriend.
During a phone call to the emergency line with a shaking voice, Professor Shannon Lamb confessed to police that he had shot his girlfriend and it was necessary for them to come home.
Lamb pretended that his "sweet dog" was alive and probably upset at home, and that contacts to the dead woman's family can be found on her phone.
Inside police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten message on the white office paper: "I'm so sorry and wish I could give it back, I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me," Lamb wrote in the letter.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would drive 300 miles to a school campus where police believe he shot favorite professor Ethan Schmidt at the door of his office.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said the university staff heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
Lamb reportedly made a fatal phone call to the emergency line shortly after.
Finally, another death came; Lamb took his own life when the police came for him.
The day after the shooting at the school forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors, the authorities were still trying to find out what Lamb's motivation was.
The details, published by state investigators and students and employees who knew him, together created an image of a talented but likely troubled teacher.
The students confirmed that they were looking forward to his lesson.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that she had no criminal record or a violent past.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in the book he wrote, in his thanks to the “great people” with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History along with 17 other faculty members and many students attended courses at both at the same time.
At the same time, there were inclinations in terms of problems.
A student who praised Lamba, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed agitated and shaken, "as if something were wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously applied to Delta State University for leave for health reasons when he said he had a problem.
And this year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the recruitment of university staff meant that the doctorate on which Lamb worked hard would not guarantee him an automatic tenure to become a professor's assistant.
University President William LaForge said he did not know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr. Lamb apparently was bothering something."
Lamb will no longer answer these questions.
After leaving campus, police caught his trail as he crossed the Arkansas state border back to Mississippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb shot himself with a gun in the backyard of a house about a mile from his parents in the suburbs of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington state coroner Methel Johnson confirmed.
He left the car on the street.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb was going to this house, although Johnson said he probably knew the people who lived here.
The lamb grew up in this country.
Lamb began working at a university that has 3,500 students in the city, which has a population of about 12,000, in 2009 and taught geography and education classes.
He received his doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lamb’s longtime friends described him as a smart, charismatic and funny man.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lambo 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She was with her friends in high school and he was the great older boy who taught her to play guitar for several years.
He was quite a heartbreaker at the time.
The hearts of all the girls rose as soon as he showed up,” says Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in the Jackson suburbs.
Lamb and Prentiss are said to have been dating for a while.
During an emergency call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but the wedding record never existed.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in a brick house adjacent to the Gautier River shoulder.
The police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss’s ex-husband, Shawn O’Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter, who is now 19 years old.
"She was completely devastated," O'Steen said of his daughter.
She was my best friend with my mother.
O'Steen said he had not met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he knew that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when she and Abigail performed at a summer festival three years ago.
Later, they played random gigs together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and occasional entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a light bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5, sweating Lamb’s guitar and harmonica for an innumerable crowd.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"It was just a happy couple," he said.
We chatted and made jokes with each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, a murdered professor, led the seminar in the first year and specialized in original American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of a boys' student club and student government.
At the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including faculty members, staff, students, and community members, attended a candlelight commemorative event.
Schmidt's wife Liz, and brother Jeff Schnidt, also attended the vigil, during which the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
The school started again on Wednesday.
“We’re trying to get our students back,” LaForge says.
The crisis is behind us.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis filed a report in Cleveland, Mississippi.
Writers for the Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans, also contributed to this reportage.
This story has been edited to reflect the fact that police now claim that Lamb made a phone call to the emergency line after he killed Schmidt, and that although Lamb called Prentiss his wife, there is no evidence that they were actually robbed.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us says they won’t be recruiting as many seasonal workers as last year, but the manufacturer of children’s toys and products says it will give current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company also said it plans to hire about 40,000 employees to work in stores and distribution centers across the country, down from 45,000 last season.
Most of the jobs will be part-time.
The company says it will start recruiting candidates this month, and will recruit staff during October through December.
While the holidays themselves are months away, the shopping holiday season is approaching, and companies are preparing to temporarily hire employees to assist in stores and sales, for shipping and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox Jokes About His 'Rande' With Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the arrival of the royal family when I realized that the seat next to me was empty and I figured that Princess Diana would be sitting there," he said in the trailer for the upcoming documentary, "Back in Time."
The film begins and I realize that I am within reach of something that could be called a fake date with a Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time," is a documentary about "Back to the Future," which features interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson, and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back to the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
Spielberg said: “It’s certainly the best travel document ever filmed for me.”
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia’s accelerated military support for Syria is that “there is no military solution” to the nearly five-year conflict and more weapons will only worsen the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief again urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unify and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a press conference on Wednesday that he planned to meet with foreign ministers of five permanent councils of countries - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly's ministerial meeting at the end of this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He expressed regret that the divisions in the Council and between the Syrian people and the regional powers "made this situation unresolvable."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity they have shown in reaching an Iranian nuclear deal in resolving the crisis in Syria.
8 Election Numbers That Show Donald Trump in the Real Light
Some have tried to label him as a person who often changes his mind.
The others waved their hands like a failed joke.
And some are preparing for an implosion.
But even though some Republicans are trying to pull Donald Trump down from the top of the election, they are not (yet) succeeding.
10 of the last 11 national surveys show that Donald Trump is in the lead by a double-digit number, and some people are starting to seriously ask what that means for this real estate magnate’s nomination chances.
Of course, the election cycle is just beginning.
None of this says Trump is likely to win a Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, the leadership of Rick Perry made the path to the rise of Herman Cain, in the end, not one of them won a single position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why it might come across in general elections.
But outside groups like Super PAC Jeba Bush and the economic conservative Club for Growth are realizing Trump’s will to endure and are starting to put their dollars on the stand in order to overthrow him.
Here are some recent voting numbers that suggest that a real estate magnate is not just a passing phase:
Trump’s approval rating turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a vote by Monmouth University showed that only two out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of this real estate tycoon.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Six out of 10 Republicans now have a favorable view of Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion of him.
And these numbers are held in the early stages.
After the Quinnipiac University vote last week, it was found that 60 percent of Republicans had a positive opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either “enhanced” or “satisfied” with Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of 10 said they would be "angered" by his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent of people said they would be “excited” versus 40 percent who say the same thing about Trump).
The next closest in level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21%.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be “dissatisfied” or “disturbed” if the company’s favorite Jeb Bush became a candidate.
Most Republicans don’t see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his bloating and insults, 52 percent of Republican voters nationwide are inclined to think that the real estate magnate has the right temperament for the president’s post, according to Monday’s ABC News/Washington Post poll.
The same number is held in the state of Iowa’s senatorial club, which is the first in the entire country where 52 percent of Republicans think it has the personality of a commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Yet 44 percent think he doesn’t have a personality to serve effectively, and nearly 6 out of 10 independents say his temperament doesn’t belong in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republicans are accustomed to this idea.
When they put on their scholarly hats, Republican voters think Trump is a real candidate.
Asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four in 10 said Trump would be the best choice, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
This is a change from late July, when four out of 10 bet their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: GOP voters have not had the clearest crystal ball in the past.
Last year, four out of 10 Republicans voted Rick Perry as the nominee against 28 percent for Mitt Romney.
Yet it turns out that a number of GOP voters see Trump’s campaign as credible.
Even though Republicans have gathered around another candidate, Trump is still beating almost everyone.
Some scholars point out that the fragmented field likely contributes to Trump’s leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffused among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that in a hypothetical direct contest between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always wins majority support.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marc Rubie by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christie by 33 points each.
He's in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would lead the trader by a wide 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one match.
A majority of Donald Trump’s supporters say they have already made up their mind.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only more than half of voters who support Trump say they will not change their minds.
It’s obvious that a lot of things can change, and no one can really say that they would never change their mind.
46% say they keep the back door open for change between candidates.
Yet Trump’s current strongest opponent is his outsider counterpart neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who consider their opinion final would go twice as likely to vote for Trump.
6 out of 10 Republicans agree with Trump on the immigration issue.
Even since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico “violent” in his campaign’s whistleblower speech, immigration still holds as the main and central topic of conversation for 2016.
Some fear that Trump’s bloatedness will distract key Hispanic voters from the Republican party and damage will seek to rebrand.
But according to a new ABC/Post poll on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
It seems that as long as the topic of immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will remain as well.
The frustration of the government is reaching new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson today receive about half of the support from Republican voters, especially given their status as outsiders.
Six out of 10 Republicans in a new ABC/Post poll on Monday say they prefer a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they're also very angry at Washington.
The Des Moines Register/Bloomberg vote in Iowa a few weeks ago revealed that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by Republicans in Congress, 54 percent are "discontented" and 21 percent "hell-enraged."
The House supported a larger share of the state's coal fees.
The Czech Republic will receive more than 400 million.
In the first reading, the Chamber of Deputies supported the government's amendment to the upper law, which regulates the amount of charges from the surface mining of brown coal from mining companies.
Minister Jan Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) promised the deputies that thanks to this, they will receive additional money from both the state treasury and the budgets of the municipalities.
The proposal was criticized by opposition MPs, who fear that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as before, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.The House in the first reading supported the government's amendment of the upper law, which, among other things, means that the state should receive more of the profits from the companies.
The share of the state will increase to 67 percent, while the share of municipalities will decrease from the current 75 percent to 33 percent.
The proposal also changes the method of calculating the remuneration for the minerals that companies extract.
The change in mining fees is expected to bring CZK 427 million more to the treasury than in 2013.
According to the government, the revenues of the budgets of the municipalities should have a neutral impact, because the fee is to be higher.
In the previous year, the municipalities received about 450 million CZK from the fees and the state budget 150 million CZK.
About CZK 200 million went to the municipalities and CZK 66 million to the state.
The amendment also envisages an increase in the remuneration of mining areas with permitted mining to 1000 CZK per hectare per year.
Income from these payments shall continue to belong to the municipalities to the full extent.
Industry Minister Jan Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) told MPs that the municipalities would receive 14 million to 100 million crowns per year instead.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but will be determined by the government by its regulations.
The payment will be recalculated as a result of the quantity of minerals extracted and the rates for each type of minerals.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
ODS MP Marek Benda warned, however, that setting a fee by government regulation may not be in line with the constitution.
According to Minister Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dko, however, this is not a tax in this case, because the state charges minerals that are state property.
Fees are paid only to municipalities whose territories are affected by mining.
In the case of deep coal mining, three quarters of the municipality’s money and a quarter of the state will be given.
The same ratio will be in the case of the mining of radioactive rocks.
The part of the money that the state collects on mining fees will be tied to the purpose.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair the damage after mining or to provide mining rescue services.
The proposal was criticized by opposition MPs, who claimed in particular that it would harm the communities affected by mining and the region.
For example, Michal Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as before, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to improve the budget," David K<0xC3><0xA1>dner, elected in the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> region, said.
KS<0xC4><0x8C>M MP Hana Aulick<0xC3><0xA1> warned of the increase in unemployment in Mostek.
Kadner and Aulicka unsuccessfully proposed to reject the amendment, and Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era wanted to return the law to the government for revision.
The reasoning states that, according to mining companies, the increase in fees will not be reflected in the price of coal, as prices are negotiated from more than 90 percent over the long term.
Therefore, the main consumers such as power plants or thermal power plants should not feel the price increase.
"On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organizations will compensate for increases in remuneration by trying to reduce their operating expenses, which would primarily mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government admits.
However, it considers the increase in fees in terms of employment to be bearable.
According to the rapporteur for the amendment, Milan Urban (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), it is crucial that MPs know the conclusions on the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decisions on the limits of coal production before the adoption of the law.
If coal is to be mined beyond limits, then it will have an impact on revenues for the state and municipalities, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dko that the decision to break the limit at the bottom of the Czechoslovak army should fall only after 2020.
According to him, the limits at the bottom of <0xC4><0x8C>SA should be broken for social, national and economic reasons, as well as for the long-term stability of domestic energy.
Cheerful will lead the Czechs as a number one, the deployment will affect the weather.
All four Czech tennis players will appear at Thursday's draw of the Davis Cup in India and this time each of them will most likely hit the game.
Captain Jaroslav Navr<0xC3><0xA1>til plans to spread the load over the entire quartet due to difficult conditions.
Delhi has a hot and high humidity, which is why it is expected to be a challenging match that can last up to five hundred.
We need to take this into account.
I'd like to spread it out according to the weather.
And according to what it will look like, he said Navr<0xC3><0xA1>til at today’s Czech selection training in the center of R<0xC3><0xA1>j<0xC5><0xBE>e Kum<0xC3><0xA1>r Khanna.
With the team number one and the world forty Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Vesel<0xC3><0xBD> counts in the Friday and Sunday duels.
Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Rosol and Radek <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nek will probably pass in the position of two.
I want almost everyone to get involved.
I have a little bit of it in my head, but I'm not going to say it yet, the captain said.
Another certainty in the Czech squad should be <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nkov’s participation in Saturday’s doubles.
It’s just a question of who will stand next to the experienced deblist who has a score of 18:4 in the Davis Cup.
He probably won't be happy.
There are still possibilities with Rosol or Adam Pavl<0xC3><0xA1>sk.
"I really don't know who and what it's going to look like," he said.
It will be decided according to the development of the duo.
A variant may be Pavl<0xC3><0xA1>sek, with Jolly Surprised in the 1st round of the win in the standings over the Australians.
"He's decent in the trunk," he said.
I did it against Australia, and when I play, I would like to show the same performance I showed there from the second set.
"I'm happy for the experience and I'd like to bring a point," Pavl<0xC3><0xA1>sek said.
Yuki Bhambri (125th in the ATP ranking) won the challenger in Shanghai last week, defeating the third and fourth hundredth players.
Two will be Somdev Devvarman (164).
Both are challenger players and ours have ATP Tour experience, but many times we have been convinced that the Davis Cup rankings do not decide.
"It decides the present form, the weather," said Navr<0xC3><0xA1>til.
Friday's inaugural games start at 6:30 AM and may stretch due to the weather.
According to the forecast, it is raining and the court is not under the roof.
However, it can be played under artificial lighting.
They've already set it on fire, and it's got about two thousand lux, which is enough.
"It should be playable under the lights," he said.
Jeremy Corbyn to debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn’s PMQ debut has been highly anticipated
Jeremy Corbyn will make his Prime Minister's Questions debut later, and will be collaborating with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will ask the first of his six assigned questions shortly after noon, while his performance is likely to be carefully scrutinized by the media and lawmakers.
In a weekly statement, he called for "less theater and more facts."
He also said he could skip a few sessions that he would leave to his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corby’s leadership, which comes after his appointment to the shadow cabinet and his Tuesday speech to the TUC’s annual congress.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to remain silent while singing the national anthem in service on Tuesday on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has met with criticism from a number of conservative lawmakers and is the focus of several stories on the front pages of the newspaper.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem attracted attention
Mr Corbyn's spokesman said he would "stand in reverential silence" and recognize "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the battle for Britain."
However, Mr Corbyn’s shadow cabinet member Owen Smith told BBC Two’s Newsnight that he would recommend the Labour leader sing the national anthem “no matter” on his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr. Corbyn’s top team, citing differences in economics, defense and foreign affairs, and only less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences in the work also "swim" after appointing Mr Corbyn over his position in the European Union and the government's allowance limit.
Mr Corbyl said at the TUC conference that the Workers' Party had tabled amended proposals to remove the whole idea of a limit on benefits.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, secretary of shadow work and pensions, said the party was “very clear” against government plans to reduce the limit from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour Party leader to face David Cameron in the last decade since his election as Conservative leader.
The leader of the Labour Party, who promised a different approach to politics, claims he has ideas "from the crowd" for questions for Mr Cameron and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
MP Islington North argues that PMQ is too confrontational and that it will refrain from both "quick responses" and dense trade, and instead promises to focus on important issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges young people face.
Mr. Corbyn claims that Angela Eagle, the shadow trade secretary, will represent him at PMQ when he does not attend — such as when Mr. Cameron travels abroad.
He also gave up the idea that he would let the other colleagues speak for him from time to time, because he was told that he had discussed the whole matter with the Speaker of the House, John Bercow.
When Mr. Cameron became the leader in 2005, he said he wanted to deviate from the "Punch and Judy" style of politics, which was often associated with PMQ, but a few years later he admitted to failing.
Since their first broadcast in 1990, the PMQ has been seen as a key barometer of leaders’ judgment, their leadership in the House, and their stance among other MPs, despite critics arguing that they have become a caricature and that far-reaching reforms are needed.
"Focen<0xC3><0xAD> v Joburg": Young homeless people trained as photographers
The centre of Johannesburg is a difficult place for homelessness.
But a group of former street children found a way to learn something and earn a living.
"I was photographed in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches young homeless people how to take pictures of their neighborhood and make money.
BBC News have met one of the first graduates of this project.

The pound rises, while wage growth in the UK accelerates
The Libra jumped the following dates and showed a recovery in British wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was led above using the SABMiller bid target.
Between May and June, GB earnings including bonuses rose 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
This was the fastest since 2009, and it looked like estimates were approaching when rates would rise.
Sterling rose more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and was up 0.84% against the euro to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49% to 6,229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional market share and jumped 20% after getting a close-up offer from its rival AB InBev.
The deal would combine the two largest breweries in the world, and a close-up of brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging reports from rival luxury goods group Richemont.
The latest Richemont sales results are above all expectations and show that sales in China, a key market for Burberry, have begun to rise again.
Shares in Glencore rose 5% after the mining giant said they rose $2.5bn using a shared placement as part of a debt-reduction strategy.
Shares in the packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest drop in the index and fell by 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs lowered its rating on the company to "sales."
JD Sports grew 3.1% after the sports company reported an 83% jump in earnings before tax of <0xC2><0xA3>46.6m in the middle of the year
JD Sports CEO Says Higher Wages Could Hurt Expansion
JD Sports CEO Peter Cowgill says a higher minimum wage for workers in the UK could mean “greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers.”
But it is unlikely that purchasing power would outweigh the higher wage costs in his company, he says.
The costs could affect plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Opponents of the Prague apartment Mar<0xC5><0xA1>meloun rejoice.
The controversial building got a stop.
The investor Prague Progetti e Investimenti considers the annulment of the decision to be unlawful and will appeal against it.
Hundreds of people protested against the building, which is to be built in the immediate vicinity of the Ane<0xC5><0xBE> Monastery in the center of Prague, before the Prague office.
In the decision, the Magistrate stated that there was a violation of the construction law because not all the requirements of the territorial decision were respected.
"The territorial decision in question does not contain any relevant elements, for example, the type of land, the distance from neighboring buildings, the sufficiently clearly and clearly described shape of the building, the definition of the territory affected by the influence of the building," the decision reads.
The Magistrate also considers it illegal that some of the documents for the decision were issued to the original documents under discussion, but they have changed.
This is, for example, the opinion of the environmental authorities.
Part of the building is to be built on the grounds of the National Gallery, but the investor does not have its valid consent.
However, it is clear from the file that the landowner has only consented to the project documentation for territorial management, not consent to the placement of the building on his land, writes the Department of the Building Code.
According to Francesco Augusto Razett of the investment firm, the Department of Construction did not take note of the decision of the superior body - the Ministry of Local Development, according to which the deadline for the start of the review has already expired.
In any case, this is a scandalous process.
"We have been preparing this project for seventeen years, complying with all the laws of the Czech Republic and respecting all the authorities and institutions concerned," Razetto said in a press release.
The project, which people call marshmallows because of the supposedly designed color of the facade, evokes strong emotions in Prague.
Hundreds of people have gathered in the city centre in the past to protest against the construction.
It bothers the associations and residents of nearby homes that some permits were issued many years ago for a house that was supposed to look different.
They also criticize the inadequacy of the building for the historical center of Prague and the immediate vicinity of the Ane<0xC5><0xBE> Monastery.
The house was designed by the architect Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Fr<0xC3><0xA1>nek, the project changed several times.
The original form of the 2008 project, which had a glass fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade, was rejected by the Ministry of Culture on the basis of the opinion of the National Institute of Monuments (NP<0xC3><0x9A>) and in 2010 the permission of Prague monuments was revoked.
The new project of the company Prague Progetti e Investimenti with windows in the shape of faces but NPU and magistrates approved and on this basis a building permit was issued.
The author of the proposal rejects the objections of the opponents, according to which he never counted on the facade in pink, which gave the project the nickname of pink and white confectionery.
The Czech politician led the migrants.
The Hungarians put him in the bass with them.
Berg went to Hungary in order to bring humanitarian aid to the refugees.
Along the way, he and the crew took three Syrian refugees into the car, who reportedly wanted to drive about half a kilometre.
At that time, he said, it was not criminal in Hungary.
We knew that the law enforcement officers did not affect such actions.
But when the police stopped us, to our surprise, they arrested us and transferred us to the investigative detention in Szeged, he described the letter.
In the end, he spent nine hours in politics.
The police officers said they were behaving correctly, but they were not able to communicate because they could not speak English very well.
He said the prison was sad.
For example, in our cell, which is about three times four meters in size, 15 refugees from Syria were forced to flee.
Among them was a two-year-old boy or a four-year-old girl.
These people were already locked up the next day and because of the language barrier, none of them had any idea what would happen to them, Berg said.
What can't be entertained anymore?
Ask the President of the Executing Chamber.
On Friday 18.9. from 9:30, the President of the Executive Chamber of the Czech Republic, Mgr. Pavla Fu<0xC4><0x8D><0xC3><0xAD>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, will answer the questions of the readers.
You can ask her about changes to the law on executions in force from September 1, 2015 and other things related to executions, or executors.
Metcash launches rural campaign to fight Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from Aldi's attack in southern and western Australia.
Metcash launches rural campaign to fight Aldi invasion
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers and the first of more than 120 stores in southern and western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing and events like Adelaide.
IGA merchants and suppliers join brands such as Dunsborough-based Simmo’s ice cream maker offering tastings in IGA stores, and shop owners sell discounted Australian Football League tickets to local customers.
Metcash is expected to release further details of its defense strategy on September 29, when food, alcohol and hardware vendors celebrate their annual strategic investor day.
There is a lot at stake as South and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Metcash IGA trading steps and generate higher turnover than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Customers in southern and western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA stores enjoy a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland – more than 30 percent in the SA and 24 percent in the WA compared to around 14 percent in the eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe Aldi will account for 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first trades that have taken over revenues from all existing players, but mostly independent retailers.
This week in his report, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retail could lose $360 million in annual sales and Metcash $250 million at the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South Australia and 30 in the West over the next year, and will generate sales of $500 and $600 million in individual markets.
The loss of food sales and volumes in Metcash’s fixed price base could cost it around $13 million in pre-tax revenues, Mr Kierath confirmed.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly against Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that shoppers in the IGA were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley expects Metcash’s food sales to decline by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its market share to decline from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of the financial group Magellan, said business lunches in Melbourne could “highly likely disappear within a decade.
Metcash declined to respond publicly to Douglass's comment.
But it's known that a Metcash board member contacted Douglass last week.
The IGA’s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and the proceeds from the Metcash grocery store, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, have fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the operational developments of the change in speculation as sales and revenues are under pressure.
However, wholesalers have gone on a counter-attack and are investing more than $150 million a year to match counter prices in Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products every week, helping IGA retailers re-equip stores by adding fast-growing food and news from private individuals.
Ian Morrice, Metcash’s chief executive, says the price-matching and re-equipment programs are catching up and hopes the wholesaler will return to basic profitable profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis backed by Tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves fame for his behavior rather than criticism.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has become a side loss in the recent outcry over his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior, Tennis Australia President Steve Healy said.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of the talented duo often referred to as "Special Ks," attracted unwelcome attention due to an affair with the infamous Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in a passionate qualifying match in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his rival Ryan Harrison had to be separated by referees twice, Harrison then declared, "Wawrinka should have stretched one to Kyrgios and I should have stretched him too."
While he was last seen crashing a rocket after a spasm swept through Richard Gasquet's possible ability at the U.S. Open, Kokkinakis relentlessly defended Healy.
The youngster is currently in Glasgow, where he competes with Sam Groth for a second-half position behind Bernard Romic in the Davis Cup semi-finals against Britain.
"I thought quite intensely that in my opinion, Thanasi was a bit involved in the whole dispute," Healy said.
He destroyed a rocket when he lost to a U.S. spasm, but he's not the first player to take his anger off his rocket out of frustration. I know Thanasi well enough and I can say he won't be proud of this event.
But he really controlled himself very well because he was exposed in the US to very provocative circumstances because of Harrison and so on, so in my opinion he deserves a lot of recognition.
He’s got a fantastic team around him, he’s got a great family around him, and I think he’s been treated a bit harshly.
He is a very adult 19-year-old man, he works very hard and fits into the team great and so on, he has never had a problem with other players, he is very respected in the dressing room, he trains hard, he is in great condition, he is a very stable and mature young boy and I just think he deserves to be judged according to his own.
Healy also backed the decision to overlook Kyrgios over an important match that begins on Friday, saying the "mutual decision" is the right solution for everyone, but supporting the Canberry native to return to the team as a long-term stable.
"First of all, we want our team to be completely focused on the game and not on all the controversy that arose around him [Kyrgios]," says Healy.
And I think Nick has risen very fast, as Federer, Murray and other people point out, growing rapidly in the eyes of the public, he has also made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we are trying to support him, we are also trying to help him understand the consequences of my actions, and for some time I will be able to help him understand the consequences of my actions.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares a state of emergency, closes borders and detains migrants
After the threat was announced, Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained those who attempted to cross it illegally in order to stop the influx of migrants.
There was chaos at the border, as hundreds of migrants gathered in the country, and the Serbian authorities reacted outrageously.
Those who have been trapped for an unknown time in the belts of the land between the two states stand those who flee violence in their home countries, build tents and settle in.
But there are feelings of frustration.
When a helicopter flies over them, the migrants together shout "Open the borders!" and hand over the police force to the Hungarian police.
In protest, some refuse food and water.
Serbia's foreign minister says it was "unacceptable" for refugees to be sent back from Hungary, while more and more are arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not just an indirect harm.
In the coming days, it will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries," says Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The unrest on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-state bloc failed to come up with a unified immigration policy at continuing meetings in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to share responsibility for the 40,000 people seeking protection in surprised Italy and Greece, and spoke with hopes of reaching a possible deal next month or at the end of the year that the EU nations would take in more than 120,000 other refugees, including Hungary.
German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called a special EU European summit next week to discuss the continental refugee crisis.
However, Hungary did not place its hopes on Brussels or its neighbours.
Tuesday’s threat situation in two southern regions gave the authorities more power to deal with the crisis and allowed them to close roads and speed up the trial of asylum cases.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country also plans to build a barbed wire fence along the border with Romania to stop refugees trying to cross their country as the fence on the Serbian border is now completed.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D’Agata reported that even prisoners were on the list of those who helped stretch the barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major weakness and entry point into the European Union for refugees, many of whom have fled Syria and other Middle Eastern countries.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted, however, that most of them are economic migrants who seek a better life, not war refugees who seek protection, a view that is clearly different from other EU states including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, now criminalize violations of the 4-metre fence that the government had erected on the southern border with Serbia, and also set longer jail terms for those who illegally transfer refugees.
"Thanks to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of danger," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
In this we have quite clear: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Technically, parliament still has to approve the deployment of the army, which was expected next week, but Associated Press reporters at the border have been observing a heavily armed army with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n’s domestic defence adviser, said authorities had arrested 45 people who tried to cross the border and 15 had already been arrested in the state.
They have penetrated the fence with damage and are now in police custody accused of committing offences under the new laws.
The authorities quickly allowed the fence to be repaired.
Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after using a barbed-wire tow truck.
At the main border crossing at Roszke there was chaos because the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for processing and there was a crowding of people.
About 20 of them went inside, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of refugees blocked the main highway linking Serbia and Hungary when they refused food and water until they were allowed to cross the border into Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton’s lead over Bernie Sanders halved in national vote
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a two-digit lead in the Democratic nomination race at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up to her lead.
Clinton now supports 47 percent of Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders is in second place with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he wants to become president, is getting support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the main competitions begin, the most democratic voters say it is too early to say that there are clear decisions which candidate they will support.
But Clinton’s sponsors are more confident in their choices than those who support other candidates.
Since last month’s CBS News poll, Clinton has lost ground to several demographic groups, while Sanders has gained several.
Clinton maintains a great lead among women and mitigates, but her leadership is narrowing.
Her support among the men was significantly reduced and Sanders lost only 5 points to her.
Clinton’s advantage with Democratic voters under the age of 50 has faded and now they are equal to Sanders.
But Clinton still has great leadership thanks to older voters.
Last month, Clinton had a double-digit lead over Sanders among the Liberals, but now Sanders is losing only 5 points in this group.
About half of Democratic primary voters in entire states say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became a party candidate.
A quarter would support her with certain reservations, and another 15 percent would support her only for being a candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
It’s no surprise that Clinton’s current supporters are particularly interested in her.
The views are mixed among those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, less Republican voters say the same about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton supporters are asked in an open question as to why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), it follows that it is time to be a woman president (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for this job (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Furthermore, there is a great possibility of choice and agreement on problems.
While the vice president is considering a potential presidential candidacy, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like to be in the lead — a third think he shouldn’t run.
When primary democratic voters were asked who they would choose as the second choice for the party’s nomination, the most common choice was Biden.
More than half of Clinton’s supporters cited Biden as their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton’s leadership will expand from 20 points when Biden runs, to 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election, but that number fell from 78 percent last month.
Biden is far second on this scale, but the percentage of people who see him as the most likely electable is on the rise.
However, when it comes to the question of the greater importance of the candidate, democratic voters prefer problem-solving to a greater chance of being elected.
Like last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate is running as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates, have good results in some key characteristics among the primary voters of their party.
Most see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as honest and credible, and think they have strong leadership qualities.
Biden of all three leads in sincerity, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters don’t think Clinton is honest and credible, twice as many as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don’t.
Primary Democratic voters also generally see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as consistent with their ideological views.
With regard to all these scales, about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion on Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton’s decision to use her personal email and server as secretary of state continue, most primary Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their overall view of her at all.
But among the American public, this is a completely different story.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with its explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinions on this topic were divided as early as March, shortly after the problem emerged.
Most Americans say this email controversy has no impact on their overall view of Clinton, while 36 percent say their view of Clinton has worsened.
They are mostly Republicans, where more than 6 in 10 say their views on Clinton have deteriorated.
Even though Clinton is perceived as honest and credible among her party’s voters, this issue remains a problem among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see her as honest and credible, a drop of eight points from last month, and 15 points from May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not think it is honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country do not see Trump as honest and credible.
But both Clinton and Trump have good marks for leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush were the best.
Sanders sees more people as honest than dishonest, but, as with Carson, a lot of voters didn’t think of him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson ends up with Donald Trump in national elections
Ben Carson Approaches Donald Trump in Latest CBS News/New York Times Survey
Two candidates are responsible for half of the voters in the latest poll, and the rest are left to seek support.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump by a crushing majority, rising from 23% support in the latest CBS poll conducted before the Fox News debate last month, to 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson shot from 6 to 23% in the same period.
The poll also found that Carson is doing well across demographic groups, and disqualifying Trump among college-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Gov. John Kasiche, is behind with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker completely on the verge of 10% support falling to the current 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all in third place with 6%.
The margin of error for a sample of 376 Republican voters in the latest poll is plus minus 6% and took place in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week showed Carson improved to 19% support among Republicans with Trump’s 32% support.
A recent poll from ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Trump is significantly ahead of Carson.
With Carson’s rising trend, Trump decided to blindly shoot a serving neurosurgeon, and Carson even apologized for questioning Trump’s beliefs.
"We need energy," Trump said Saturday during a campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the fraternity accused of the death of a first-year student of Baruch College
Nearly two years after the student died during an overburdened fraternal ritual in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Dogs brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during the opening ceremony in September 2013 and delayed taking him to the hospital, contributing to his death, police said.
Police say he was blindfolded, wore a bag full of sand weighing 30 pounds, and was repeatedly harassed as he tried to reach his destination across a frozen field.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of a headache and then fell unconscious.
Members of the Pi Delta Dogs Brotherhood did not call 911 immediately after Deng passed out, and reportedly waited an hour before being taken to a hospital, police said.
However, they found time to change Dengo’s clothes, google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the fraternity, and ask him for advice, police chief Chris Vagner said at a news conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide the equipment and essentially preferred the welfare of the fraternity over the life of Michael Deng," Chief Wagner said.
He could not be revived and died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly hit by a blunt object in the head, torso and thigh.
"Too many families have been devastated as a result of fraternity overemphasis and at least one student dies each year from overemphasis since 1970," Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Dengo's family, said in a statement.
Fraternity and its members must be accountable, and this step is important on the part of the authorities.
The Monroe County grand jury recommended charges of third-degree murder for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members of the fraternity, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with assault by extortion and criminal association.
“We want to detain not only those involved, but if there is an organization that has approved it, whether officially or unofficially, we will hold them accountable as well,” Wagner told a news conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned fraternity and the national fraternity canceled its relationship with local branches.
This is what happens when the Fed raises interest rates
Interest rates will rise and the bull market will fall, bond yields will rise and the economy will slide into recession.
We know all this.
What we don’t know is how long it will take and how long it will take.
For the economy in particular, the history of a small originator offers about timing.
The recession came 11 months after the first rate hike and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve’s aggressiveness in raising rates is often, though not always, determining how the economy and financial assets will react.
This is why U.S. central bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not be focused on when the rate hikes will begin, but rather on the trajectory, how long the normalization will take.
There are actually more variables in the game.
However, in the end, market members can make sure that all the hype due to the speed increase can be exaggerated.
“The first rise in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of the era of ‘cheap money,’” Julian Jessop, the chief global economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.
By contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to more common but still low levels to create a seismic shock that many might be afraid of.
This means that there will be adverse effects.
Here is a look at how some areas of the economy will react, based on historical trends:
Given what the market has recorded over the past month or so, the expected rate hike can make the air a bit volatile.
But once the increase occurs, the effect will not be so dramatic.
“There seems to be a trend for stock stagnation 12-24 months after the first increase, which may again reflect a delay in monetary policy,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after the Fed raises.
More precisely, the market for the last about 35 years most often - about 14 percent of the management - is aimed at raising rates in relatively flat in 250 days (average increase of 2.6 percent), and then returns back to normal after 500 days, with an average return of 14 percent of the last six years.
Deutsche said the impact on stocks tends to become more pronounced later in the cycle of rate hikes and returns are beginning to decline.
Recession is a fact of economic life, but rising rates often help it.
Currently, the Fed is facing some conditions that have not yet existed and that could hasten a recession.
The most notable is that the gross domestic product neared its lowest point in history when raising Fed rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, during the 118 rate hikes since 1950, the nominal year-on-year GDP growth was only twice below 4.5 percent.
Despite the fact that in the second quarter of 2015, it was 3.6 percent, few expect to keep it, when in the third quarter it was only 1.5 percent, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising rates against this complex economic backdrop could be risky, and the question “is this time different” could arise, Deutsche said.
Market participants were prepared to grow the Fed all year round and all eyes were on the Federal Free Market Committee meeting that took place this week and ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve the increase at this meeting, future trading only indicates a 25 percent probability.
“In our study since the 1950s, all the boost cycles so far have been in a super cycle of leverage increase with GDP covering the peaks of the onset of recession very quickly after the onset of recovery,” the report said.
On the contrary, this was clearly a slow recovery from the worst recession in the sampling period.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, we are now at 74 months, and we are still continuing.
Fixed yield was also volatile as the market expects rates to rise and the pattern is somewhat similar to what stocks experience.
The main difference is that the impact is more noticeable in bonds than in stocks when the Fed changes policy direction.
For bonds, earnings seem to change direction immediately after the first arrival of the increase/decrease cycle.
At the end of the cycle of increase, bond yields fall immediately,” Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab’s strategists believe that rising rates will cause the yields between long- and short-dated bonds to move closer, which equals the curve.
High-yield bonds often work better in this climate, although "we're still careful about tightening returns," Kathy Jones, a firm fixed-income analyst at Schwab, said in her analysis.
Interestingly, Jones thinks the markets are already adjusted to the expectations of the Fed’s policy.
"Besides the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the prospects of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are at the top, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have widened, and volatility has increased — all the characteristics of the market as the Fed tightens policy.
Generally speaking, companies that do most of their business in the U.S. will win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Transnational companies with a lot of debt will do worse because the growing dollar will make their products more expensive in the world market and their debt will also be higher.
“History shows that the ‘quality’ of stocks tends to be surpassed within three months of the initial rate hike,” Goldman Sachsve analysts said in a report for clients.
Firms with strong balance sheets outperformed weak balance sheet companies in each increase in interest rates in 1994, 1999, 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
High-yield companies, as well as low-volatility stocks, also outperformed their lower quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percent points) and 3 (percent points) respectively.
Debt is going to be a big problem.
Companies with high interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
In addition to a purely share-based game, consumers also benefit from the growing dollar.
Economists can also see their gains through higher returns, but experts have differing views on how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham slammed the station for "deceiving"
He believes that he is becoming increasingly indistinguishable from his commercial rival.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards and says they’re just cheating the British.
Colleague Damien Collins attacks Voice and says he's not an original idea either
BBC Radio 3 is "changing" into Classic FM, the leading MP claims, accumulating fresh pressure on the broadcast to prove they're doing something the commercial broadcasters aren't doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC chiefs that the public service radio station appears to be “stunned” and increasingly indistinguishable from its business rival.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I don't like to use the word 'sculpted' - but it seems to be changing to Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, which began in December last year.
The BBC Music Awards, which began last year, seem to be British under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are two examples that come to mind when you're actually just imitating what we already have on the market," Bingham said.
The BBC director general rejected the accusations on the grounds that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival in terms of live music and public education.
What I learned about classical music on Radio 3 I would not have learned on any other radio.
And their commitment to living music and making music is actually at the top level.
“I also think that Radio 3’s commitment to finding new music and putting new works into operation is also very important,” he says.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 regulator Alan Davey argued that it is now necessary to work harder to engage the public than before because the British are less educated about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production that came under fire for trampling on the heels of commercial competitors during Culture, Media and Sport broadcasts and got to the hearing of the commission.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice, a music talent show that the BBC bought from Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
Do you see why this program is discussed as non-original and not particularly different?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - in which stars Paloma Faith and Boy George shine as judges - was produced "in a way typical of the BBC."
He added that he wants the Corporation to "find a hit from its own stable" when it launches a fun series next time.
However, he refused to rule out ordering multiple future series of The Voice or spending taxpayers’ money on licensing fees for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales have been growing at the slowest pace since August, and Black Friday may be to blame
The first three months of 2015 saw a 7% increase in online sales
Last month saw the lowest growth since records began in 2000.
Internet sales were boosted three years ago thanks to mobile shopping
Experts believe November's Black Friday could be a reason to slow spending
Virtual shopping has been on the rise for more than a decade and has made many of Britain’s main streets into ghost towns.
However, experts say there are signs of steady online sales, and new data show a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending for August represented the lowest growth since the beginning of the measurements in 2000, with an increase of only 5 percent compared to the previous year.
Experts say there are signs of steady online sales, and new data show a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
“When you look at the level of growth over the past years and go back to the year 2000, that state has always rationalized over time,” Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG Revenue Index, told the Guardian.
He explains that online sales were boosted three years ago when customers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that people were able to shop online and that they were able to make purchases in different contexts, such as on the sofa.
But now (growth) is somewhat stagnant, and therefore it seems to reverberate.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was taken over from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
Experts believe that customers may be able to abstain from shopping before this event, which takes place last Friday in November.
Last year, five times more than the average number of shoppers turned to their computers to make purchases while discarding several vendor websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, thanks to which buyers are contracting again, can keep customers from further purchases
Research published by the British Retail Consortium found that only <0xC2><0xA3>1 of every <0xC2><0xA3>5 was spent online.
For some products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of sales are made through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online, instead of shopping in stone fashion stores.
Muslims Buried Victims of Crane Crash in Mecca and Bin Laden Family Sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead were taken to the streets by Muslims during the first funeral in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia is partly to blame for the collapse of the Saudi Binladin Group.
The Ministry of Health said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims of the crane crash at the Grand Mosque in Mecca, carrying the bodies of the victims on the street.
Dressed to a certain extent in white, the mourners chose their way and paid tribute to the victims when the first of the fallen got on his last trip to the cemetery in Al-Moaissem.
A sad message passed around the holy place, where just a few days earlier a construction crane had broken through the ceiling of the mosque and fell on the believers.
The bodies were released for burial and the Saudi king sanctioned the bin Laden family's construction group over the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 dead after a crane crashed at the Grand Central Mosque in Mecca
Among the dead was the father of four children, Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Machester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was in the Grand Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi officials have already promised that the hajj will be held in Mecca and thousands of people will continue to descend into the city.
King Salman said today that the Binadin Group should not leave the crane's shoulder on top when it was not in operation.
The Arabic version of the decree, carried by the Saudi state-run news agency, states that Binladin Group is partly to blame for the fall.
The record agency's English service did not report this detail, but said the company's chiefs were banned from traveling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to uncover what caused the crane to fall into the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims are covering before the Hajj pilgrimage later this month.
The Binladin Group did not make any statements about the collapse of the crane and were not made available to its representatives for comment.
The Royal Decrees also accused the group of not using the latest security measures, and a lack of coordination with meteorological officials.
Dozens of cranes surround the Grand Mosque in Mecca, which is part of a massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
Binladi's family has been close to the Saudi ruling family for decades and is running major construction projects.
The late al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was the son of an apostate whose family renounced him in the 1990s.
The accident took place amid strong winds and rains just days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom on a pilgrimage that every capable Muslim must undertake at least once in his life.
Officials say 158 people are still in the hospital.
Officials have determined that one million riyals (<0xC2><0xA3>174,000) will be devoted to the relatives of the killed, and the same amount for the permanently injured.
Other injuries will receive half of that amount.
The head of B&Q claims that Eastern European traders working for cheap are already trending
The British are increasingly employing craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of trained traders from Eastern Europe is at a point of growth
The result is 200 open Screwfix trades aimed at traders
Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q outlets across the country
Edited by Rupert Steiner, chief correspondent for the Daily Mail
The British are reportedly laying down hammers and brushes and handing them over to employed trained East European craftsmen to work at their home.
If you do it with a hammer or a paintbrush, you seem to be in the minority today.
Because the British are increasingly employing craftsmen to carry out cutlery work at their home, according to the head of the company behind Screwfix B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns a chain for domestic needs, says that a large increase in the number of trained traders from Eastern Europe offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more merchant-focused Screwfix stores and close 60 B&Q outlets.
Ms. Laury says she wants to hire more women in B&Q stores because eight out of ten shopping decisions in the store make better halves.
Currently, most of the workers are male.
She said there is a need to address growing demographic trends that show more women’s households making more home adjustments than in the past.
Mrs. Laury says: "We still have men working in our shops.
We need to get closer to balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women, who make 80% of the decisions regarding the purchase of goods.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Laury, who is one of only five women at the helm of leading companies according to the British FTSE100 index, has also restructured her top team to reflect the equivalence of directors between men and women.
Kingfisher stands almost alone in having half the representation of women among employees, including the executive and financial director.
Ms Laury says: "It was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here.
So it wasn't hard to find the good women we'd take with us.
Kingfisher reported a decline in both profits in the middle of the year and sales after the group took on the costs of closing trades.
The result of the Kingfisher trend, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, is to open 200 new stores
The December contribution of 600 CZK to pensioners is in jeopardy.
"It is the justice of equal stomachs, it has nothing to do with human justice," said Miroslav Kalousek, vice-president of TOP 09, who emphasized the principle of merit.
Zbyn<0xC4><0x9B>k Stanjura, the chairman of the ODS MPs, noted that the one-time contribution sounds good, but in the long run it would be better to have it in standard valorization, because it would be projected into the next years.
"We have room to find a mechanism to do this," Stanjura said.
He supported the original proposal by Minister Michaela Marx (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), according to which it should be valued beyond the law next year.
Marx defended the subsidy with the argument that it would improve the social situation of pensioners, which she said was not pink.
Higher valuations next year would have a budget impact of CZK 5.5 billion, and ministers are debating every hundred million.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) reminded the right that in the past the rate of valorization has decreased.
Reporter Miroslav Op<0xC3><0xA1>lka (KS<0xC4><0x8C>M) pointed out that the proposal does not address the reduction of real pensions in 2016 and later.
The right-wing veto will significantly complicate and perhaps even make it impossible to pay in December, he said.
The chairman of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD members Roman Sklen<0xC3><0xA1>k therefore proposed to shorten the deadline for the discussion of the standard in the committee to ten or 20 days, even the right blocked it.
The committee will have one month instead of the usual two.
The bonus should cost a total of CZK 1.73 billion.
The money should mainly come from the budget of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
Next year, pensions are expected to increase by an average of about a hundred crowns.
According to the pension amendment, the contribution should be paid to people who will be entitled to a pension or part of it in December.
It could also be obtained by those who lost their pension entitlement in December before it was paid.
However, they would have to request the surcharge in writing, not later than the end of the next year.
In the Czech Republic, pensions are valued regularly by January, due to rising prices and a third of real wage growth.
This year’s pension corresponds to 41.5 percent of gross wages, next year it should be 40.5 percent.
The state spent 314.7 billion crowns on old-age pensions last year, according to the state final account, which was about five billion more annually.
Expenditure on old-age pensions accounted for 26 percent of all budget expenditures and 46 percent of all statutory expenditures.
The average full old-age pension last year rose by 104 to CZK 10,714, according to data in the state final account.
The Czech Social Security Administration ensured the payment of 2.4 million full old-age pensions and approximately 17,000 proportional pensions.
Yakunin has abandoned plans for a political career, will devote himself to science.
According to Russian media, the Senate seat was almost certain for the billionaire.
In the Council of the Federation was to represent the Zapadorian Kaliningrad region, whose governor Nikolai Tsukanov as a candidate of the ruling party of the United Russia defended his position in Sunday's elections with an overview.
According to Russian law, senators are not elected by citizens, but are chosen by the governor from among three candidates whose names are announced before the governor's election.
After the election, he will elect a senator from among the three candidates.
A complication for Jakunin was the fact that he did not live in the Kaliningrad region for twenty years, as required by law.
Although the Kremlin has found an exception for Jakunin, he is an extraordinary and authorized ambassador, to whom the legal requirement of a long-term stay does not apply.
The filming of the Czech comedy Theory of the Tiger is over.
The last drop in the main hero's agenda is the voluntary death of his father-in-law, who has lost his strength and patience.
Grandma - Iva Jan<0xC5><0xBE>urov<0xC3><0xA1> decided on her grandfather's life, age and funeral.
It is clear to Jan that he and his wife Olga - Eli<0xC5><0xA1>ka Balzerov<0xC3><0xA1> are on a similar journey.
He remembers that once he had his own will and dreams, he wants to live with dignity and freedom again.
He wants to regain control of his life - and as a solution he will choose to escape from the present, Slav<0xC3><0xAD>k pointed out to the story.
Bajgar wanted to capture in a comedy form a certain type of relationship in which one of the partners does not feel completely free.
From the beginning, it was clear that the main role will be played by Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ek, with whom he has already collaborated on the series Invisible.
However, the actor, who appeared in front of the camera after a long break associated with recovery after a serious illness, surprised him.
We had an agreement three years ago.
I let him read the script and he said he liked how sad he was.
And I'm surprised he's probably a dolled-up athlete.
Before that, he always asked where he would sit before shooting another scene.
This time he rode his bike, climbed the rocks and even went up the hill.
And all this in record-breaking tropical heats, the director said.
According to Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ka, women take a tiger to turn it into a rabbit over time.
They'll give him some food, but they'll close the door so he doesn't think he's going to play tiger outside the rabbit house.
And that’s what we’re trying to tell our film about, the actor commented.
Eli<0xC5><0xA1>ka Balzerov<0xC3><0xA1> portrayed his wife, who may have a slightly negative effect on the audience.
She's not just a negative character.
She is also pleasant, intelligent, empathetic and thinks well.
But at the same time, she is a usurper and wants to bury her husband to death, Bajgar said.
The film also depicts the fates of Jan's married daughters Olinka and Alice - T<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x88>a Vilhelmov<0xC3><0xA1> and Pavla Beretov<0xC3><0xA1> - and sons-in-laws Erik and Pep<0xC3><0xAD>k - Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Havelka and Jakub Koh<0xC3><0xA1>k.
The film is produced by Petr Erben from Logline Production, co-producers Czech Television and Radio and Television Slovakia.
Google has pledged millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
The U.S. Internet company Google has pledged to provide an additional $5.5 million to organizations that help thousands of refugees fleeing to Europe.
It was announced on Tuesday by Google.org, which is a charitable outgrowth of the internet company.
Azerbaijan has canceled part of the visit to Teli<0xC4><0x8D> for criticizing human rights violations.
Czech MEP for the ANO movement Pavel Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ka has postponed his upcoming trip to Baku on Thursday because Azerbaijani authorities canceled the official part of his visit today.
According to Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ka, Baku is justified by last week's EP resolution, which criticizes human rights violations in Azerbaijan and in which Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ka was a co-author.
With the decision of the Azerbaijani Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ka party, he missed the possibility of interviews with official partners and also the visit of political prisoners, which depends on the approval of the authorities, his Brussels office explained in a press statement.
The trip, which was planned several months in advance, wanted to use Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ka to meet with the leaders of the parliament and representatives of the executive, as well as with representatives of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners, the text sent by the Czech Republic.
The resolution condemns "unprecedented repression against civil society in Azerbaijan".
It called on European leaders to consider sanctions against all politicians, officials and judges involved in political persecution.
The resolution was passed shortly after a recent verdict on Azerbaijani opposition journalist Khadija Ismail, who advocated for the detection of corruption in government circles.
Russia does not rule out building an air base in Syria.
Bogdanovsky did not rule out the possibility of a Russian air base in Syria in the future when he visited Novosibirsk.
We don't have plans like that yet.
Nothing is excluded, he said.
Russia has had a naval base in Syria for years in the port of Tartus, which it has used as a service and logistics center.
According to Russian media reports, deliveries of Russian weapons and military material to Syria have risen since the beginning of August.
According to Moscow, these are arms shipments resulting from the current trade agreements.
The Pentagon says the Russians are planning to establish an air base near the city of Latakia, which remains the stronghold of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for the time being.
Washington, however, is not entirely clear about Russia’s specific military intentions in Syria, U.S. commentators agree.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry spoke on Tuesday with Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov about the situation in Syria, their third telephone conversation in ten days.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is on his way to Moscow next week to express concern over the gathering of a Russian arsenal near Israel.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Assad’s support for Moscow was a loss.
He said Russia’s policy in Syria was rather unclear.
Moscow has made its own satellite from Syria.
It may mean that President Vladimir Putin is pursuing a rather long-term goal, but what, according to Earnest, is not entirely clear.
The war in Syria is expected to be the main topic of Putin’s speech at the upcoming UN General Assembly meeting in New York, according to Russian media speculation.
On the contrary, the Russian leader does not intend to speak at all about the situation in the Ukrainian Donbas.
According to a report by The New York Times, the U.S. government does not rule out a meeting between President Barack Obama and the Russian president during a U.N. meeting.
However, the White House’s advisers disagreed.
TASS quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying that Putin has not yet scheduled a meeting with Obama on his New York stay.
Put sesame oil on a gallbladder diet, hemp helps boost immunity.
A good way to increase the intake of beneficial unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits is to use extra virgin oils.
When pressing from seeds in the cold, all healthy substances will remain in the oil.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of a health diet, for example, gallbladder.
Some extra virgin oils are suitable for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
According to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic, these are the most common cause of death for Czechs for several years.
Inflammation of the gallbladder mainly affects women, helps sesame oil.
If you are one of the lovers of Asian cuisine, you should not miss the sesame oil in the pantry, which is part of the original recipes for exotic dishes.
Unlike most other oils, it can also be used in the heat treatment of dishes and has a number of beneficial health effects.
It is often used in a gallbladder diet.
The essential fatty acids it contains are a good prevention of the formation of bile stones.
These are 90% of the cause of biliary inflammation and women suffer from these difficulties 3 times more often than men.
In general, problems with the gallbladder mainly affect overweight people who do not exercise and consume a lot of animal fats.
Sesame oil can also be successfully used in a liver diet, which is very similar to that of gallbladder.
If people want to take advantage of all the health benefits of consuming this oil, they should be wary of goods from exotic food stores.
Manufacturers from Asia often use roasted seeds for pressing, which have a more pronounced taste.
But the oil will lose all the active substances, described Ladislav Ha<0xC4><0x8D>eck<0xC3><0xBD>, executive director of the Czech company Bohemia Oil from Kraslice in Sokolovska, which produces organic virgin cold pressed oils.
The company also produces sesame oil and uses exclusively unroasted white sesame seeds.
In an hour, our press will be able to squeeze out 8 kilos of sesame.
With mechanical pressing, the raw material is heated to a maximum of 40 degrees, and therefore the product meets the criteria for the designation extra virgin.
At higher temperatures, there would be a loss of nutrients.
Sunflower oil is beneficial for diseases of the heart and blood vessels.
The Czech favorite among oils is sunflower.
Jarmila Hamersk<0xC3><0xA1>, a researcher at Masaryk University, found that 43% of respondents preferred it in a warm kitchen.
However, it is not really suitable for frying, already at 180 ° C it starts to burn over.
It is better to use it, for example, to preserve salads and is especially suitable in a diet in which it helps in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
It contains a high proportion of omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids, which of all fatty acids reduce cholesterol levels the most.
In case of heart problems, you need to pay attention to the amount of fat and calories consumed.
For example, in one tablespoon of sunflower oil there are 62 calories, in a tablespoon of rapeseed oil there are 99 calories.
As for the energy value of food, it is important to remember that natural foods with nutrients are much more suitable than so-called empty calories.
These are part of industrially modified products.
Therefore, it is advisable to reach for extra virgin oils.
This sunflower will last as long as sesame and hemp for 9 months.
By storing it in the refrigerator, the shelf life is extended.
Old oil people will recognize especially by its bitter taste.
On the contrary, the fault is not at the bottom.
It's a sign that the substance wasn't chemically refined.
Hemp oil contains the most healthy acids.
The seeds of technical hemp belong to the so-called superfoods, and therefore hemp oil is considered the healthiest of vegetable oils.
This designation is due to the highest content of omega 3 and omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids cannot be produced by the body on their own, and a person must take them from food.
Particularly important is the intake of omega 3 fatty acids.
A study by scientists published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition has shown that daily intake of this substance is insufficient.
Men in France and Greece consume 0.6 grams of it, while Icelanders take 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
It is advisable to include hemp oil in the diet as part of a supportive diet to strengthen immunity and heal wounds.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential part of cell membranes.
People do not have to worry about the use of hemp oil, it does not contain any psychoactive substances.
The fact that this oil has found its way to consumers is confirmed by the fact that Bohemia Oil is one of the best-selling companies.
It sells 500 liters a year.
People often take one spoonful fasting in the morning.
Hemp oil is not in any way significant in taste, but it will greatly strengthen immunity, advised Daniel Vl<0xC4><0x8D>ek from Bohemia Olej.
According to statistics, the most ardent nation of grillers are Americans.
There is a 1.4 grill per household.
Around the world, there are various competitions in barbecue, which only confirm the success of this culinary discipline.
There are no Czechs behind.
Based on consumer surveys of the Czech market, we find that only 4% of people have never grilled in their lives.
The vast majority of them also grill several times a year.
In order for grilling to be successful, we should not underestimate the preparation - it is ideal to marinate the meat a few hours before heat treatment.
Which oil is most suitable for this and at the same time will leave a beneficial substance to the health when grilling?
In general, during the grilling process itself, fat should be saved.
Experts agree that a large part of the oils begins to lose their taste at high temperatures.
Healthy extra virgin oils then also lose the body of beneficial substances, which we otherwise get from them when consuming oils from dishes prepared at lower temperatures.
However, this does not mean that extra virgin oils will not be used when grilling.
Grape oil for grilling, health and beauty.
When it comes to meat, experts from the company Bohemia Olej from Kraslice in Sokolovskoe will be immediately equipped with grape oil.
It perfectly complements the taste of meat and fish.
In the kitchen, it is characterized by a unique feature of increasing the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for frying and grilling, as it has a high degree of combustion, up to 216 °C.
Even at such a high temperature, therefore, as one of the few oils, it retains a beneficial substance for the health, describes the benefits of Daniel Vl<0xC4><0x8D>ek grape oil from the company Bohemia Olej, which belongs to a few Czech producers of this wine grape oil.
Experts agree that grape oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
Furthermore, it contains a high amount of linoleic acid, and is therefore effective in combating excess cholesterol.
In grape oil, our body also receives important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
Thanks to the beneficial content of these substances, it helps to lower high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
By consuming grape oil we also help to increase our external beauty - it improves the elasticity of the skin, is used in the treatment of acne and helps in the care of dry and brittle hair.
Chefs praise the use of grape oil in the kitchen.
It is not only suitable for the preparation of cold dishes, for example, while preserving salads, but also for the heat treatment of dishes.
There are two ways to use the grill: marinating and grilling itself.
By marinating meat and fish, we preserve their juiciness.
Three ingredients must be present in the preparation of the marinade: oil, acidity and spices.
Add, for example, apple cider vinegar to soften the meat.
The spice in turn adds flavor to the meat and preserves the oil and delivers the right cut, advises Daniel Vl<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
At the same time, it adds that grape oil is ideal for marinating directly because as one of the few oils it can penetrate through dark meat.
So marinated meat or fish are ready for grilling, how to proceed?
Extra virgin oils are characterized by the fact that only a few drops are enough to prepare meals.
The same goes for grilling.
Some oils are completely taboo for this method of preparation.
This is especially true of flax, hemp and rapeseed oils, which should not be heated at all.
Before grilling, rub the grill with oil to prevent the food from burning.
An essential part of grilling is also the preparation of attachments.
Almost anything is suitable for grilled meat and fish - grilled vegetables, baked bread, light vegetable salad and many more.
Chefs from Bohemia Oil recommend, for example, lettuce Hot Summer.
For it you need: • 1 piece of peach • 1 volume of rucola • 1 cup of chopped cucumber • 1 cup of a mixture of salad leaves • 3 tablespoons of grape oil
In a large bowl, add to the mixture of lettuce leaves, chopped cucumbers, and chopped peaches.
Salt and pepper to taste, you can also season with ground chili and soy sauce.
Finally, drizzle with a few drops of grape oil.
For an exceptional taste, you can sprinkle the salad with finely chopped almonds.
Multiple sclerosis: not only depends on the medication, but also on the patient's willingness to fight.
Multiple sclerosis is a complicated disease and a person with this diagnosis needs the care of a number of specialists: a neurologist, a physiotherapist, an occupational therapist, a urologist, an ophthalmologist, a psychologist, a psychiatrist and many other specialists.
However, it is not just about medical care, for example, women with multiple sclerosis also need consultations, if they decide to have a child, social legal advice, recommendations for housing adjustment, etc.
However, all this is not enough: the development of the disease can significantly affect the patient himself.
The more he actively fights the disease, the longer he can work and does not have to fundamentally change his lifestyle.
As doctors warn, the passivity of the sick frees up space for the activity of the disease.
For example, it has been shown that regular movement significantly delays the time when the patient needs some compensatory aid, such as a stick.
It is important that patients and their surroundings are not subjected to various myths, for example, that the disease automatically leads them to end up in a wheelchair.
This is why the website Dej si chanci (www.bezmytu.cz) was created, which is supported by the ongoing media campaign Dej si chanci.
The most important person in the care of a patient with multiple sclerosis is a neurologist.
For multiple sclerosis, there is a double saying that the sooner the disease begins to be treated, the more the doctor can influence something.
This is because we have drugs for multiple sclerosis in the inflammatory stage, when the process of neurodegeneration is not yet so strong.
The sooner we intervene, the greater the hope that we will be able to stop the disease and delay disability, explains MUDr. Eva Medov<0xC3><0xA1> from the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
It is very important for people with multiple sclerosis rehabilitation care, which most often addresses the weakening of the lower limbs or the disturbance of balance.
They work with patients according to their individual needs: to maintain fitness, improve walking, strengthen the pelvic floor, alleviate swallowing disorders or improve coordination.
"It's really individual, it depends on the specific problems of the patient," says MUDr. Martina Köv<0xC3><0xA1>ri, Principal of the Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine Clinic of the Faculty Hospital in Motol.
People with multiple sclerosis suffer from the same disease, but it manifests itself in a slightly different way.
Rehabilitation cannot stop the disease, but it can always alleviate its symptoms.
Movement activity, however, also strengthens the immune state of the body, which is desirable in the case of multiple sclerosis.
Another positive thing about regular exercise is that the patients check what they can do, and this strengthens their self-confidence.
"When exercising, endorphins are also released and one feels good after it," points out Dr. Kamila <0xC5><0x98>asov<0xC3><0xA1> from the Rehabilitation Medicine Clinic of the Royal Vinohrady Faculty Hospital.
By influencing the physical side, we act on the limbic system responsible for emotions.
This is how we intervene in the psyche and immune processes and stabilize the disease, he adds.
"In the past, these patients were so-called spared, today we know that they need a targeted load," says Prof. PaedDr. Pavel Kol<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>, head of the Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine Clinic of the Faculty Hospital in Motole.
The goal of physiotherapy is to allow a person to remain as self-sufficient as possible, including work placement.
Physiotherapists therefore work with ergotherapists so that each person receives a compensatory aid tailored to him.
Many patients also need the care of a psychologist or psychiatrist.
They are in a difficult life situation.
When a serious illness comes into your life, most people will be shocked.
They experience shock, panic, fear.
It has to respond to a great burden - loss of health.
With such a sore soul, we have to go after someone, not try to carry everything on our own shoulders.
"I work with them to finally conclude that even with a disability you can live a full life and that multiple sclerosis does not mean the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata Malinov<0xC3><0xA1> - Schubertov<0xC3><0xA1> from the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
Without the Prague-based manufacturer Latecoere, the Airbuses would not have flown.
Aircraft manufacturing is synonymous with precision and advanced technologies.
The new aircraft are full of titanium or light and solid composite materials, which no one can manufacture and process immediately.
Still, next to super-precise, computer-controlled machining machines, next to autoclaves for forming composites, you can come across something as ordinary as apricot picks.
In the drum, which resembles a pot of sugar wadding, the edges of the sheet metal parts that have just come out of the milling machine are grinded in a pile of ovens.
"No one has come up with anything better so far," smiles Ivan Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD>, CEO of the aerial door manufacturer Latecoere Czech Republic.
At the site in Prague Let<0xC5><0x88>any, the former Letov manufactures complete doors for the Airbus A320.
As the only one in the world, they supply the doors for the Brazilian Embraer 170.
Through the doors, part of which is assembled in Prague, passengers also enter the first and higher class on the upper decks of the world’s largest transport aircraft Airbus A380.
There are also doors full of composites for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Accuracy is the main motto here.
For example, the company lets you adjust the torque keys twice a year.
If the yellow sticker lacks a check record, they should explain something to the auditors at the Prague plant, Airbus or Boeing, who travel regularly to check if the doors are manufactured according to the agreed rules.
However, the human senses have not yet been completely replaced by advanced technology.
There are 1500 rivets on one door to the A320.
The riveters have to open manually.
It takes them two days.
Even by the sound of the hammer hitting, they will know if the rivet is already properly broken.
The tolerance in which they move is minimal.
The nave can rise above the surface of the aircraft from zero to 0.13 millimeters.
That's about twice the thickness of human hair.
During the check, a trained touch comes to mind.
When the controller swipes through a row of rivets, it will see if any are out of tolerance.
After that, he takes the exact deflector in his hand.
Before 1989, Letov fed the training program of the L-39 military aircraft.
However, not one was produced in 1991.
The company had to find new jobs quickly.
At that time, it merged with the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
She won a tender for an emergency door supplier for the A321.
The interviews with Boeing were not so happy.
“We were a small company for them at the time, which did not have enough money to invest and to guarantee stable long-term deliveries to Boeing,” Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> recalls.
The door to the American manufacturer would have been locked if Letov had not joined the French group Latecoere at the 1999 Prague conference of the International Aviation Industry Association.
I was talking about our cooperation with Airbus.
The next day, negotiations with the French began, Dubsky said.
A year later Latecoere bought the Czech company and with a strong company came new orders.
In 2000, the installation of door parts for the A320 began.
Three years later, the top deck door for the A380 was added.
In 2006, the company built a new composite processing hall for supplies for the Boeing Dreamliner.
Without Latecoere, we wouldn't be able to get to these big jobs ourselves.
Maybe we'd make parts or small parts.
The partners want a guarantee of supply for twenty or thirty years, Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> explains.
Last year, Czech company Latecoere achieved a turnover of more than 2.9 billion and a profit after tax of 147 million CZK.
The exclusive position among the suppliers of aircraft manufacturers is not free.
Latecoere has invested CZK 1.5 billion in Prague since 2000.
The company must have quality certificates, certification of 170 special production processes and qualification certificates for key employees.
Without them, the company would not have produced any doors for airplanes.
Obtain certificates that the production processes meet the requirements of customers, and in repeated inspections they cost according to Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> millions of crowns.
Production processes change every year.
They are more accurate and strict.
We need to train employees, re-equip the equipment and re-certify the whole process, Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> adds.
Now the company is finalizing the process for zinc and nickel plating, which will replace the previously harmful cadmium for human health.
They received the assignments from the manufacturer, but then had to adapt the technology for the equipment or chemicals they use in Prague.
People from Boeing will come and check the concept of the entire line.
Then we will show them the production.
They'll check our lab, too.
They test one set of samples themselves in their own lab and then compare the results with ours, bringing Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> closer to the way customers control them.
The reward is the Prague company’s long-term exclusive contracts.
With the Prague plant today, the production of embraers stands and falls.
For the A320, it produces half of the total door volume.
Replace Czech Latecoere is either impossible or very difficult for a Brazilian or European manufacturer.
But that doesn’t mean he can say anything at the door.
Part of the contract is the price curve.
This indicates how many doors will stand after ten, fifty, a hundred made pieces.
The price per piece always drops to a certain limit value.
We need to fit into this price formula.
If not, we will lose, says Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Half of the hall, where the electrical cabinets for the Airbus A400 M military aircraft are assembled, is so far empty.
It is a symbol of the future.
Behind the curtain, a new semi-robot riveting and door assembly line is being built for the innovative A320 Neo.
The riveting speeds up and refines.
"This is the trend that assembly in aviation is taking," Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> adds.
The sale has a future line secured.
Airbus says airlines have ordered 3,278 new A320s so far.
Just a few metres away will be a complete door assembly line for the A380 top deck.
It is a strategic decision of our parent company.
The aim is to shorten production times and reduce costs.
Full assembly could begin in two years, Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> says.
Before that, however, the company has to pass qualification tests, for example, for the installation of certain electrical and electronic equipment in the doors for the largest Airbus.
The company is also betting on the further development of production from composite materials.
In addition to Boeing, it should also participate in the new Airbus A350 program, which will compete with the American Dreamliner.
"It is a huge credit for the company when it can process composites in addition to metal materials," says Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> proudly.
However, in the Czech Republic, latecoere reaches the edge of production capacity.
In the Letov area where he lives, there is no other place.
Before the entry of the French mother, the company had 180 employees.
Now there are 800 of them, and in three years there could be a hundred more.
As long as Airbus and Boeing are ahead of how many hundreds of new aircraft the airlines order each year, they don’t have to worry about work.
Although he has contracts for several years in advance, the parent company of Prague’s Latecoere faced the threat of bankruptcy.
The French group did not have enough money for September's loan instalments.
In the end, Latecoere was able to negotiate with the main creditors.
At the end of August, she exchanged some of the loans for shares.
The creditors gained a 37.4 per cent share in the company by increasing the capital by 57.4 million euros.
The company’s debt fell by two-thirds, or <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>180 million.
The second part of the financial recovery came in early September.
The company has subscribed to new shares among the existing shareholders for 222.9 million euros.
In total, it raised capital by <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>280 million.
The entire group is benefiting from the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, which account for 85 percent of revenue.
Average contract growth is expected to be 4% per annum by 2017.
In the order book, he has orders for 2.6 billion euros, which corresponds to four years of production.
French media say that the latecoere can finally breathe again after years on the drops.
The Czech race in Prague Let<0xC5><0x88>any is important for groups.
It contributes 16 percent to the group’s revenues.
According to the number of employees, it is the largest foreign branch of the group.
MEPs supported a larger share of the state's coal fees.
The change in mining fees is expected to bring CZK 427 million more to the treasury than in 2013.
According to the government, the revenues of the budgets of the municipalities should have a neutral impact, because the fee is to be higher.
In the previous year, the municipalities received about 450 million CZK from the fees and the state budget 150 million CZK.
About CZK 200 million went to the municipalities and CZK 66 million to the state.
The amendment also envisages an increase in the remuneration of mining areas with permitted mining to one thousand crowns per hectare per year.
Income from these payments shall continue to belong to the municipalities to the full extent.
Industry Minister Jan Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) told MPs that the municipalities would receive 14 million to 100 million crowns per year instead.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but will be determined by the government by its regulations.
The payment will be recalculated as a result of the quantity of minerals extracted and the rates for each type of minerals.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
ODS MP Marek Benda warned, however, that setting a fee by government regulation may not be in line with the constitution.
According to Minister Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dko, however, this is not a tax in this case, because the state charges minerals that are state property.
Fees are paid only to municipalities whose territories are affected by mining.
In the case of deep coal mining, three quarters of the municipality’s money and a quarter of the state will be given.
The same ratio will be in the case of the mining of radioactive rocks.
The part of the money that the state collects on mining fees will be tied to the purpose.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair the damage after mining or to provide mining rescue services.
The proposal was criticised today by opposition MPs, who claimed in particular that it would harm the communities affected by mining and the region.
For example, Michal Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as before, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to improve the budget," David K<0xC3><0xA1>dner, elected in the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> region, said.
KS<0xC4><0x8C>M MP Hana Aulick<0xC3><0xA1> warned of the increase in unemployment in Mostek.
Kadner and Aulicka unsuccessfully proposed to reject the amendment, and Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era wanted to return the law to the government for revision.
The reasoning states that, according to mining companies, the increase in fees will not be reflected in the price of coal, as prices are negotiated from more than 90 percent over the long term.
Therefore, the main consumers such as power plants or thermal power plants should not feel the price increase.
"On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organizations will compensate for increases in remuneration by trying to reduce their operating expenses, which would primarily mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government admits.
However, it considers the increase in fees in terms of employment to be bearable.
According to the rapporteur for the amendment, Milan Urban (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), it is crucial that MPs know the conclusions on the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decisions on the limits of coal production before the adoption of the law.
If coal is to be mined beyond limits, then it will have an impact on revenues for the state and municipalities, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dko that the decision to break the limit at the bottom of the Czechoslovak army should fall only after 2020.
According to him, the limits at the bottom of <0xC4><0x8C>SA should be broken for social, national and economic reasons, as well as for the long-term stability of domestic energy.
Time to decide on interest rates for the U.S. Federal Reserve
The entire world is watching the US Federal Reserve plan to meet in two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a crucial decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
A survey of 80 economists by Reuters found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would make a decision now think they will remain idle for some time and keep interest rates between 0 and 0.25 percent.
It’s a historic event because it’s been a year since the Fed lowered rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central bank could be able to get off the ground and start the process of normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubide, head of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has been doing fairly well, recovering in the form of adding trillions of dollars to the state account and creating only a low level of inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy global outlook.
They warned markets to be prepared for the increase, but the circumstances indicate that they also see great chances against this step.
The decision is to be notified on Thursday at 20:00 CET.
The shooter at Delta State University left a message
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday - and later that day his colleague - wrote a message claiming he was "pity" for the first murder and wishing he could take it back, government officials revealed on Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, a professor of geography and social sciences at Delta State University, called the police on Monday morning at about 10 a.m.
And he said he shot someone.
Lamb asked the dispatcher to send a policeman to his house.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and also mentioned that there is a "cute dog" in the house that "will not bother anyone" but is upset.
The police requested the name of the caller, but Lamb did not introduce himself.
Lamb also did not explain why the house was shot.
When police arrived at the scene, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a handwritten message from Lamb saying, “I’m so sorry and wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy and she’s the only person who ever loved me.”
After leaving the message, Lamb embarked on a 300-mile journey to Delta University, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt and then took his own life.
University Dean William LaForge said he did not know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "there was obviously something going on in Mr Lamb's head."
Despite Monday's statement that Lamb allegedly believed in Amy Prentiss's romantic relationship with Schmidt, government officials said there was "no evidence" for the "love triangle."
Shawn O'Steen, who was married to Prentiss for over seven years, said she was "a great person."
The divorce took place 15 years ago, but the two remained friends.
The 19-year-old daughter of O'Steen and Prentiss was "shocked" by the whole case.
O'Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Linsday Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss's, according to the Sun Herald, Prentiss worked from home over the Internet.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Blitz, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"She's always wanted to help others," Knowles said.
Police said Lamb spoke to his relatives on Monday and said he "will not go to jail."
When police reached him on the highway near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and fled to the woods where he shot himself.
According to a resume he published on the school’s website, Lamb earned a PhD in education at Delta University in the spring of 2015.
Stars who have lost their magic
The actor (left), in a picture with his son Redmond (right), has several stressful years behind him.
In 2001, he struggled with leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his longtime partner Farrah Fawcett to cancer.
The actor also allegedly had a drug problem and was arrested in 2008 for possession of drugs.
All of these things certainly take their toll.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United will be out of the game for several months due to a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg during the defeat of Manchester United in the Champions League against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left defender left this injury in tears and knocked him out of the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The injury was caused by a reckless operation by Hector Moren in the 15th minute when 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV.
He was treated on the pitch for nine minutes and also needed an oxygen mask before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He suffered a double leg fracture and is now in the hospital."
He'll be transported tomorrow or maybe the next day and then operated on in Manchester.
It's terrible - the boy who comes to Manchester at 18 years old has it very hard, but he plays fantastically and then this happens.
When he was in the locker room, he also had an oxygen mask on.
Crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double leg fracture will require six months of treatment and won't be able to play in the group stage.
I think he will still be playing this season.
Moreno was lucky he didn't get a red card and a penalty kick.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gall suggested that the Italian referee was wrong.
You can decide for yourself whether it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a very ugly procedure with both feet.
Tweet from Shawa's account says, "Thank you all for their news, words can't express how devastated I am, my journey to recovery begins now and I'll be back even stronger."
Related: Manchester United recorded the injury of Luke Shaw in the defeat against PSV
The English defender will have added motivation to the recovery in the form of the European Championships in France next July.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said: "It was a very nasty injury."
When any player leaves the field with such an injury, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the goal of our players to hurt their opponents.
Moreno suffered a broken leg in a game for Mexico against Van Gaal's Netherlands at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very difficult for him because his intention was not to hurt the opponent, and when you hear about the severity of such an injury, it's not good," Cocu said.
I wasn’t able to see this moment.
I only saw the ball moving in a different direction, so it looked like [Moreno] touched it, but I didn't see an operation on Luke.
In an interview with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how he feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
I feel really bad about it, I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after surgery by Chris Smalling.
Does David Cameron know the Lorax better?
This is something every parent knows: when a child falls in love with a book, it doesn’t take long to learn it almost from memory.
You must not be David Cameron, of course.
At the request of the provider of children's schemes to name the favorite children's book, he chose Prime Minister Lorax, a fairy tale by Dr. Seusse from 1971.
It was hard to choose, Cameron writes in a report posted on SuperCamps’ website, and continues: “Funny, touching, creative, and with strong content, I loved reading to my children because there was always a picture or message behind it that I hadn’t seen before.”
Well, only then that in the following paragraph Cameron allegedly described the story of the book by the elevator from the 2012 film, which added additional characters and details to fill in the brief original text.
"In the city of Thneed-Ville surrounded by a wall, where all nature ceased to exist in 1991, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to get the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling her wish to see the real tree, the object of the land, which is a short story in the book."
As if it were not suspicious enough, the text supplied by Cameroon is read as a summary elevator of the film Lorax, which is located on the Internet Movie Database, and begins with the words: "In the city of Thneed-Ville surrounded by a wall, where all nature ceases to exist, and even the air is a commode, a commode with the
Since he was an openly practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would have been familiar with the story of a book where an unnamed young man learns that the local nature is being devastated by a count, tree-crushing industrialist Once-ler, who despite the protests of the title Lorax, a shrunken, knee-jerk.
Most likely, such a relatively small PR task was given to an assistant who never read Lorax to a child 20 times a piece.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text likely came from the office of Cameron's supporters.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by a Cameron employee, but without further comment.
Adam Lyth was in danger of neglecting England, but still holds
Competing with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after looking at the team that England selected for this tour, I think a repeat of the 3-0 defeat she suffered last season in the rehearsal series will not be very likely.
I wouldn't rule out winning guests either.
Alastair Cook’s party may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but there are good spin players in this tanning line-up and also the collective thinking is strong; they will not bear the 2012 scars, only the youthful positivity.
With the ball, Moeen Ali is a developing spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the test series level, represents an attacking possibility.
Adam Lyth dropped out of the England team in the season and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to leave Adam Lyth out is a tough one for me to analyze because his head coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests stood against two good attacks in challenging conditions and the simple, but hard reality is that cricket players are judged on performance.
For example, there were no questions about the name Joe Root, which led to the announcement, because — and I mentioned this earlier — players are their best pickers.
A few more half-century and Lyth could extend his series, but he was in control of his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he manages to get more runs for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
England’s head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his stance, even though his performance was not 100%, and I’m not surprised; he’s always been a team player.
The question of how much trial time the batter gets to show up is a hard nut.
Lyth was given seven hats — as was Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton was given nine.
Only Compton got a chance at home and out.
The only thing you could regret is that England first gave Jonathan Trott a chance in the Caribbean — even though Lyth was in his best form — but this wasted opportunity is already a thing of the past.
Alex Hales is coming, and that's the batsman that I rate very positively.
He's the x-factor cricketer we saw here in Yorkshire at the beginning of the season, when he won 236 against us at Trent Bridge, which he did a little bit.
It must be given at least the same opportunity as its predecessors, but of course all this will depend on the overall composition in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea when Moeen starts alongside Cook, who would get another extra spinner while retaining four quicks, was passed on and I have no reservations against her.
I don't understand why the strokemaker can't fire and this left-handed man has already shown he's an amazing cricketer.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his county, Worcestershire, but he was number 3 for them and there is no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer first played his first 38 rehearsals before his performance in 2001.
Three centuries passed and he didn’t even look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup spinner and when I had the opportunity to watch him, I was fascinated as a very impressive young man.
People can look at his rough statistics — an average of 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball — and I see that as a springboard, but there aren’t a lot of spinners who would raise their hands, and the selectors have opted for youth.
There is a lot to learn on this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have made a few changes and clever additions to their coaching staff.
Appointing Mahel Jayawardene, a Sri Lankan batsman, as a test match consultant can be a master move.
He is one of the most beautiful playing guys who will bring a rich experience by having experience with all conditions and all attacks.
Paul Collingwood arrives in the white-ball part of the tour and brings both energy and merciless spark to the team.
I have always felt that he was born directly into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or coach, and just like Mahela, he has an intellect that can be exploited.
New voices in the dressing room, even if they are voices saying consistent things that have been said before, can sometimes lighten and refresh the atmosphere.
Colly Durham teammate Ben Stokes got a day off, just like Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with this decision.
Although many disagree, coaches and coaches do not make a schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, that their work depends on the results.
Such decisions can never be taken lightly.
The Brexit campaign could win if the economy begins to stagnate by 2017.
David Cameron’s ill-conceived renegotiation strategy for keeping Britain in the EU gets into further trouble with every passing day even without choosing the brilliant Jeremy “Is it Yes or No?” Corbyn to lead the Workers’ Party, or the TUC will take the whole situation to the brink on Tuesday around Europe.
Foreigners also have their Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A close friend of the European diplomat recently explained how Europe is drowning in various crises - not all of which are their fault - some Member States already have enough British egocentric agendas, dividing concessions and disruptive treaty changes that they mostly did not want.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the TUC decided that they did not want to do so, even if they were to impose social protection.
We can even call it the selfie agenda of Dave and George.
The Prime Minister and Chancellor attend summits or bilateral meetings in foreign metropolises, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without local dignitaries, and then return home with the words that they are winning allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants an unseen Britain in Europe - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that some short-sighted ministers and officials in some major cities have come to a point where they don't care about our departure.
Angela Merkel, Germany’s cautiously balanced chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before it becomes bad for her, as was the case with too long-running Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power is also falling.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain on the left.
It’s hard to watch them break their legs with the help of the British Selfie, who could have invested their energy better to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK – something they themselves don’t want because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may deliberately plan useless SNP-style remarks during the campaign ahead of the 2017 UK referendum to speed up the Brexit process, a friend says.
"The renegotiation solved the problem" and "Britain has nothing of value from the negotiation."
Europeans, to their own detriment, know how predatory Fleet Street can be and how skeptical of the EU the press oligarch barons are because they were not during the 1975 Tony Benn-inspired referendum that supported our entry in 1973 in a 2:1 ratio.
They can vaguely remember the name of Boris Johnson, an eccentric Euro-opportunist who made his name as the Brussels-based "EU straight bananas" reporter in the early 1990s.
Despite his vanity, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a mix of tax-free crooks, foreigners hacking phones, and pseudo overseas departments that owned most of the big newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same about them, but he realized that when you're in a cage with an angry gorilla, you have to throw bananas at her so you don't have to have dinner and then tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron’s referendum routine, since Blair admitted to the principle of a repeal of the EU constitution, which was submerged by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and won him a discard card.
The press never forgave him either.
But dear Jeremy Corbyn, who kindly slapped me on the back in Westminster on Monday - I told him he mustn't waste any more time on me - seems to be in danger of re-adoption of Neil Kinnock's Murdoch boycott strategy, which was a mistake then and now.
It may take some time, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy of media engagement, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose chair he left at the BBC on Sunday.
Corbin's official attitude towards Europe is, I'll say it nicely, evolving.
He says he wants to remain in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside of Ukip’s rabid tendencies and the wild shores of Tory’s little Englanderism can certainly accede to it.
The same was said by Hilary "Bemm, but not Benniite" Benn on radio and television this week, when his inner scout could not decide to admit that Corbyn's appointment of the abrasive McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the '70s when his old father fought on television for his loyalty without going too far and losing his job.
Hillary's match was much more attractive.
But fighting to stay "in all circumstances" -- Benn's phrase -- was apparently not what McDonnell said, nor what JC said to colleagues and MPs at their private meeting on Monday night,
Whatever the sensitive image Corbyn wants to convey - don't forget, it touched me too - the discipline of the news remains important in the age of day-to-day television broadcasting and especially in the faith, the birthplace of the paranoia and betrayal that social media is all about.
It’s fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe that would allow him to take Labour’s support for the referendum campaign as self-evident, McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn’s basic distortion of EU membership – in line with their Bennite besieging economy, anti-capitalist past – is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom narcissism of small differences is the central essence of dogmatic scrutiny.
As with his twisting about NATO – Tom Watson is convinced that the JC campaign will not want to end it – foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand the meaning of all this for their home masters.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - because of Britain's concessions, when it seems unnecessary?
The United States is already quite disappointed by the Bris's "weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even while reducing the cost of the Conservative government in power, as I was reminded at the launch on Monday of something called the British-influenced Security Forum.
Experts criticize review of electronics published by Public Health England
The government-funded agency’s statement that e-cigarettes are 95% safer than smoking stemmed from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom have links to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet in criticizing the evidence used in its report on electronic cigarettes by the Public Health England (PHE) agency.
The PHE agency published a "memorandum" report last month and described it as a "comprehensive review of evidence."
However, several researchers questioned the breadth of the data and pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
The introductory article in the Lancet last month attacked the "extremely cumbersome base" on which PHE based its main findings.
Two other experts, writing for the BMJ, challenged the claim, which was allegedly "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, a professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said, "The basic principle of public health is that policy should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They say the public could expect PHE’s claim that “the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking” to be based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from a single meeting of 12 people called to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to synthesize their views on the harm associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the negotiations were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell say one sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO reportedly previously received funding from British American Tobacco for independent studies.
It also approved the public health mandate of the BAT in the sustainability report, it said.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting admitted funding from the e-cigarette manufacturer, but not funding he allegedly received earlier from tobacco company Philip Morris International, they say.
The reason for selecting the panel members is not available, but they contain several well-known champions of electronic cigarettes, some of whom also declare industrial financing in the newspaper.
Some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The meeting at PHE was also attended by tobacco management.
The report produced by this group "excusably admits," missing "hard evidence of the harmfulness of most products to most criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these links or restrictions are described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE’s claim that “there is no evidence yet that e-cigarettes act as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers,” was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said the BMJ claim had been answered earlier.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One in two life-long smokers dies from addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are comparatively small, but we need to continue to explore the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence shows and also what it does not show, especially when there has been so much public confusion about relative hazards compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from smoking-related illnesses, and smoking costs the NHS <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion per year.
By clearly highlighting the current evidence - that although e-cigarettes are not risk-free, they carry only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national competence.
BBC Should Quit EastEnders, Former Channel 4 Director Says
Former Channel 4 director Luke Johnson said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that his commercial rivals would "give a right hand" for a hit show like Albert Square.
Johnson said the license fee should only be used for programs that are not made up of other British television broadcasts.
He criticized the BBC for putting public service programs, which are likely to be watched by only a handful of people, into complex broadcast times compared to his rivals' biggest ratings show, and on channels like BBC4.
After CEO Tony Hall said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he had been unsuccessfully trying to connect with the BBC for the entire six years he worked on Channel 4.
"I'm struggling with the idea that the BBC is contracting and broadcasting programs that would certainly have been broadcast by rivals without the contributions of the state," Johnson told the House Communications Committee as part of the BBC's negotiations on the future.
If you keep license fees that I'm not sure are a good idea for the medium or long term, at least for programs that others don't produce or don't deliver, production should be reduced.
They broadcast The Voice in prime time because they want to get the widest possible support for the future.
The idea that no one else would broadcast it is a ridiculous joke, and of course meaningless.
Johnson said: “I don’t understand why a regressive tax should support programs that can be funded without contribution.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders another, and of course made on home soil.
Honestly, other channels would have given their right hand for them.
I can't understand how these are public broadcasting services.
I don't think it would weaken the BBC at all.
Johnson, a TV entrepreneur who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC that he felt guilty for chasing ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who worked here and because he believed it was the best way to secure long-term support."
His commentary on the BBC's most popular show repeats those of former Sky CEO Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest that the BBC sell the show as EastEnders.
Johnson said that even the more cosy BBC public service programs "move to BBC4, where quite often you can't measure the audience, but they are fulfilling their authority and can argue when they're going on their hypocritical mission to justify <0xC2><0xA3>4bn of royalty revenue."
They broadcast them at a time when no one is looking at them.
As for the licensing fee, Johnson told the commission, "I urge you to find a more regressive system about who gets the best value from it.
Of course, we all think that <0xC2><0xA3>150 a year is a big sum, but for people who <0xC2><0xA3>150 is a lot, I'd be surprised if they paid that much, because they don't watch the BBC that much.
Former director of Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who appeared before the commission on Tuesday, said the BBC should revise its Reithoven mission in the sense of "informing, educating and entertaining."
He confirmed that a small volume of BBC production was now previously classified as educational - it was 1% of television production and 0.1% on radio - and should take the role of a public broadcaster in Australia and Canada and change it to "inform, clarify and entertain."
Speaking about the partnership, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas like Proms, which only a handful were broadcast on television, and connect with commercial reporters so we can all see them online.
"Sonogenetics" or control of brain cells by sound waves
This video shows how sound impulses affect the direction in which the nodules move.
Scientists have raised worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can control sound waves.
Tiny nodules change direction when they are affected by sound impulses that are inaudible to the human ear.
Pulses work by switching cells of genetically modified motor neurons that are programmed to respond to these ultrasonic waves.
Related: Scientists Can Read and Write Brain Activity Using Light
The researchers said these worms are a great example of a new methodology called sonogenetics, which uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells and activates outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that this method could one day replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which electrodes that stimulate the brain are injected into the patient's brain.
The tubers usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that the reaction occurs when placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
As he found out, the bubbles amplify the ultrasound waves, which then pass through the body of the worms.
Enhanced ultrasound waves act in the ion channels of TRP-4, which are located in the membranes of some worm cells.
Thanks to sound waves, these channels open and activate the cells with which they are connected, according to a report in the journal Nature Communications.
In order to control the nodules using ultrasound waves, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons contain ion channels TRP-4.
When he then applied ultrasound to the modified worms, the sound waves were amplified by microbubbles and transferred to the worms, where they turned on the modified motor neurons.
The new method is in many ways similar to optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off using light.
However, Chalasani was told that sonogenetics could have many advantages over this technique.
Unlike light that has to be sent by optical fiber to the desired location in the brain, ultrasonic waves can penetrate tissue without restriction and be sent directly to the brain.
“We believe that by using gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasound signals used in clinical treatment to treat neurological diseases,” Chalasani said.
He added that the method would also find its application in the treatment of muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture equipment - right on your doorstep!
Ads embarrassing the British arms trade.
Watch the video on the anti-arms market from Amnesty International.
Horrible killer drones!
Foot shackles that break your ankles!
Destroying missiles!
And electric shading pads that cause unbearable pain, but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and caricature of the metaphors leave no one in doubt that this ad at the world's largest arms fairs is a sharp parody created for Amnesty International to highlight the British government's willingness to sell weapons to repressive regimes through defense and security equipment.
DSEI weapons trade fair: authoritarian regimes descend on London
But a separate campaign is also being led with posters popping up at bus stops and subways that require a second look.
"Important announcement, Traveling to the DLR from September 15 to 18?" reads one, using a font with the London Underground labels with DLR lines becomes the image of a tank.
This September, a roar of arms dealers will descend on the DLR... Customers are being asked to help stop the arms trade.
300 posters are created by artists who exhibit their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy Dismaland.
The collective called the Special Patrol Group has helped distribute it all over London and using “Ad Space Hack Packs,” which is <0xC2><0xA3>6 per piece of Allen’s key, which reportedly “gets access to about a third of the advertising space of bus stops on the planet.”
Transport for London is not entertained by this vandalism.
One of the advertising parodies produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and an expert assistant at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and trying to show political activity to spectators outside the gallery.
Many artists move on to work with activists within protest movements and realize that they need to get out in the real world to have their art impact on society.
Another of the posters against the trade in health weapons passengers in the subway.
Amnesty’s video was viewed by more than 100,000 people on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by the VCCP agency working free of charge, and the graphic designer and commentator also worked for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever would be surprised by the silence surrounding the arms trade ads - he saw an empty spot on the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "Let's show them a campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with creating more realistic risky corporate ads, but “by adding colorful colors and animations, I’ve made it attract more people.”
“They did a fantastic piece of work and helped us raise concerns about the sale of illegal torture instruments at the fair,” said Tom Davies of Amnesty International.
What we need now is for the UK government to take action and ensure that the torture facility is not illegally traded on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms store comes from inside ExCeLu, where exhibitors sell fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order from the U.S. military for "the AT4CS RS firing arm."
This includes “a uniquely shaped head that delivers amazing effects beyond armor inside the target.”
Whatever it is, it won't be pleasant.
8 golden rules for living in college
11 years ago, I moved to college as an inattentive 19-year-old boy, still a believer in barts and moral relativism, but only now do I forget the tense smiles of those I was bothering — and numerous, lengthy complaints about others.
Everything I’ve learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving on the rails can range from mild on the nerves of the walking to totally shocking.
It's tempting to gossip: to tell people where you're from, if you've taken a year off, what you think of Corbyn and why "you honestly don't love or hate Marmite, because people, it's just an extract of HAHA yeasts, I'll be with you in peace."
Take a deep breath.
And help others to breathe too - ask and express interest.
It manages the conversation and helps you find people you love and those you wouldn't have fun with even if your eyelashes were in one fire and they were releasing fire extinguishers.
Leave room for people.
People’s rooms often change into drinking receptions, movie venues, and public spaces, but they’re also rooms where people dress and tweak their underwear.

Introverts will come to college.
Your room should be a haven, yet a lot of tracks are turning into an off-the-shelf walking culture that is friendly, sociable and contributes to lifelong friendships.
It can be hell for someone who needs to be charged.
No culture allows you to say, “I love you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to leave so that I can return to the energy I used to interview you.”
Try to find out when a classmate is tired of socializing — and maybe write him a tap instead.
Speaking of tapping: tapping.
One of the guys in my tracks used to say that if the door isn't locked, he's invited in.
He saw a few things.
Make friends through baking.
Since you started going to university at the top of a baking mania, knocking on a stranger's door and performing with a sheet of baked cakes seems a little less strange, less than "Welcome to the neighborhood, I've baked you something, now smile while I'm going to ask you personal questions."
Offering home entertainment is a good way to find friends.
Your roommates will feel obliged to talk to you and maybe it will all end up with your face being assigned to a tasty surprise.
This, of course, is the subject of being a decent baker.
Poorly condensed pieces of flour, sugar, and starch are likely to prevent others from pretending to sleep when you try to knock on their door.
Stealing food is a common crime on college campuses.
Stealing a whole chicken is, of course, a crime, but is a drop of milk in your tea theft?
Check with the owner of the milk twice.
There is a chance that they will offer you milk even if they get angry inside.
If someone steals something from you, it’s annoying and you have my sympathy – but try to deal with it a little more adult than my roommate, who traded her milk for a dishwashing agent to punish the thief.
He's in jail now.
You should not make sounds that disturb people from sleeping or studying.
It’s not just about being a decent human being, but you’re also famous people in glass houses.
A girl from my hallway asked her neighbors if they could shut up a little drum and bass because it was 3 in the night and in the morning she had a note.
Their answer was to amplify the music.
When they were finally quiet at 5 a.m., she let them sleep quietly for two hours and then she played her own music out loud, locked the door and left for her three-hour song.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future son went to the same colleges as you?
On the contrary, wouldn’t it be terribly embarrassing if you mistook your roommates for your future home, slept together, broke up, and had to see each other every day, and maybe take control of your mutual friends as well?
Of course, you don’t guarantee your heart – but if your sexy roommate is not your future ally, at least try to talk to your weaknesses a little bit.
In the exhilarating moment when you realize that someone has left the keys in their unlocked room, there is only a thin line between fun and bullying.
A good joke is funny, but it's easy to fix.
Teach them a valuable and fun lesson about their safety by hiding something from them - never mess someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and put the keys in the water bottle, which you then put in the freezer – but never put their stuff on the ceiling more than twice.
Eva was looking forward to the twins despite the uncertain prospects for the future.
Eva had a rough time already during her pregnancy with today’s seven-year-old V<0xC3><0xAD>tka.
His father divorced her, and she was alone to prepare and raise her offspring.
I dealt with the situation fairly quickly - I was very much looking forward to the baby and I was looking for positives in it.
Uncertainty and being alone with the child, I tried not to bother.
And I certainly had the hope in myself that we would not be alone for a long time, remembers Eva today of her first pregnancy.
Already then she met on the Internet at the chat of the older Va<0xC5><0xA1>ka, with whom they began to talk about their favorite films.
Va<0xC5><0xA1>ek even brought Eve with V<0xC3><0xAD>tek home from the obstetrics, but he did not play the role of his stepfather.
"He then pulled out of the program for a while," Eva described in the documentary series Four in Three.
The reason for the third series of the Czech television series is precisely the search for happiness on the second attempt.
She took care of V<0xC3><0xAD>tka and the financial security of the family thanks to part-time work and great help from her mother and aunt.
Even the prospects of responsibility for a foreign child ultimately did not undermine Vaska’s affection for Eve.
They definitely got together around V<0xC3><0xAD>tkov<0xC3><0xBD>’s second birthday and he now understands V<0xC3><0xAD>tkov<0xC3><0xBD> as his father and also addresses him.
Although Va<0xC5><0xA1>ek already has two adult daughters, at the age of sixty he enjoys fatherhood according to his words and is also more devoted to children.
In addition to V<0xC3><0xAD>tek, two-year-old Leont<0xC3><0xBD>nka and eventually twins joined them.
"Yours entered our family in a natural way, perhaps even because my mother never talked to me much in relationships," smiles Eva.
Not enough room?
At least we're close.
The twins Emma and Ela were born by caesarean section after Eva was diagnosed with pregnancy cholestasis at the end of her pregnancy.
This is a disorder of the production and activity of bile acids, which then occur in excessive amounts in the blood of a pregnant woman and are manifested in particular by itching.
The disease is dangerous for the unborn fetus, which is at risk of premature birth and death, in the mother after childbirth usually spontaneously relapses.
Emma and Ela were born healthy to Eve and Wask's happiness, even though they were only in their 36th week.
Emika was placed in an incubator in the intermediate department, where Vaskov’s niece also works, who managed to take over and accommodate her.
Elinka was bigger and immediately after transfer from JIP to the room I had her with me, she describes the difficult period after the birth of Eva.
She spent twenty days in the obstetrics until the doctors agreed to release the babies, who meanwhile managed to reach the two-pound limit.
Waiting for the baby to be picked up at Eve’s maternity hospital was not a joy, however.
"I was insane about my husband and kids," recalls a four-year-old mother who had been struggling at the six-part separation.
She and her husband also considered signing the reverse, among other things because of the insensitive approach of one of the doctors.
However, this did not happen and the doctors released Eva and her twins into home care.
The stories of four pregnancies and births are broadcast by <0xC4><0x8C>T1 on Tuesday evening at 21:45.
A large number of families are able to reduce themselves.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva had to settle for an electric double boiler and tight conditions.
The house did not grow, but Va<0xC5><0xA1>ek made Eva happy by installing a gas cooker to make the preparation of meals for six people more comfortable.
If it's too late, we'll switch to a taxi.
Eva is convinced that the children especially perceive the family well-being and pleasant atmosphere, and not the size or fluffiness of the house.
So far, we've done a lot better than we expected.
Although the disorder hides worse in a small space and we sometimes cross the baby's curls, but at least we are all close, smiles Eva, who can find a positive side in every situation.
The work of the wax lamp on the film is not a guarantee of regular income.
That’s why he occasionally goes to the streets of Prague as a taxi driver.
At the age of 60, according to his words, the care of the family and children physically manages it, but how long will it be?
"I realize that, given our age difference, it will be me one day who will feed this family," Eva said in a statement.
She would like to return to work, but is even more attracted to the possibility of her own business.
With four kids, I'm not exactly a suit for an employer.
And when it gets worse, my husband and I can switch to a taxi, a nice blonde jokes.
Apple has a no-nonsense effect.
Displays can do anything.
A more powerful processor, a higher-resolution camera, a firmer chassis or a touch-recognizable display are, in short, the advantages of the recently introduced ninth-generation iPhones.
The latter two also have a negative impact on the dimensions and weight of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.
Apple’s current trend has been that each new generation of iPhones is lighter than the previous generation.
The exceptions were only the third and fourth generation, whose weight slightly increased compared to previous iPhones.
The two-gram weight difference in the disadvantages of this news was really negligible.
However, this is far from the case with the new iPhones.
Compared to last year's iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, the weight increased by 14 grams for a smaller model, and by 20 grams for a larger model.
On the one hand, it is not surprising that last year's affair of bending in Apple's pockets was greatly afflicted.
The chassis of the novelty is made of a more durable aluminum alloy 7000, which is also projected on the weight.
But the screens have a much greater impact on it.
Apple has used 3D Touch technology to distinguish the power of touch on the screen.
To do this, it was necessary to equip the display with another layer of capacitive sensors.
The weight of the screens of the new iPhones has more than doubled compared to previous generations.
For a smaller iPhone from 12 grams to 29 grams, for a larger one from 19 to 40 grams.
For the iPhone 6s, the display is the most difficult component to use.
The weight of just 143 grams is also achieved with this novelty thanks to the thickening crust, which touched most of the remaining components.
For a larger model, it is then the most heavily used element of the battery, but its weight has not changed compared to its predecessor.
Even in this case, the biggest increase is visible in the display.
The weight of the 5.5" iPhone 6s Plus thus reaches 192 grams.
As practical as the new display technology will be, it will only show up when used.
First users will be able to try it as early as Friday, September 25, when the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus will be launched in selected countries.
Have champion breakfast flakes been around for tens of thousands of years?
In the Italian Grotta Paglicci, archaeologists have succeeded in finding a site that opens up interesting possibilities.
They discovered traces of settlement by modern man from different times, including murals, remains of tools and so on and so forth.
In layer 23A, which according to the instruments is dated to about 30,000 years ago, but scientists have discovered something very reminiscent of the remains of the breakfast buffet.
In fact, traces of oatmeal were found on the site, which apparently went through the process of producing today so popular flakes.
At it, the grains are first soaked today, then dried, rid of the packaging, the so-called plow, then roasted and squeezed flat.
In the cave Paglicci, grains were found, which were apparently heated or burned, and then apparently crushed between two millstones - at least traces of use on two stones in the cave indicate.
Scientists have not been able to prove in their publication for the journal PNAS that a complete process of production of flakes would take place in the cave, but the similarity is indeed very striking.
We also don’t have any evidence of how people could eat flakes, but the assumption that it was with some liquid and quite possibly even warm, of course, offers itself quite logically.
At the same time, it is a very interesting proof of how intensively people used cereals long before agriculture was founded.
If the flake interpretation is correct, the oldest flakes have preceded agriculture by about 20,000 years.
New reports of stations in the Transport Company of the City of Brno.
So once again I listened to the report of the names of stops in the trolleybus: Hnus<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>kova, Ghost, Frazov<0xC3><0xA1>, Sprateck<0xC3><0xA1>.
Of course, the trolleybus was a little louder, so the male voice was a little less understandable than before, when the stops were reported by the female voice.
The female voice is higher, so in the deeper traffic noise is better discernible than the deeper male voice.
DPMB argues that this speaker was chosen by the passengers themselves - I don't know who, nobody asked me, but they certainly chose it from studio recordings taken in complete silence, which of course sounded quite different from the frame of the bus engine.
I have been living in Brno for a few decades, so I know the correct names of all the stops from my memory, so I do not need this report, but foreigners from elsewhere who do not know about Brno and for whom these reports are not primarily intended, can be hardened, they can be confused, they can finally find out where
Perhaps the choice of the loudspeaker - but better again the loudspeakers - should be made again, and this time under-colored by the usual traffic noise and engine noise, in which the buzzing of the loudspeaker in the bus is almost lost.
So that we no longer have to listen to the names of the stations of Vodn<0xC3><0xAD> Her<0xC5><0xA1>pice, <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC3><0xAD>rov<0xC3><0xA1>, or Ponorn<0xC3><0xA1> in the creepy joke that I moved to in Kom<0xC3><0xA1>rov.
I guess my old age hearing didn't get so bad all at once during that one day when the stop speaker changed.
Before that day, I understood those reports quite well.
Good morning, Comrade Chief.
From the tracker's notes.
Today, few people know what were the biggest and smartest so-called “complex checks” during the party’s governments.
I've allowed myself to remember that.
The bus was late.
I ran into the dispatcher's office the minute the radio sounded that it was seven o'clock.
"You're lucky you didn't collide with the comrade-in-chief, he came a minute ahead of you, and he seems to be in a bad mood," the dispatcher remarked as I entered the book of arrivals.
Thank you, I'll be careful.
Write me that I'm going to the districts for a little mechanization review.
That's not going to work, there are checks today.
Everybody's fucked up, it's horrible.
What's the matter?
'You'll see, 'said the dispatcher.
Next time, you'll be too.
I ran into the hallway.
Immediately the door of the headquarters opened, and the chief appeared.
Tightened, with a stone face, in a perfectly fit uniform.
'Good morning, Chief, 'I said respectfully, and quickly put two buttons on my jacket in the same way.
'Good morning, 'said the answer, and I rushed to the second floor without realizing the cold, sinister tone the old man answered.
'You're playing, 'said the engineer, Eva, an old lady whom I greatly appreciated.
She said she was the boss before her comrades put her down.
There are checks, and you'll be here soon.
How many times have I asked what these complex checks are, but no one wants to talk much about it.
They say they happen once every three years, they all have to go to them, and it's quite unpleasant.
At least for some.
I'll see, though.
I pulled out a folder with periodic reports and a phone.
'This is Holcman, come to me now, 'said the chief's voice.
What's bothering you?
Now we've met and nothing..." I mumbled, but no one answered me, everyone just with their thoughts.
"Good morning, comrade chief, I have come to your order," I said, rejoining myself, barely entering the chief's office.
The chief was sitting at the desk, looking at a file.
"Comrade mechanic," he said after a moment, without raising his head and still looking carefully at the record, "I don't like your behavior at all."
He threw the ladder on the table, leaned against the back of the chair, and stared at me with a familiar, unpleasant, evil, picky look.
I'm lost.
What's going on?
Yesterday, the Vice-Chancellor praised the fact that I worked very well during the few months in office and that he is extremely satisfied with me.
That the chief did very well when he pulled me out of the squad at a distance.
And now this?
Realize that you're a track-distance technician, and that's what you have to do.
The kind of greeting you used this morning is simply unacceptable.
I said that I have used such greetings since I was a child, that I was raised so much and that I see nothing wrong with it.
To the chief, it was like a red turkey cloth.
"You're on a socialist railroad, and the only acceptable greeting is the honor of the job," he said.
And besides, you're still tampering with your superiors' addresses.
One time you say "sir" and another time you say "comrade".
But I'm not a master chief for you, I'm a comrade chief.
The comrades are comrades are comrades are comrades are comrades are comrades are comrades are comrades are comrades!
Please, remember that!
Excuse me, Mr.... Comrade Chief, but... but I greeted you with a regular civic greeting.
There's nothing wrong with that... and it's an honor job, or comrade... you know... I'm not on the side...
"It's not your preference that you're not on the side," said the chief, who had calmed down a bit in the meantime.
There will still be talk about it.
Anyway, remember, you don't have a prepaid pension in that chair upstairs.
That wasn't good.
When the chief told someone something wasn't his preference, it didn't look good to the person in question.
For a moment he pierced me with a cold, picky look, and I was looking for words to answer.
I was also annoyed by his elevated ticking.
He was only a few years older, and he was playing god, actually, comrade god.
Jealous, inflated, authoritarian, arrogant, as he sees fit at the moment.
They all sneered at him.
Well, he's the chief.
In fact, not everyone, the chairman of the party organization, like all party members, but also non-party members, tyked him.
But the chief tyrannized many, especially those for whom he could exercise his superiority.
Right now, he's shoving me for complete bullshit.
I thought something about my ass and it cost me enough persuasion not to shoot it in his face.
But I wouldn't even go back to being a croupier, let alone a railroad official.
What would I eat for two kids?
And then there's the built-in barracks!
I was in a hurry, but I was in control.
I won't make him happy.
"That's all you can do for now," said the chief, and began to look again at the record he had in his hand.
I was summoned at 12:30.
Everyone in the office was there, and when asked what and how, they said yes, it would be good.
Only Jo<0xC5><0xBE>in said, as was his custom, that they could not expel us all, because the comrade-in-chief would have to do the work himself with his faithful, and that he would not be in danger.
The word "comrade" he emphasized, as if he knew what the old man had wiped me for in the morning.
There was a nice meeting in the principal's office.
Comrade Chief, at his desk and at the long counseling table, other comrades who were to decide on my official being or not being.
Squadronman, ROH chairman, staff registrar, special purpose referee, sort of a military counterattack, and deputy, my boss.
And also the person most important, the chairman of the party organization.
I knew him by heart.
An ordinary railway worker, who beats a barbed wire or throws gravel with forks.
He was also a former guard.
It was rumored that there was no fun with him at the time, a pretty beast.
Bad languages claimed that he left school in seventh grade, did not learn anything, did not know anything.
And when the crime was canceled, he ended up in a squat with a potato potato.
But comrade, yes, comrade was forged!
The chief told me to sit down.
There was a little soul in me, an inseparable lump in my neck.
The officer read the opinion of the civil committee from the place of residence.
I come from a working-class family, I'm married, I have two children and so on and so on.
So far it's good, I thought, and I was breathing a little better.
Then the opinion from the street organization of the party.
He copied the opinion from the Civilian Committee, maybe both of them were written by the same person.
But then it came!
The parents, a longtime member of the party, refused to appear before the inspection committee and subsequently resigned from the party, allegedly for health reasons.
The chief looked at me sharply.
The clerk noticed this and stopped reading.
The chief told him to go on.
It just got worse.
I was a member of the city council of SSM and there I was obtained as a candidate of the party.
Regardless of the parents who left the party, the party gave me confidence.
But I got married and I had a wedding in addition to the national committee in the church.
I have disappointed the party in the worst possible way.
That's why I was expelled from her list of candidates.
But that wasn't enough!
I baptized both children, and even my mother, when she died, I attended a church funeral, even though she was a former member of the party.
All this shows a negative attitude towards the leading role of the party.
When the clerk read it, only the tapping of the chief's pencil on the tabletop interrupted the tense silence.
Everyone was staring at me, and I wish I was somewhere far away.
I kept repeating in my mind "Communists - superhumans, communists - superhumans." What did I get into?
Why didn't I stay with the blacksmiths?
I was able to fix the shifts without any fucking checks.
But now?
She took the career of a railroad official for her before she started.
Back in the squad?
I don't think that's going to work. I'm sure the chief will take me out for an hour.
"Comrade, how did you examine the comrade in question here?" interrupted the chief in a tense silence with a question to the cadet.
Well, according to a review from a previous job.
Do you have it here?
It was obviously not over twice for the squadron.
On the shortness of his breath, he muttered nervously, as if he had been examined himself.
He nodded eagerly and handed some paper to the chief.
"Well," said the chief, with a hint of zeal, which was often a harbinger of the storm.
At first glance, the praise itself, trained with distinction, graduated an industrialist, worked in the task pay as a locksmith, fulfilled the norm on average by one hundred and twenty percent.
But the important thing is missing.
Where did you get that opinion from, comrade?" he turned again to the clerk, who felt that it was somehow starting to turn against him and that he might not even have to be a clerk very soon.
This is where my comrade gave it to me when he stepped in.
Is that enough for you?
"Well, when he came to us, he went to the district in a squad," said the midget.
And there's no testimony required, his was kind of extra, so I put it in his file.
"So when you put this piece of paper into the technical function, it was enough for you," said the chief dryly.
The guard grinned nervously, and there was no answer.
"No problem, we'll talk about it later," the chief concluded, and the warden was obviously relieved.
It's stable for now.
"So what about you, comrade?" the chief turned to me again.
All of a sudden, it's over!
It was dark in my eyes, it was hot.
There was an influx of reprimands and accusations, and I knew I was the most disgusting creature in the world that deserved no mercy.
That by underlining the incomplete opinion, I misled the colleague of the cadet rapporteur, not understanding why the opinion was incomplete when I got it from the cadet in the factory.
I am also an anti-socialist element which, at the time of building real socialism, supports the breeding of religious obscurity and even participates in it.
That, yes, there were a lot of things I've done, or maybe I'm still doing, and I've been praying quietly for it to end.
It didn't matter to me.
I didn't care if I flew out of the mechanizer's place.
I didn't care if they took my potato.
This is work for honest and decent people, not for the enemy of the people, as I was in the eyes of the comrade-in-chief.
"That would be enough, comrade-in-chief," the leader of the party suddenly said, interrupting the chief's levitates sharply.
The comrade here made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What a mistake, just stupidity he made!
He has already received his punishment.
Don't forget that, Comrade Chief!
What could be worse for a young man than to close the door to his side for a while!
In order to open up to him again, he will have to prove that he has changed, that he is worthy of our trust again.
The uneducated guard spoke like a book.
Where did it come from?
Is that how the phrases from party trainings and meetings were summed up or parroted?
That is why this young comrade must also get a chance from us!
A chance to prove he's changed.
And who is to give it to him, if not you, comrade chief?
It is your duty to support this young, true, somewhat erroneous comrade in his efforts for correction!
It's your party duty that no one can take away from you!
In fact, it is a party duty for all of us.
Here the comrade must see that the side has not forgotten him.
As a kind mother, she not only punishes, but also loves.
When the president was finished, no one even looked.
No one expected such a turn of events.
At least I did.
"I totally agree with you, Comrade President," the chief glazed in an attempt to take the initiative again.
If you'd let me talk, you'd hear that's exactly what I was going to come to.
They all shook their heads in agreement, but they could see that they did not believe him at all.
"So I was confirmed for the role of independent referee of care of basic resources," I sighed as I returned to the office and soon cried.
Thankfully, except for Eva's engineer, they were all at lunch.
That silence listened to my inconsequential portrayal of fresh experiences, and I calmed down in the meantime.
When I finished, she asked if I could have a coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, she put water on the stove and prepared the mugs.
In the meantime, she was talking about nursery practices.
As one judgment, often full of praise, they put a man in his hand, and the other, in which there is some filth, they send it to a new employer.
But I didn't end up where I was supposed to be, but at the potato grinder, so the comrades at the factory didn't know where to send it.
What about our babysitter?
He only cares where he eats or drinks, and that's how it ended.
"He'll catch it from the old man," she remarked maliciously.
I'm sure he won't like it today.
Be careful of him anyway, he's pretty vengeful.
And the party president?
In fact, a much worse chief, none of the crowded.
Zero of a potato with a lot of power.
The coffee water began to boil, and soon the office filled with the smell of just poured coffee.
I threw a sugar cube into a cup and quietly mixed the hot potion.
I guess I'm from the worst out there.
Now they won't fire me, and there's only three more years to go.
Anyway, comrade chief, he's not gonna forget about me today.

The symbol of the community revived.
The wheel of the windmill above Chlum is turning again after years.
It is visible from a distance because it is located on a fifteen-meter-high pole.
People from all over the world call it "The Wind at Chlum."
For the village of 150 inhabitants, it even became one of the elements of the municipal symbol, which the village acquired for the occasion of the meeting of the natives in 2010.
"We asked for a sign at the time and we wanted to have a fan on the sign of course, everyone knows it in the area," said Mayor Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Ma<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
The Chlum wind pump is a local technical monument.
It is also a memento of the present: it recalls the time when the locals fought for quality drinking water.
The one in Chlum in the past centuries was a rarity.
It was not until 1910 that the Chlum representatives decided on a solution that was then suitable until the mid-1980s.
In the village near the branch on <0xC4><0x8C><0xC3><0xAD>chov they dug a well seven meters deep.
Three years later, the well was supplemented by a metal structure with a wind pump, which pumped water into a reservoir at the highest point of the village, near the local church.
"The construction was carried out by Anton<0xC3><0xAD>n Kunc from Hranice in Moravia at a cost of 2,400 CZK," says a commemorative inscription on the ground-floor fence of the construction of the pillar.
The pump after several repairs and falls of the wind wheel served in 1971.
On May 7, 1973, a new chapter of the fight for water began to be written: on that day, a new water supply line began to serve in Chlum.
The wind pump has remained only a non-functional municipal symbol and a rarity.
The dominant was commissioned at this year's meeting of natives.
It was not until 2008 that the Chlums decided to repair the windmill again and put it back into operation.
They left to make a replica of the original wheel - reduced by an average of half a meter.
The wheel was mounted on a pole, but had to be brought down in the same year.
The manufacturer of the replica did not choose the right material and the wheel could not withstand the gusts of wind.
Then the Chlum dominatrix rested for several years undressed under the roof.
However, since June this year, the wheel on the high post is turning again.
On the occasion of the meeting of the natives, the village had the replica of the wheel modified and again placed it on the top of the iron tower.
But the wheel draws usable water from the well only into the assault blind arm.
And over the summer, we completely disconnected it because there was little water in the well.
At least it was going to be empty.
"Then in the autumn we release the shafts of the wind wheel from the pump in the suction cup again," explained Mayor Ma<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
Chlum is not the only village in the Czech Republic where the windmill has been given the communal mark, but it is the only village of this type in the whole Highlands.
They have a similar element in the sign in honor of local technical monuments, for example in Chvalkovice and Zelen<0xC3><0xA1> Hora in Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kovska, in Ku<0xC5><0xBE>elov in Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>nsk, in Partutovice in P<0xC5><0x99>erovsk or in Polica in Vset<0xC3><0xAD>nsk.
Nothing wrong, but I don't know Lafatu, admitted the support of Tripoli Goian.
"I remember the fight against Slavia very well, and my goal, like everyone in my career," the 34-year-old smiled at the pre-match press conference.
Georgie Hagi coached us at the time, it was unfortunate that we lost.
I hope to score a goal for Sparta now.
Only with the difference that we won't lose this time," Goian continued.
This man, who played 60 games for the Romanian national team, is a key supporter of the Greek team.
As a stopper, he will face the assaults of the Spartan offensive.
A few thousand people will come, no hell, says the Spartan Hyb<0xC5><0xA1> about the Greek fight.
He knows what to expect on Thursday night.
I know Fatai well, who played in the Romanian Astra with my brother Lucian.
At that time I saw all their matches.
"I know he's a very good striker, so he went to Sparta too," Goian said.
He did not name any other players of the Prague club, so the direct question arose as to whether he also knew David Lafat, the best shooter in the history of the Czech league and captain Sparta.
Goian smiled and, with a slightly reprehensible look, aimed at Czech journalists.
A helpless expression in the face meant, "Why are you asking me that?"
After a moment of silence, he let go.
We saw some videos and I noticed that Sparta plays a lot as a team.
He has really good players.
And Lafata?
Nothing wrong, but I don't know anyone but Fatai.
The Spartans know this very well about Goian.
"He has experience from larger clubs, we can say that he holds the defense of Asteras, he is their organizer of the game," said Stanislav Hejkal, a Spartan assistant.
Goian has the best years yet, but he can boast a very interesting football resume.
At the time, Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both Manchester United and City were interested in him, but from Steauy he headed to the Italian Palermo, also playing for the Glasgow Rangers.
We expect an aggressive and unusual style, says the coach.
Sparta is a big team, regularly plays European Cups, is fighting for victory in the Czech league.
"For me, he's my favourite in this game, but we play at home and we want to start the group with a good result.
"Like Sparta, we will try to win," Goian said.
I am in a room with Slovak goalkeeper Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Ko<0xC5><0xA1>ick<0xC3><0xBD>, who is looking forward to competing from the Czech Republic.
Me, too.
But for the whole team, I can say we're going to fight hard.
Kofola is moving from Poland to the Czech Republic, considering entering the Prague Stock Exchange.
The new headquarters should have Kofola in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland for trading the company’s shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary goal is to have the group’s headquarters in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have taken so far as part of the project are mainly legal and administrative and do not have an actual impact on the events in the company, says Daniel Bury<0xC5><0xA1>, CFO of the Kofola Group.
"In connection with the relocation of the group's headquarters, shareholders are considering the placement of shares on the Prague Stock Exchange."
Due to the entry on the Prague Stock Exchange, the company is completing a securities prospectus, which it will submit to the Czech National Bank for approval in the near future.
The transfer of the headquarters of the holding company and the related transfers of shares will be carried out in the form of a non-public transaction, with only existing shareholders participating in it.
As a result, no shares will be offered to the public or new investors.
“An eventual offer of shares to new investors would take place – if the company and its shareholders so decide – later, either in the 4th quarter of 2015 or in the 1st quarter of 2016,” the company said.
The company has already stated in the past that a possible offer of shares could consist of the issuance of new shares or the sale of existing shares.
This offer could consist of an offer of shares on the stock exchange in the Czech Republic and Poland, including the placement of shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Test of objectivity of Czech Television in informing about the migrant crisis.
Another small test of the objectivity and balance of the news of the main Czech media about the refugee crisis.
This time, the Czech Television's main news broadcasting session.
And how did she survive?
When they teach journalism at the Faculty of Journalism about how the media can manipulate reality, they can play today's broadcast of the Czech Television Events.
About 80% of the news coverage was devoted to the migrant crisis.
Only the first minute, when <0xC4><0x8C>T reported on the unrest on the Serbian-Hungarian border and euphemistically called the attacks of migrants on the police, did they lose patience - they threw stones and attacked with metal bars), the current pro-migrant propaganda was already underway - judge the names of the individual reports.
Criticism of NGOs - a large space for non-profit organizations that criticize mistreatment of migrants.
Syrian Children in the Czech School - a story of integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Refugees are not only a threat, but also an opportunity.
Migration of refugees - The Czech Republic consistently uses the terms refugee or refugee and not migrant.
Surprisingly, in illustrative shots, <0xC4><0x8C>T consistently uses only and only shots for young children and women.
In the same broadcast, she said that of the migrants detained in the Czech Republic, 80% are men.
Summary: For the most part, propaganda that is unparalleled by communist agitators.
I have to say, as a former journalist, I am ashamed of my colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
When I once went up to a flat, I soon ceased to be the only inhabitant.
My fish had moved to the lavatory.
Domesticated fish, insects with imperfect transformation, i.e., non-transforming that transformation from caterpillar to beetle, and to the young it looks like an adult individual, only it is small and gradually grows.
They were disgusting to me and I didn't want to kill them.
First by hand and then chemically.
The socialist drugstore provided some blue crystals for their disposal.
I think it was called Cyclone B.
Or some other way?
However, it has successfully eliminated them.
Later, I dealt with the pharaohs in a similar way.
A box with some kind of juvenalizer that the ants brought to the nest and he then did not allow the queen to generate new offspring.
But I turned it off.
As time went on, insects became the object of my admiration, and I became more and more inclined to believe that they had the same right to life as we humans.
In addition, I have learned from my life that intervention in the ecosystem does not lead to success and can replace one pest with another.
The truth about fleas and bugs, I wouldn't want to spoil my karma by killing them.
In our new home, my partner and I agreed that if the fish don’t go up our throats, they should eat their skins, their invisible eyelashes, and so on.
Their serene existence was disrupted by a spider over time.
It was a common kind of corner that had been sitting on the ceiling for a long time.
We thought he was living from occasional flies and mosquitoes, which only increased our comfort.
Since he lived with us for several years, we found that he mainly feeds on fish and that his numbers were probably kept at a bearable counting state.
Through intimate regular contact with each of our needs, we found out that she was a female.
After all, we witnessed romantic enticements with a partner about a third smaller, as carefully snoring on the fibers of the web, so that he would not be eaten before he reached the desired domination.
It took about three days when they didn’t move and didn’t respond to our controls.
Under the toilet bowl, where the love games were played, we later found the remains of a dried male next to the female.
Then the spider didn't move for weeks.
When we thought it was over, we were surprised by the number of little spiders hanging around her.
They soon disappeared.
Some of them were eaten by their mothers, some of them were eaten elsewhere.
Even the female disappeared somewhere after a week.
We don't know if she left or died, but after a month or two, she appeared again on the ceiling.
True, a little smaller, probably the daughter of that former toilet inhabitant.
For some time, she watched our behavior carefully from the ceiling, and by moving under the toilet bowl, she evaluated our non-attack as friendship.
The number of slightly multiplied fishes decreased again, and the spider calmly watched over its normal activities to provide food.
Our ecosystem hasn’t changed in a year.
Our daughter, meanwhile, has reached the age when using a bedclothes was already an embarrassment.
We have tolerated it so far, but the eternal pouring of its contents has already devoured us.
We encouraged her more and more to use the toilet.
But the daughter found an excuse to keep her bad habit in the spider she could see very well on when she wiped it.
Our talk about seeing a spider didn't take happiness in the house at all.
Crying and screaming, she forced her towel.
There wasn't any.
There was a time when the spider, in the interest of the developmental shift of the daughter, had to command.
It's up to me.
He was caught in a glass and thrown over a balcony somewhere in the garden.
I said goodbye to him as a friend, but after such a long coexistence, I still felt disgusted as if I were expelling a relative.
We assumed that the fish would begin to appear more often and begin to multiply by a geometric row.
Wonder World, a week, two, none of us showed up.
I began to speculate about the cause.
I was wondering if the ants-like spider didn't somehow grow in there, that the toilet environment wasn't as conducive to their existence as we thought.
But then the first pieces of medium size appeared, and they were already moaning again.
I had to come up with a different theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I found that their attachment to the spider must have had a cause in that when they don't see it, it's hidden somewhere else and they're in danger from anywhere.
Or, perhaps they had some telepathic connection to their predator, and his rapid disappearance in them provoked some alarming reaction.
Especially since I have no illusions about their eyes.
They showed some light shyness, but that they would respond to hand-whipping or quick movements, it is not.
My daughter goes to the bathroom regularly.
I think she's forgotten about the towel.
All we have to do is attract some spiders again.
I'm already sending my wishes to the air, and I hope they didn't let me down after that execution.
Otherwise, we'd have to use Cyclone B.
The Ten Sayings of Albert Einstein that enriched the world.
The sayings of a brilliant scientist from the last century seem to never cease to fascinate mankind.
He was able to immerse himself in everything so deeply that the result was always an astonishing discovery.
Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was one of the most important scientists of all time.
In particular, he introduced his special and general theory of relativity, which so far best describes the universe in its gigantic ratio.
It can also not be neglected to clarify the photoeffect or the idea of the quantization of the electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the very description and system of knowledge of the popular theory of relativity is for many so intricate that for closer acquaintances they prefer to choose simple proportions.
However, it is not easy.
However, it would not have been Albert Einstein if he had not found a brilliantly simplified form of explanation for this: a clock near your sweetheart seems to be a minute; a minute in a hot oven seems to be an hour – and that is relativity.
I have allowed myself to choose from his entire pleiad of famous quotes these ten that literally enthralled me.
Intelligent people try to solve problems, geniuses try not to do them.
Only two things are infinite.
The universe and human stupidity.
I'm not so sure about the first one.
No amount of experimentation can ever prove that I was right.
The only one who can prove me wrong at any time.
But it is a sad time when it is easier to break the atom than to destroy prejudice.
If the disorder on the table is a reflection of the disorder in the mind, what then reflects the empty table?
I don't know what they're going to fight in World War III, but in World War IV, it's gonna be sticks and stones.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but no way to resurrect it.
To know little is dangerous, and to know much is also dangerous.
If I had an hour to deal with the problem that my life depends on, I would spend 40 minutes studying it, 15 minutes analyzing it, and 5 minutes solving it.
The hardest thing in the world to understand is income tax.
In conclusion, I cannot forgive myself for not putting Einstein’s formula on the definition of success: If we take A for success, the formula: A<0x3D>X+Y+Z, where X is work, Y is rest and Z is holding the tongue behind the teeth.
New and modern.
Hospitals in the Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n Region expect changes of 1.5 billion.
"It is a success, considering that all four of them are in black numbers this year," said Stanislav Mi<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xA1>k.
The total profit of the regional facilities at the moment is about 32 million CZK.
The share of this is mainly higher payments from insurance companies, which are equally favorable for this year.
Even this fact shows that after poor years, hospitals can finally afford more investment.
In Krom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE>, Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n, Uhersk<0xC3><0xBD> Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B> and Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n, this leads to buildings that together will cost almost CZK 1.5 billion.
The long period of time when we were mainly buying appliances has ended.
Now we have to start building new buildings, because without them, top healthcare can not be done, explained the plans of the regional deputy for health Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as.
We look forward to changes in all hospitals.
The builders will be coming to the hospital next year.
In Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n, the suppliers of the new internal pavilion are now being selected for almost CZK 300 million.
In Krom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE> they have a planned addition of dialysis.
Uherské Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B> wants to add a new interior for about 200 million euros to the central pavilion open this year.
And Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n Bata hospital is waiting for the long-delayed construction of a new central income and internal, which will require three quarters of a billion.
In all cases, these are fundamental and often the biggest changes in recent years.
"This is an extremely important step for the whole region, patients and doctors alike," said V<0xC4><0x9B>ra Prouskov<0xC3><0xA1>, the hospital's internal director, for example.
The five-storey building there is expected to be ready in about two years and will offer comfortable equipment for internal and neurology, dialysis, a new ambulance, beds and intensive care unit.
Greater comfort for patients.
The changes, which are widely recognized by patients in particular, will affect all regions.
The new buildings will replace those in which, for example, many sick people lie in one room, on the floor there is only one toilet, the beds are non-removable, the windows are non-sealed and the doctors do not have adequate working conditions.
"For example, our intern was built thirty-five years ago and now it is at the limit of its lifetime," said the director of the Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n hospital, Pavel Calabek.
In a few years it will be replaced by a seven-storey modern building connected to an urgent income.
Doctors and patients will have all the emergency departments in one place, in addition to the new premises.
The same model already has half-finished Uherské Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>.
The central income is already standing, and in three years there will be an intern.
"We will pay for the building from the loan and partly from our own resources," explained Director Petr Sl<0xC3><0xA1>dek.
It is this hospital that can afford its own funding as the only one in the region.
The profit is still the highest and it did not reach the loss even two years ago, when the Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n hospital suffered a loss of almost two hundred million.
"We have good contracts with insurance companies, excellent performance, increase revenues and effectively manage costs throughout the hospital," Vlastimil Vajd<0xC3><0xA1>k, who is in charge of the economy, said.
Patients of the Krom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE> hospital will also see improvement.
In ten to fifteen years, up to half a billion crowns will go into repairs, new appliances and reconstructions.
Already this year, the repair of the capture station will be completed, then the addition of dialysis will begin, or the construction of a building for a new magnetic resonance.

No one has explained to me how I should keep refugees in the country if they do not want to live in the Czech Republic.
Interior Minister Milan Chovanec (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) complains after talks with his European colleagues that other states are pushing the Czech Republic to adopt quotas for the redistribution of refugees, but rejects any discussion.
He also points out that no one has yet explained to him how he should keep the assigned refugees in the Czech Republic when they do not want to live with us anyway.
"We did not get an answer, so we wanted the quotas to be dropped from the final text," Chovanec told reporters.
Can you describe in more detail the position you came up with at the meeting of the Ministers of the Interior and Foreign Affairs of the European Union?
We do not agree with mandatory quotas as with a system that simply cannot work.
We cannot speak of migrants as bags of salt or flour.
They are living beings who have some visions, they are heading somewhere, they have some relatives.
We wanted to hear from our colleagues how we are able to keep migrants on the territory of the Member States if they were to redistribute themselves.
We can't imagine it.
We did not receive an answer and therefore we wanted the quotas to be removed from the final text.
With the other conclusions - functional hotspots, i.e. registration points, border protection, camps outside Europe, trust fund for African countries and other things, we have no problem with that.
We've been talking about this for a year and we say this is the way.
But to say that quotas will solve everything?
We've dealt with forty thousand recently, now it's a hundred and twenty thousand.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how do we keep these people in that territory?
Ninety-eight percent of all people who pass through us want to go to Germany.
Almost no one wants to see us, we just don't know how to keep them here.
Other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others, who take the Czech Republic as their target country, have ambitions to come to us, but the interest of people from this migration wave, that is from Syria and other countries, is close to zero.
You mentioned that refugees don't even want to come to us, but we've already committed to accepting fifteen hundred people.
Wouldn’t it be possible to accept more people this way?
We are committed to accepting 1,500 people, but on condition.
We said: functional hotspots, border protection, military operations.
Even the 1,500 are about to lose 1,100 people with whom we will deal with the asylum procedure.
They'll come to our detention facility and we'll treat them the same as the ones we captured.
It is a big question, and we will be debating with Europe whether we can detain people who will be registered in Italy and in Greece or, if necessary, in Hungary.
Because Europe behaves in such a way that if they have a registration, they cannot be detained.
That is, they will come to our territory with registration, and if there is an agreement, which is not yet, it may happen that even the 1100 will not be kept on the territory of the Czech Republic and they will go back to that Germany upon arrival.
If we are able to detain them for the duration of the asylum procedure, we will arrange an asylum procedure with them.
If it is the citizens of Syria, Eritrea, then almost 98 percent of European statistics say they receive international protection.
They will then receive documents that will allow them to travel around Europe.
And I think these people will end up in the target countries again.
Then there are four hundred people who will relocate.
This is the second project that is underway so far, and we have only made progress there by debating with the churches about the possibility that they could help them find jobs, housing, and so on.
But it's a very long run.
You said that other countries were not willing to discuss the ministerial talks with us.
Isn’t it just that the Czech Republic refuses quotas, but does not offer any solidarity step that would block the discussion?
And what exactly do you think this is a solidary step?
If the Federal Republic of Germany expresses the encouragement that all migrants from Syria can come to them, then the message is spread in the hours after all the camps in Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
This encourages another wave of migration that is heading to Germany because they simply do not want to come to us.
We think the road is to protect the external borders – simply to deter those migratory waves, to help the needy, and to separate economic migrants.
Clearly show them they don’t have a chance.
Last year alone, 50,000 Kosovars came to Germany.
From a safe Kosovo, where we pay for all the saturation of this state, including the police, the courts, the prosecutors.
If we were able to separate them and not accept them or accept them only according to the needs of the economies, then the fifty percent of what social systems spend on them in vain today could go to refugees.
Compared to the first day when Germany introduced controls, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic jumped.
Now it's eighty, the first day it was twelve.
How long will it take for border checks to be tightened?
We were afraid of being caught by hundreds of people.
These are the numbers we can handle.
We still have a few hundred vacancies in stone detention facilities.
Of course, all the people we detain will be returned to Austria within seven days.
We do it by default.
The Austrians are the only ones who take these people from us, with Hungary it's complicated, and the Greeks - it's a completely useless story.
So where is the breaking point?
Would it have to be a thousand a day?
I think it would have to be a few hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day, two, three days in a row, we're going to run out of capacity enough to launch crisis plans.
Then I agreed with the Prime Minister that he would immediately convene an extraordinary government.
He is very interested in the whole thing, we are in telephone contact several times a day.
If the situation arises, the government can de facto sit down immediately and in one resolution decide to strengthen the police for the army, let's say the customs administration, or the prison service.
The extreme variant is the state of emergency, which has now been declared by Hungary in some places?
I don't think it can get that far with us.
Bear in mind that our position is different, we are a national state within Europe, we only have a Schengen border and only at the airport.
I do not know what would have to happen in order for this to happen on the territory of the Czech Republic, I do not want to spread alarming information.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, indicates rather that Hungarians are trying to divert the migratory flow to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct trip to Austria.
This would affect the Czech Republic very marginally, almost at all.
Slavia paid off a large part of her debts at the last minute.
It is trying to prevent the declaration of bankruptcy.
Football Slavia has paid off her debts.
The footballers also received their money.
Football Slavia stood for the first time on Tuesday due to insolvency proceedings in court.
Almost three months after the proposal was submitted by the company Online Services from the Pacific island of Samoa for about 20 million crowns.
Slavia's legal representative, Zuzana Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dkov<0xC3><0xA1>, tried to convince Judge Michaela Wenzlov<0xC3><0xA1> within a few hours that she should not declare bankruptcy over Slavia.
Needless to say, she had arguments.
One of the main arguments was that last week with the new owner of Slavia became a large Chinese industrial and investment group CEFC and also the Czech billionaire Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> <0xC5><0xA0>im<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC4><0x9B>.
Apparently, the money came from the new owners to the club, at the last minute.
This is also evidenced by Slavia's statement before Tuesday's court hearing - the top club on Monday, just a day before the hearing in court, sent tens of millions of crowns in debt.
"Everything was paid for between September 11 and September 15," lawyer Slavie Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dkov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
Who did Slavia pay?
To current and former players and business partners.
Specifically, the former Slovak representative Milan Ivan or the Czech midfielder Maria Li<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
Slavia also paid the fee to agent Alexandr Losenick.
On Friday, the club also paid the city of Prague 10 dues.
The de facto part of the insolvency dispute thus remains only the claims that Slavia disputes.
According to the club, the obligations did not arise at all, or there are legal disputes.
However, we are prepared to pay the amount in case of loss of these disputes.
"We have the necessary funds in the bank account, which we can prove by a statement from the account," Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dkov<0xC3><0xA1>, a lawyer, told the judge.
"Everything that was due is repaid," Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dkov<0xC3><0xA1> said, adding that only insolvent or contradictory liabilities were not repaid.
It is also certain that in the coming days the judge will not decide and the proceedings will continue.
She gave Slavia three weeks to send detailed evidence that she actually paid off the debts mentioned.
All the evidence will then be evaluated.
The decision can therefore be expected at the beginning of November.
The judge ordered the continuation of the hearing on the third of November.
However, the decision will not be taken at this meeting, but only in writing after it.

FastMig X is a representative of the latest generation of inverter welding sources.
The combination of state-of-the-art technology, hardware and software equipment integrated into the modular design brings benefits and a quick return on investment in the form of high quality, productivity and reliability.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final assembly is always configured according to customer requirements.
From welding structural steel to welding special alloys, as well as from welding of rough materials to welding of thin sheets, from applications in workshops to welding in shipyards.
The incredible number of welding curves, the simple setup and expandability of the welding source allow you to react quickly to changing requirements, leading to reduced downtime, the need to change the source, and more productive welding.
FastMig X enables welding by cutting-edge welding processes, developed by Kemppi, that ensure higher productivity and welding quality.
It stops wasting time and there is no waste of material or repair of faulty welds.
Flexibility is ensured, there is less downtime, more welding and higher profit.
This year’s novelty premiered in Nitra, where she also won a gold medal.
We greatly appreciate these honors, as they confirm the exceptionality of the product.
The world’s leading manufacturers can boast of similar systems, but due to differences in software and parameter management, FastMig X is one of the world’s leading systems.
For the interested parties, the delivery times are certainly pleasant, which range around three weeks.
In the Czech Republic, we have already established the first contacts, which will surely expand after the Brno trade fair.
We have been its regular participants for more than twenty years and almost always our business results are better than before, emphasizes Miroslav Streichsbier, head of Kemppi in Pilsen, for ARC-H.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final assembly is always configured according to customer requirements.
Blank could be built so that it wouldn't collapse.
But it would cost half a billion more, says the expert from the company that designed the tunnel.
It could have been safer, the expert said.
The Blanka tunnel complex could be built so that there would not be two landslides in Prague’s Stromovka, says Satra’s production director, who is the main designer of the tunnel, Alexandr Butovi<0xC4><0x8D>.
He said it on Wednesday evening during a journalistic survey of the tunnel.
He said it would be worth about half a billion dollars.
It will open to drivers on Saturday afternoon.
It’s always a compromise between price and security.
"The tunnel could have been built safer, but the costs are increasing exponentially," Butovic said.
According to him, the conditions in Stromovka were the same all the time, yet the country fell just a few steps from where it began to arrive by a safer and more careful method.
"If the measure were used 500 meters earlier, the tunnel would be half a billion more expensive," Butovi<0xC4><0x87> said.
The Blanka tunnel collapsed three times during construction.
Twice, in 2008, a crater was created in Stromovec, and in 2010 the land collapsed at the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to the director of Metrostav Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlava, the tunnel is unnecessarily expensive, he told the weekly Euro.
The building was originally planned to cost 17 billion crowns.
If we add to that the VAT that jumped twice during the construction period, out of seventeen billion, you have twenty-one.
When technology, land purchases and engineering activities, valorization and similar items are added, it is 29 billion, which is not that far from the 37, B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlav said.
Someone ordered it and paid for it.
iOS 9: How to Get a New iPhone Operating System with a New Apple Update
A new operating system may be required in Settings by clicking on the "General" tab and selecting "Software Update".
When it is ready, your phone will offer you the option to download and then install it.
Some users encountered a problem after installing, specifically the error "software update failed" message.
One solution to this problem is to wait for the update to fade, or try it through iTunes.
Your phone will take you through the update process.
And this includes the need to uninstall the app to free up space - this will not be necessary, however, because Apple has reduced the update and also facilitated the whole process thanks to the use of a special tool that will suggest the user to delete and reinstall the app after the update is over.
Make sure your phone is charged before you start the update.
If the battery status is low, Apple will not allow the update to run, because interrupting the process could cause an update error.

FedEx Profits Mixed, Reduced Fiscal Outlook for 2016
FedEx has reported unsatisfactory results over the past quarter and a huge decline in its forecast of year-round profits due to low demand for freight and higher costs per land division.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers over the holidays.
During this period last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
The company’s shares fell about 2.5 percent in pre-emptive trading 45 minutes before Wednesday’s opening.
FedEx says it expects earnings between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending next May, down 20 cents from the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The reduced outlook comes despite an average 4.9 percent increase in interest rates, which will manifest itself in January.4, and higher surcharges for heavy or large parcel land transport starting in November.
The company said it still expects profit growth from the previous year due to lower costs, higher revenues and growth in online trading.
Fred Smith, Chairman and CEO, said the company “has delivered solid performance despite weaker-than-expected economic conditions, particularly in the manufacturing industry and global trade.”
Holiday hiring plans were announced the day after rival UPS said it plans to hire an additional 90,000 to 95,000 workers, which is roughly the same as they hired last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6 percent from last year.
Profit per share was $2.42, which is less than $2.44 per share, as predicted by 12 analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research.
Sales increased by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts polled by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decline in priority international shipping, causing revenues in its Express unit to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping has boosted the results of the FedEx ground unit.
In the last quarter, land revenues rose by 29 percent, but operating profit was essentially the same due to higher prices for larger packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded higher income due to higher base rates, while the profit decreased in freight trade due to higher labour prices.
In pre-emptive trading, about an hour before the opening of FedEx shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They ended Tuesday with a decline of 11 percent per year and 17 percent below the June 11 record.
At their most anticipated meeting in years, federal reserve legislators will spend two days this week sitting at a 27-foot-long Honduran mahogany table and will decide whether it’s time to raise the key interest rate after nearly a decade.
Stretching over them at one end of the central bank ornament, the two-story meeting room will be a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed President Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the nation’s economic interests above everything else.
The central bank has a double charge from Congress: maximizing American employment and keeping prices stable.
But since the Great Recession, the Fed has recognized that there is an unwritten third term: financial stability.
And this third term could be an X-factor in too close to a predictable decision to be announced on Thursday about whether the U.S. economy is ready to kick-start when it pulls out of an unprecedented stimulus in the form of a near-zero short-term interest rate on the spot since the end of 2008.
While most of the data shows solid economic growth, recent turbulence in the world’s financial markets could already scare the cautious Fed into adding to the volatility by raising its reference rate of federal funds – even by just a quarter of a percentage point.
“It’s clear that the labor market and inflation will be the most important thing to watch first,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“But I think they were just looking for an excuse to not increase the rate, the heightened uncertainty surrounding the global market already provides them with sufficient justification to wait any longer,” she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself is causing nervousness in the financial markets.
About half of the economists recently polled by Blomberg predicted a rate hike this week.
However, the financial markets expect the Fed to delay the matter, with a key indicator only about 30% chance of an increase.
This would point to a decline in the stock market if the Fed raises rates, only if politicians mitigate the decline by promising that further increases are imperceptible.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The meeting was launched with the expectation that Fed policymakers will delay rates this week in a quiet manner, says John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
“It would be a surprise if the Fed raises rates now,” he said.
If the Fed did, “they would have to go to the extremes in their program statement and hold the hands of the financial markets so that panic wouldn’t break out.”
Other experts argued that raising rates would calm the financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about how the Fed would proceed.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed on track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the U.S. economic recovery.
Yellen said she expects higher rates this year through spring and early summer, despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, the labour market saw solid growth this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% in the previous month, the lowest in more than seven years, and is close to what the Fed considers full employment.
Salary gains showed signs of lifting.
And while inflation continues to fall below the central bank’s annual 2% target, Fed policymakers say the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy “can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the tightness in the labor market,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world began to slump at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell up to 16% below its record value in May as investors feared the slowing Chinese economy would drag down global growth.
The market has somewhat rebounded this month and the Dow is now losing only nearly 10% of the May maximum.
The uneasy market situation provides the Fed’s policy makers with a comprehensive calculation of when to start raising interest rates.
“In the absence of what has happened in the financial markets, and reports of the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, there would be a tightening at this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior research fellow at UCLA’s Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official.
Now he predicts that they will wait at least a month to gain better control over the consequences.
“There’s a lot of uncertainty about what impact this will have on the U.S. economy, and they have almost no data they can rely on about the latest developments in China,” Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the main interests of the Fed, so technically it should not be included in their decision-making.
But in reality, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the whole world.
The influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.
A mere hint by then-President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could “ask” their monetary expansion in the market has triggered cramps around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interconnected, Fed officials can be expected to follow developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central bankers and experts to better read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is “more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, head of global wealth-management strategy at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Va., noted this month that "the Fed has a history of exaggerated movements in financial markets that seem incompatible with economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Policy Committee who pushed for higher rates, cited the 1998-99 decision as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to lower its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage point during three meetings “Despite limited identifiable impacts on U.S. growth,” Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials reversed these cuts.
The Fed should prioritize concerns about financial stability only during a major crisis, such as the 2008 market crash, said Adam Posen S., a former member of the Bank of England’s rate-setting committee.
The latest turmoil is not even approaching this level, he said.
“You certainly don’t want to be in a situation of fear of rising rates because markets have become upset,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a double mandate and doesn't mention financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think they should get to the top.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, the Chinatown.
The market/warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it's a Chinese neighborhood, not a Thai neighborhood.
The Market/Store is the only contact point that offers an astonishing range of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and kitchen utensils, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There is even a car part if you need some engine oil.
The shop is massive and it will take you over an hour to cross all the streets.
If you’re hungry for all of this shopping, head to the LAX-C BBQ Express for a meal.
The internal trading booth (good, cheap) is close to the registers and has various pick-up points.
What's in stock: Do you need anything - anything - Thai?
You'll probably find it in LAX-C.
Items are affordable and a lot of items are sold in bulk.
Fresh produce includes special Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruits and more.
The spread of meat is great, for example, fish - the staff behind the counter will wash you and debone you, even fry it if you wish,
A good part of the shop is left to the massive freezing section, where you will find frozen cumin leaves, bitter melon and galangal, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork intestines, fish balls, regional sausages, free-market semi-finished products and more.
Who buys here: Restaurant owners and chefs, also single families and individuals.
The wide alleys face shopping carts and forklifts.
Find: Fresh monthong durian next to the cash register stand.
Where it is located: The store is in the industrial part of Los Angeles, surrounded by the suburbs of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
While the store may be busy, parking is usually not hard to find.
The speed on the highways will remain the same.
Acceleration to 150 km/h was rejected by the House.
On selected sections of the motorway it will not be possible to increase the maximum speed to 150 km/h under favourable conditions.
On Tuesday, the House decided to do so when it acceded to a Senate amendment that rejected the speed-up.
The amendment to the Land Communications Act will now go to the President.
President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman said at the end of April that he would veto a law allowing the speed of 100 km/h.
The increase was also opposed by Transport Minister Dan <0xC5><0xA4>ok (for ANO), according to which the Czech highway network is not yet built at such a speed.
On Tuesday, he endorsed the Senate version of the bill.
The approved amendment will now allow, in line with the original government proposal, to increase the speed from 90 to 110 kilometers per hour on selected first-class roads, especially four-lane ones.
The House first extended this option to highways, which could be driven at selected speeds of up to 150 km/h, but the Senate rejected it.
MEPs have now agreed to his proposal.
Senators, with the approval of the Minister of Transport, also removed from the amendment the permission of the transport police to have the final say in the modification of local communications, which are taken care of by the municipality.
The Senate version approved by the House also expects that sewers, water pipes or cables of public lighting can be stored longitudinally under the surface of roads.
This would save the city for the purchase of land.
Municipalities should also not be required to take care of road vegetation along local roads regardless of the owner of the relevant land.
The amendment also aims to help improve road protection and make it easier for municipalities to handle towed vehicles that owners do not report to.
New municipalities could sell towed vehicles, for which their owners do not register within six months of notification of the towing.
The municipalities will have the possibility to exclude transit freight transport through their territory on the roads of second and third classes under the threat of a fine also for forwarding companies.
The amendment also abolishes the possibility of introducing electronic road markings instead of existing paper ones, which will continue to be used after 1 January next year.
According to the government, this will save money on the introduction of an electronic system.
The <0xC3><0x9A>stek expressor goes to court.
He's 10 years at risk for overpriced welcomes from the locals.
The case concerns an allegedly overpriced Welcome to the Villages project.
The police wanted to prosecute MEP Zuzana Kailova (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) in this case, but the Chamber of Deputies did not hand her over.
According to the legal qualification of the case, both face up to ten years in prison.
The main painting is currently scheduled for two days in October.
According to prosecutor Mand<0xC3><0xAD>k and Mac<0xC3><0xAD>k, they caused damage of at least one million crowns, according to the prosecution.
The applicant relies on an expert opinion.
According to the plaintiff, the former members of the city’s leadership unlawfully made it possible to obtain the property benefit of the company, which organized the welcoming of the communes.
According to the indictment, Mand<0xC3><0xAD>k ordered the then head of the department of municipal services, education and culture to address five connected companies in the competition.
When another company entered the competition that offered the lowest price, the town hall canceled the competition.
The city was then to entrust the contract to the administrator and only Darothore entered the competition, which was then awarded by the city council.
The city paid at least a million more.
Both charges, led with the aim of ensuring that Darothore is awarded a public contract for the organization of the Welcome of the Communes event in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem, have long and coordinated at least in contravention of the requirement for a procedure with the care of the proper economy, writes the prosecutor.
At the same time, he said, they were aware that Darothore would subsequently charge <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem for the implementation of the Welcome of Locals event, which would be disproportionately increased compared to the real value of the services actually provided.
In three years, the company has collected more than CZK 5 million for the project.
In the end, the city paid only one part, about CZK 1.7 million, and then withdrew from the contract.
According to the expert opinion, the amount paid was at least one million crowns overpriced.
Mand<0xC3><0xAD>k has previously denied any violation of the law.
I didn't commit any crime, I'm innocent.
“I don’t understand this constructed case,” the former mayor said earlier, adding that the city under his leadership was only following up on a similar project from previous years.
From 2008 to 2010, the event was hosted by Roxy II.
"It was on the same terms, for the same money," Mand<0xC3><0xAD>k added.
The criminals also wanted to accuse MEP Kail, who was also a member of the city council.
But the House of Representatives did not give her up for prosecution.
Forensic experts have therefore postponed the case in her case, but they expect Kail to be indicted after her parliamentary term ends.
Welcoming the locals was a social event that took place several times a year.
The mothers received a gift check of 5,000 crowns for the purchase of children's necessities and small gifts.
Hungarian police have reportedly released a dog to the refugee.
Then they forced the journalists to erase the record.
Hungarian police reportedly briefly detained an AP cameraman at the border with Serbia and forced him to erase a record of a police dog allegedly hitting a refugee on the ground.
The Hungarian government, however, disputes this accusation.
The alleged incident took place on Saturday evening when AP cameraman Luca Muzi filmed migrants crossing the border with Serbia through a cornfield near the Hungarian city of Röszke.
Police intervened against the refugees, and one of them attacked a Syrian by attacking a dog with a hamster basket.
The dog of a man who shouted "Please, please, I'm a fugitive," muzzled, Muzi says.
The fact that Muzi is filming everything was noticed by one of the police officers and did not allow him to leave.
The journalist was no longer allowed to call his superiors or colleagues on the spot.
Police took Muzi to a dark spot at the refugee registration center and asked him to show them what he had recorded.
Then they ordered him to erase the record.
In this way, Muzi lost the result of two days of work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt he was in danger because there were dogs nearby.
The AP sent a protest letter to Hungarian government spokesman Zolt<0xC3><0xA1>n Kov<0xC3><0xA1>cs.
She called the behaviour of police officers unacceptable and said journalists should be able to cover events without risking physical violence and not having to worry that the government would destroy legally obtained material.
Kov<0xC3><0xA1>cs, referring to the police report of Muzi's account of the events, challenged it.
He said the police just wanted the reporter to show them if they were on some footage, which they said they were entitled to.
When they found out they weren't there, they didn't force him to erase anything.
"Dogs can bark - they're trained to deter and chase fear a bit, but they're not sure to attack," says Kov<0xC3><0xA1>cs.
The unpredictable Champions League.
Winning at City kicks us, believes Juventus
"It's a disappointment, I don't think we deserved to lose," said Manuel Pellegrini, coach of home City.
We had more chances and played better than Juventus.
It was a classic Champions League game.
Not a single team created a lot of opportunities, but we had the ball on the pitch longer.
"The reason for the defeat was not in tactics, Juventus just scored two beautiful goals," said Pellegrini, whose team had won the match after 636 minutes.
The finalist of last season Juventus on this was exactly the opposite before the clash - after the first three rounds of the Italian league as a defender of the title has only a point and with a score of 2:4 is located only on the 16th place of the table.
The return to Etihad Stadium was a surprise.
"This win will help us mentally, kick us," says coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three bases - Pirla, Tévez and Vidal - before the new year.
Pogba, Manjuki<0xC4><0x87> and Morata were represented in Manchester.
"That's right, this victory is very important, and hopefully it will lead us to the winning wave," Morata hopes.
Because when we're on it, we're one of the best teams in Europe.
In the second half we were better, especially in the attacking phase.
I think my players deserve this result.
"We could have scored 0-2 before our goal, but Gianluigi held us back," coach Allegri Buffon said.
"We've burned a few good chances," Yayu Touré, City's backer, hated.
We need to take the experience from the Champions League and next time try to get a better result.
Goodbye Angelo, goodbye old Germany II.
Before we continue on the issue of immigrants, we should realize that all this media shivering around is being handled by professionals.
According to the needs of the media and also from above.
So let's stop for a moment.
Today, newspapers and media are full of children carrying their parents on the dusty roads of the exodus.
And this automatically evokes a feeling of guilt and compassion in man - that is, in the European man.
Well, they don't come here just desperate babies, notice on the footage of the boats landing to the Greek islands that the baby is not so much seen on them!
Somehow, the pictures of the ships heading for Lampedusa, refugees off the French border near Menton, whose beautiful promenades are home to thousands of young men, have disappeared from the television lately.
For the most part, young black people.
And then there's the pictures of Callais, where these men are eating and the black men are waiting to see if they can get through the tunnel under La Manche.
I don't think he cares anymore.
Even the pictures of the primitive Christian church of the Eritreans made no special impression on the inhabitants of Europe.
It was too much of a fake.
So when it comes to quotas for refugees, it is somehow hidden that it is not only the unfortunate children from Syria, but also the fashionable - for the elderly: fashionable - young men.
Their muscles look like they've just come out of a fitness center.
Only one personal experience.
This summer on the Turkish - Muslim - part of Cyprus we lay on the private beach of the hotel.
Despite the fact that it was private, a large group of cars suddenly arrived at the beach.
But no hams.
And out of them came the young black men.
About thirty men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30 years.
They went to the beach, all dressed in branded clothes and shoes, in their hands, otherwise, smartphones.
The fact that it was a private beach did not interest them, and the employees – the Turks, the Muslims! – were obviously afraid of them.
They've occupied all the loungers.
Whoever wasn't lying on it and was in the sea, had bad luck.
They were dressed as if they were from an American rapper movie.
On the heads of the hat with nail, white and colored adidas shoes on the legs.
Then they surrounded the local beach bar and started hanging out.
They sat around tables, stuffed themselves next to the sitting eaters and white guests of the bar - reading to Muslims and Europeans without asking.
Mothers and children fled from the dining terrace somewhere calm.
The incoming Negroes drank beer straight out of the thirds - as in U.S. TV series?! - at the beach throwing empty bottles around them.
They kept yelling loudly at each other.
It wasn't English, of course.
Then they went to drink wine, also straight from the bottles.
They jumped into the hotel pool - in branded swimsuits, especially the young ladies -, screaming and screaming in the water, mothers and children and pensioners fled in horror, and in half an hour there was not a single black guest on the beach or in the pool.
They're all gone.
It doesn’t matter if you are a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel staff were afraid to even talk about them.
The waiter said to me in a half-voiced voice in the evening, "Did you see the gold you were wearing?"
"Yes," I said.
"Well, they certainly didn't do it from work," said the waiter.
I remembered, "I know, they all had massive gold chains around their necks.
And one of them had a massive gold cross about 20 centimeters long on his neck.
And women were like goldsmiths.
"Are they drug smugglers?" I asked.
'You've seen them drink, 'the waiter said.
They don't take drugs, and they don't take them.
They're smuggling something completely different.
So I realized what they were smuggling.
However, in June 2105, it was not so important to me.
I had no idea what was going to happen next.
But the secret services and top politicians should have known first.
I don't think they'd know.
About 1.5 million immigrants came to Europe at the time.
And they go and they go and they go.
Today it has turned out that the main problem of the European Union is that totalitarian-politically correct politicians, like intellectuals, and the lobbyist and economically important groups attached to them, have the greatest strength in Europe.
Germany and its politicians - the already publicly recognised main force in Europe - lie, lie and lie - but not only they, but also the tops of the EU and television, including ours.
For example, recent television images of the enthusiastic welcome of refugees in Germany are at the level of images of Moscow TV from August 1968.
Sure, there were a couple of sunflowers at the station, but mostly - the Old Germans - the Muslims welcomed their companions.
For weeks, they have been blabbering in the news on Czech TV, as according to some research, Germans are almost all for the arrival of emigrants.
However, those who have only been in Germany for a few days know that it is a lie like a tower.
Which confirms further information.
For example, famous public opinion research organized by ARD - Czech Association of Public Television Companies of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to the ARD, a week ago, more than 50% of Germans wanted to take in even more refugees.
This was also reported by our television.
However, they hid what broke out the next day in Germany: that the poll on the article showed that 94.5% of Germans no longer want any immigrants - polls were attended by 67,000 people.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly declared in November 2010, that is, five years ago: "Our effort for a multi-cult society has totally failed."
She said: “Germany is giving up the fight for a multicultural society.”
"All efforts to coexist have failed."
In a country where four million Muslims live, a strategy that has allowed people from different cultural backgrounds to live side by side without integrating has not been proven. Today they live here with us and we have been lying for some time that they will not stay, that one day they will disappear again.
But that's not reality.
A multicultural approach, when we say that we simply live happily together, this approach has failed.
He totally failed.
But even Merkel may not have the strength to go against the powerful of Germany and Europe and, above all, against political correctness.
It shows the escalation of events.
The conflict is rapidly escalating.
The Euro-German Schulz, the President of the European Parliament, a member of the SPD, the only one who allegedly does not even have a degree in the European Parliament - yes, that is the one Berlusconi said in the EU parliament could play a supervisor in a concentration camp from a minute ago -, as he has shown several times.
It seems, especially under the impression of the last statements of German politicians, that Germany has crossed the Rubicon.
Note that, apart from some, most European politicians do not support these statements, the citizens of countries that were victims of Nazism are terrified.
What happened to the Germans?
With those rich, successful, and solid Germans?
Which years have they tried, at least externally, to deal with their horrific past of the aggressor and murderer of millions?
Are those right who say that in the soul of Germany there is a devil of aggression, superiority and violence?
Was Chancellor Otto von Bismarck right when he stopped with all his might the attempts of the Great Germans to control the whole centre of Europe?
When did he say that the great German idea would destroy Germany?
I guess he did.
When it was decommissioned, preparations for World War I began.
The idea of Greater Germany, which brought Germany and Europe into two wars that cost millions of lives, probably returned in a different form.
After the attempt of the Marxists to dominate the state, for example with the Rote Armee Fraktion, and after the failure of the GDR, a new German ideology began to develop in Germany based on ecology, which was, by the way, one of the main ideologies of Nazism.
We'd call it sunshine.
The German elites have long resisted the rise of German nationalism, leaving all those fighters against the atom in peace, enthusiasts looking for paradise for all, quietly supporting the old imperial and Nazi slogan Our forest must live.
In order to satisfy the restless young people who want to do something different and better all over the world, they have completely bowed to the side of the global warming fighters, stopped nuclear power plants, etc.
And they forgot that in this stream there is also a strong anti-Semitic – so-called pro-Palestinian – and an anti-Slavic current that considers all Slavs a difficult verbose – from the time of Karl Marx, who, according to the parents of the Jews, was mainly a German nationalist.
And also, as the latest statements of Schulz and German ministers openly threatening the disobedient Eastern states show, the idea of a leading Germany.
Which needs to be listened to without apology.
Otherwise, woe to you!
And when we mix in the fact that immigrants are a very influential group of voters, we have what we have.
And behind it, as always, is capital, especially German capital, which suits it and which stems from the fact that Germany actually controls most of the states of Europe through banks and the Union.
The pseudo-Sunflowers first introduced the Germans into the swamps of ecology and multiculturalism and today brought them home and will still bring millions of Muslims.
Those who, seduced by the siren voices, will soon hit the wall of reality that Merkel does not want to see, and will begin to storm.
Germany can only again threaten its neighbours with force, again a part of its inhabitants - but, as it seems, a smaller part - can ideologically decapitate it, but in the end reality, as always, will reach it.
Will Germany be on fire again?
Muslim hostels are on fire.
What will the German government do when German public protests against incoming Islamists erupt?
Do Muslims who have been living in Germany for a long time come to their aid, but who are certainly not assimilated to adopt local customs and laws?
What will the German government do when the naturalized Muslims, incoming Islamists and Germans, fearing the Islamization of their country, let themselves in?
What will it do to the Germans, and indeed to Germany, when people rise up who will protest loudly and publicly against the new Euro-superman Muslim?
Germany has simply changed.
The conflict that has been sparked in Europe by the support of the solar ideology, i.e. the ideology of the elite and basically totalitarian, and of its insatiable banks, is growing.
And because of the uncompromising treatment of disobeying democratic Germans and all the inferior and disobeying Eastern neighbours, it cannot do well.
Finished tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of intruders: scare them to death.
Just knock and a sturdy flap will knock on you in a way that the weaker nature does not have to stop.
The living head will wipe you nicely, and the dead will be driven away, accompanied (or rather driven away) by an irresistible salesman and a living statue.
Maybe it's a pity that the speaker's clatter can't actually be acquired.
We'd also like to get rid of a lot of squabbles and filth.
Juicy cornicula (Oxalis corniculata).
A small weed that tolerates dry environments.
And so it is located among the outdoor tiles near my residence.
On September 16, 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant, which, although it belongs to the expansive weeds, creates a nice impression in terms of flowering.
It is located between the outdoor tiles.
She's untraceable, she's doing well in our garden.
She likes a dry environment, is easily adaptable, modest and unpretentious.
Although he creates leaves with a chaotic composition, it is worth observing it and continuing to photograph it.
Under the microscope is only the beauty of the detail - yellow flowers and green leaves also with a purple accompaniment.
Brazilian pediatrics company Rio Grande promotes healthy diet while breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatrics company SPRS came up with a shocking way to try to convey to women the knowledge about the importance of a good diet while breastfeeding using images of babies sucking from the breasts painted by depicting unhealthy food.
Human breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that provide infants with all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to excessive energy requirements, pregnant women and new-born mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that increased calorie intake is not the only dietary measure that mothers should follow.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually influenced the genetic makeup of their children and protected them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, it was also confirmed that unhealthy diets negatively affected the child’s immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates rates, although Nine's is trying to take the lead on Today Show
With Karla Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson coming to Canberra to cover the costs of the liberal leadership’s evasion, it was not possible to create a sufficient rating boost for Today.
The morning show Nine aired from national capital after the overthrow of Malcolm Turnbull by Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise with host David Koch and Samantha Armytage has stuck in London as part of a week-long international television series that also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
Aussie TV did not seem to care so much about this tyranny of distance to viewers, as it recorded an average of 397,000 viewers in five major cities compared to 330,000 viewers on Today.
Today saw a smaller increase in its rating compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but their number was only last Thursday (343,000).
Today has filled the gap on Sunrise in recent months.
In August, there were an average of 318,000 in Today, compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise had an average of 349,000 spectators and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change are influencing more this morning than just parliament, friends!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for your enquiry!
Added TODAY on Monday, September 14, 2015
The big news for Seven was the stunning debut of 800 words with former star Packed to the Rafters Eric Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to move with his two children to the seaside part of New Zealand, has an average of very impressive 1.219 million viewers.
Critics have questioned whether Thomson himself could pull off a television hit without starring Rafters Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night is a clear "yes".
The X Factor from Seven retained a strong 1.136 million viewers, smoothly defeating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven recorded mixed surveillance on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour of a new TV quiz (from 5 p.m. to 5:30 p.m.) by Andrew O'Keefe' had an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half (from 17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 spectators — enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuire (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half hour of The Chase Australia averaged 520,000 spectators and the second half had an incredible 720,000.
The Hot Seat averaged 620,000.
Due to the fall in The Chase Australia's second night rating, Nine will be convinced that Hot Seat will eventually win at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is replaced by Million Dollar Minute, which failed to beat McGuire's show.

Three in the final agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect boy – but who will he choose?
Secrets Revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have inadvertently found out who will win the Bachelor.
The woman with whom Sam Wood comes to Bachelor is shrouded in an insurmountable secret.
And the three girls who stay standing will definitely not tell you who the real one is who gets the rose in the end.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezany Markoski, and Lany Jeavons-Fellows the day before they were just two, they ungratefully told us who would win.
Sam Wood holds his tongue for Thursday's final
All three women lyrically chanted why Wood is the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positivity as reasons why they would like to be his partner.
Anyway, when asked, "If not, which one will get Wood's final flower?", their answers could act as a spoiler about who gets Bachelor's heart.
Both the Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay as the one that would be best suited to Wood besides them.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been in an easy relationship ever since.
“From the moment I walked into the house and watched Sarah and Sam’s energy, I felt they were quite compatible and I still think so throughout the course,” says Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is a really earthy woman, she's a lot of fun with her," Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and there's the right chemistry between them.
They feel good and comfortable together.
Sarah Mackay thinks they could make a good couple with Sam Wood.
She claims to have realised during his last home visits that Wood could be "the real one."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this was no longer just a game - I opened my whole heart to him now."
I asked who Wood would choose, if not her, she looked mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I like both girls equally - it's indecisive between Snezena and Lana.
Bachalor is broadcast on Wednesday at 7.30am on Ten.

Jarry Hayne had several options where to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest after his move to the United States and many teams questioned his great start to training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsul and it looks like a sensible decision.
Some coaches let Hayne sit for the rest of the season because he made a mistake, which led to the Australian rugby league's conversion in the first overtime kick in Tuesday's 20:3 win over Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed he had confidence in the player and gave him another chance to come back and put him in the game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula was also still honest in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of having the rookies chewed in front of the rest of the team, he was able to encourage them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at a press conference after the match.
49ers reporter Cam Inman said Hayne was also encouraged by a special team coordinator, Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about the mistake and only take care of the next game.
In the first quarter against the Minnesota Vikings, Jarry Hayne corrected his mistake.
It was certainly not the start Hayne and his massive Australian fan club had hoped for in his NFL debut.
Hayne was caught bloating when he mistakenly left the field and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 a worse start to his NFL career than he could have imagined.
"That's what happens, you just focus on the next game and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the embarrassment to his original debut in 2007, when a recording in his own goal area led to the Queensland Troy.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old player.
Hayne posted a photo of fans holding the Australian flag on his own Instagram after the game.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Russia’s richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested with targeted pistols on a Siberian ranch.
After he openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos confiscated, and his democratic efforts curtailed.
The U.S. was represented by emigrants who demanded the restitution of their property.
The couple emigrated in 1984 and their property was acquired by a new owner.
After 1989 it was no longer possible to return the property, so the couple turned to the state for compensation under the law on extrajudicial rehabilitations.
The court first awarded them the amount requested, i.e. more than CZK 2.8 million, but the court of appeal changed their claim by granting them only less than CZK 90,000, citing that the amount of compensation is determined according to the 1991 price regulations.
The emigrants were sued by the Supreme Court and charged with the amount originally charged.
The Ministry of Finance, which was supposed to pay the money, however, addressed a complaint to the <0xC3><0x9A>S.
In the meantime, there has been such a change in social and economic conditions that the compensation granted under the legislation in force at that time - although it was an adequate compensation in relation to the deprived property - today only reaches a fraction of the value of the property.
"This cannot go to the burden of side-participants as in the restitution of entitled persons who have been claiming their rights at least since 1995 and who have not had the opportunity to be granted compensation before," said Judge Jaroslav Fenyk, the reporter, explaining why the <0xC3><0x9A>S stood on the side of emigrants.
"The U.S. has repeatedly advocated that the general courts proceed in restitution cases in such a way that possible inconsistencies are not interpreted to the detriment of the entitled persons and that the purpose of restitution legislation, i.e. the acquittal of property damage caused by acts of the previous totalitarian state, is always achieved."
Evita in the musical Studio DVA is now portrayed by Radka Fi<0xC5><0xA1>arov<0xC3><0xA1>.
By the way, Radka Fi<0xC5><0xA1>arov<0xC3><0xA1> became the world’s youngest Evita when she played the role of the wife of the Argentine dictator Eva Per<0xC3><0xB3>n in the first Czech performance of this famous musical by Andrew Lloyd Weber and Time Rice at the Spiral Theatre in Prague in 1998.
Returning to the same role, he says: "To date, the performance has not been much matched by Evita's demands."
Evita is not only an amazing role, it is also a responsibility.
She was recommended by Monika Absolon for the role of First Lady of Argentina.
I have seen Monca three times in Evita and it was definitely inspiring for me.
Suddenly, I saw a whole new concept.
I am quite a fan of more modern modifications, but this one is just particularly successful.
"The direction of Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Sokola is original, light and contemporary," says Fi<0xC5><0xA1>arov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The musical scepter between the two singers will be imaginatively handed over at Monika Absolonova’s birthday concert on September 27th from 7 pm at the Studio DVA theatre.
The evening will culminate in songs from the musical Evita.

4 Killed After Police Shoot Rubber Projectiles at Protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets at a crowd of protesters against a new state constitution proposal, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday evening in Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the chief district officer, said more than 1,000 demonstrators gathered outside the police station and some threw stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr. Dhakal says the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber projectiles.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, it said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber projectiles, which are known for their ability to kill, but are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative, apparently caused a high death toll.
The clash was the last week of violent demonstrations across the southern plain of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say they have established a new province under the proposed new constitution, and mitigated their political influence.
Further demonstrations in western Nepal were also recorded by the ethnic group Tharus, which calls for the creation of its own state.
Since August 10, at least 40 people have been killed in violent clashes, including 11 police officers.
When four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces — a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on the new constitution has been ongoing since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after a devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Legislators in Kathmandu this week voted on the provisions of the draft constitution, and officials say the new charter should be adopted by Sunday.
Definitely not to panic now.
After losing on the ice of champion Litv<0xC3><0xAD>nov, you did not even manage a home duel with Sparta ice hockey players (3:5).

I hope nothing like that happens again.

NHC predicts 60 percent probability of cyclone south of Cape Verde
The wide low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verdean islands has a 60 percent chance of a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure system about in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60 percent chance of a tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, the Miami-based weather forecaster added.
Google has launched a campaign to raise $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) said it is launching a campaign aimed at raising $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have flooded European states fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google announced this on its blog in a very unusual way.
The report was published on her blog by Google employee Rita Masoud, based on her personal experience when she fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old.
"We traveled in many dark trains and buses and we experienced hunger, thirst, winter and fear," Masoud said.
I was lucky.
But the deteriorating migrant crisis in Europe is making more and more families like mine willing to help.
All donations will be distributed among 4 non-profit organisations helping refugees and immigrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
According to Google, all contributions made via google.com/refugeerelief will be doubled to $5.5 million.
Europe is facing the largest wave of refugees since World War II, most of them from Syria, wracked by a four-year war that this year alone expelled 4 million people.
Many people also flee war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For mildly obese diabetics, weight loss surgery could be useful
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say whether people with mildly obese type 2 diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who are given non-surgical treatment.
“Death rates take a long time to show,” says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery, who wrote an introduction to the new study of JAMA surgery.
Surgery for weight loss, bariatric surgery use various methods to reduce the stomach.
Reduce hunger and limit the human body to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the research was conducted on people with morbid obesity with a body weight index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
The BMI, which measures the weight-to-height ratio, is considered normal in values between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or higher indicates an overweight person and people over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new study, researchers at Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan have used data collected from a 2007 study that deals with two types of bariatric surgery — gastric bypass and gastric tractomy — in the treatment of type 3 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.
The average BMI among those who underwent surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 at the end of their fifth year, according to the study.
Meanwhile, the BMI of those who were not given surgical treatment for diabetes remained approximately the same at 29.
Among patients with surgery, diabetes was completely resolved in 36 percent and in part in 28 cases.
In the treatment group, diabetes was completely resolved in only 1 percent and in part only in about 2 percent of patients.
Furthermore, blood pressure control, triglycerides, and “bad” LDL cholesterol were shown to be “generally better in the surgical group,” the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient’s level of hemoglobin A1c in the blood, which reflects ongoing blood sugar levels in the body.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, researchers say.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
In the treatment group, however, this value remained at about 8 percent.
But this better “glycemic control” — which is reflected in better hemoglobin A1c levels — did not reduce mortality in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results with two types of operations.
After the fifth year, the bypass group lost more weight compared to the gastrectomy group (18.7 vs 14.2 kg), achieved greater decreases in BMI (7.4 vs 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 per cent vs 2.1 per cent) and were more likely to relapse diabetes (46.9 per cent vs 16.7 per cent).
While the new study does not show improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of stronger people in Sweden, where they found that surgery leads to life extension, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to a Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery were about 29 percent more likely to survive in the next 15 years, compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show any improvement in survival among post-surgery patients, according to Blackstone, this is a reassuring result for people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"This is where this work is critical because it states that surgery is safer in the lower BMI group," without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone also argues that people and their doctors should start taking weight really seriously after a patient’s BMI drops between 27 and 30.
“I think we’re waiting too long for people to see the seriousness of the situation,” he says.
I think that once you accumulate these genetic changes that connect their bodies firmly with obesity and diabetes, the way back is already really hard.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is not able to accommodate all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for an end to the violence in the home countries of refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is devoted to the study of ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He argued that under the current circumstances, the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries, however admirable, to the refugee crisis was inadequate in this situation.
“It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria to resolve the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"Caring for several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you will have to think about a long-term solution to bring real peace and real development, especially through the education of these Muslim countries," he said.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce the killings in their countries.
We need to limit the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
Addressing the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also spoke about the allegations against George Bush after the 9/11 terrorist attack, claiming that “the violent reaction of the US has triggered a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my sincere condolences in a letter to President Bush and advised him that the way to solve this problem was not a violent one.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and created unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have taken a sanitary product in the last 4 years
Toxicology centers around the United States have reported a nearly 400 percent increase since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who ingested a high-alcohol sanitation agent, according to the Toxicology Center in Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Toxicology Center, the number of sanitary supplies in children under the age of 12 who were reported to poison control centers increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children get to these products more often and unfortunately there is a percentage of children who need to be taken to the emergency room,” Lopez told CNN.
Some children drink sanitation on purpose, while some want to impress their friends or as a challenge on social media.
Videos on YouTube show teens drinking sanitation because of the low-cost noise.
The teenagers allegedly mixed a sanitary product with mouthwash containing alcohol for a stronger drink.
Younger children can be attracted to the attractive smell of the remedy.
"The children don't think it could hurt them," Lopez said.
A lot of the more attractive (sanitary) means are those that are perfumed.
To dispose are sanitary products with the smell of strawberries, grapefruit or oranges, which are very attractive for children.
The sanitary product contains between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, several curls can mean alcohol poisoning.
"It's a highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, director of the University of Kansas Toxicology Control Center at Fox 4 in Kansas City.
You wouldn’t just let a glass of whiskey roll, but people leave these sanitation supplies outside, and when children get to them, it’s a quick way to consume alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed up to four ounces of strawberry-scented sanitary napkin at school and was taken away for emergency treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is double the threshold considered drunkenness in an adult, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who took care of her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah uttered vague words and was unable to walk after she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors were monitoring her overnight in a separate children's hospital for any signs of brain trauma because the girl fell and hit her head because of alcohol, Ritchey said.
"It was very scary," Nhaijah's mother, Ortoria Scott, told CNN.
It could have been fatal to my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or arrange for sanitation to be within the reach of children.
Apart from alcohol poisoning, some sanitation was associated with death.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing a sanitary device that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Healthcare professionals believed that the product contains methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethanol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-year students in northern New York planned to poison their “evil” teacher by distributing antibacterial products around the room,” according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to sanitary ware and banned their presence in the room.
The police deemed the messed-up plan an "innocent bragging," and referred to the school district's discipline,
Fama: No discrepancies in the Celtic team
Griffiths downplays the talk of Celtic disagreement, while Deila admits the Hoops are in the wrong place, but he reverses it again.
The Hearts will fight the SFA against the attack on Neilson, and Warburton is worried that the new reinforcements from January will disrupt the unity of the team.
Dons increase their lead over Celtic by 5 points
The first-half penalty from Adam Rooney secured Aberdeen a close victory over Hamilton at Pittodria, giving the Dons a five-point lead between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths Denies Talk of Disharmony
This situation has sparked rumours of mismatches in Celtic, which have been denied by Griffiths, who insists that he and his teammates are not working under any pressure from increased supervision in preparation for a match with the leaders of the Dutch league.
"I don't think we're under any pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
Deficiency in Scottish title rivalry bores the Netherlands - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national teamman Ronald de Boer says Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because there is no longer any rivalry between them over the title.
De Boer, who is currently Ajax's ambassador, said: "In the Netherlands they no longer show the best of Celtic matches, and why?"
Because the Rangers aren't there anymore.
The people here aren't just talking about the Rangers coming back.
He's talking about the old company.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There is a lot of tension in the Old Company matches and not only people from Scotland are watching these games.
I'll turn things back to the good, Deila commits.
ROONY Dealia admitted that Celtic was a little sloppy, but the Norwegian boss made a commitment to turn things around for the better.
Malm's defeat and subsequent defeat from the Champions League was quickly followed by a defeat against Aberdeen, which had only 10 players and now stands at the top of the table with a five-point lead.
But Deila says, "The Celtic has already gone through bad times and will rise again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it’s very frustrating and a lot of people are really, really upset or sad about the current situation.
We're all the same - but we have to move on.
We really, really need Celtic’s support because it makes the players a lot better.
Now it is very important to stay together.
Warburton is worried about January reinforcements
Despite comments that surfaced a few weeks ago suggesting that he had already identified some of his January targets, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is worried about a large buy-in boost and insists he doesn’t want to disrupt the Ibrox team’s unity.
Brentford’s former boss says, “The January transfer window is very different from the summer one.”
Players who come in the summer have the entire pre-season period to settle in, which you could see on our own team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes there will be more damage by adding unnecessary players to those you really need.
Celtic Mich's transfer target suggests retirement
The attacker Swansea Michu, who was linked to Celtic in the transfer window, suggested he could retire after his contract with Swansea expired.
The 20-year-old shooter has been struggling with a prone ankle for two years and has been unable to find a way out of Wales this summer.
Hearts to fight SFA over comments against Neilson
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was sent to the dressing room and eventually lost 3-2, but the red card on this defender was later cancelled - this is the third red card issued by referee Collum, which was revoked.
Neilson goes on to say, “I didn’t question integrity, I didn’t comment on performance.”
Griffiths pledged to avoid Tynecastle
Hard-headed Hibbe was severely reprimanded after confessing to singing a song with lyrics aimed at former Hearts player Rudolf Skacel.
The incident took place at a pub in the Roserburn area of Edinburgh before the Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was a very scary moment," the striker said, adding, "I can safely say I won't be going back to Tynecastle unless it's in Celtic's jersey."
Tannadice Council believes in Dundee United management - Donelly
Simon Donelly insists that Dundee United’s board still believes in correcting the situation with the current management of the team – but admits that the downfall on the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the boy ready for action again," Donnelly promises.
MCInnes is pleased for "ugly victory" against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team had to hold on desperately to the Hamilton Accies to win the seventh consecutive league victory and a five-point lead over Celtic at the top of the table thanks to a first-half penalty from Adam Rooney.
McInnes says, “There is no team that has won anything, be it cups or leagues, without winning this type of game.”
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged, while overall UK unemployment rises
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged at 164,000 between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the UK rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
The Scottish unemployment rate was 5.9 per cent above that in the UK (5.5 per cent), according to data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland has fallen by 12,000 over a three-month period, with the number of workers now stalling at 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0% over the quarter, which is above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
Scotland’s Secretary of State David Mundell said in a comment to the latest data: “The long-term government plan laid the foundations for a stronger economy.”
It is almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain a part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the labour market and Scottish employment has grown while unemployment has fallen.
Why I Witnessed the Execution in Oklahoma
Later today, despite the late legal intervention, I will be watching the man's execution.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll be sitting in a viewing gallery in the death chamber of Oklahoma State Prison, and I'll see Richard Glossip executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four officials who will witness his death.
I first received the invitation in January through my best friend and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As that day approaches, I'm starting to get scared.
Then why am I doing this?
I accepted this invitation because I think it's a good way for me to tell you the whole story of the death penalty.
It would give me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to watch executions in America, and since there are often more applications than there are vacancies, a morbid lottery is held to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma reduced the number of places for journalists from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will watch the entire execution uninterestedly.
I can't do that.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip’s closest friends, and I have created a special bond with him through months of phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like that kid.
We often laugh when we talk to each other.
The prison administration says I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won't be allowed a notepad and I won't be able to record what I see.
I'll just have to remember all the details.
A reporter from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner the way he likes it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that "she could have formulated it better," but she still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist who will be ready to tell the story on the spot.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help the proceedings against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a journalist from the Huffington Post, will be by my side.
To learn more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I have created.
I'm not going to repeat all the details here.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Trees would have made him guilty of complicity in the crime.
But I believe there's a good chance he's innocent of murder.
I firmly believe that not enough evidence has been provided to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, execution is bad.
And it is from this perspective that I will watch his death.
I can't say I'll be really objective.
For this purpose, you can contact other journalists.
What you get from me is the experience of seeing a person I love die a useless death.
Man escapes from Canning River after police chase
Officer Canning Vale remained dry after he cleared the men from the Canning River.
The bet of the man from Peter that he would run away from the police did not come out after he had gotten into the shallow muddy water just meters from the policeman, who tried to force him to return to the shore.
Police from Canning Vale were summoned in an incident exceeding Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to get rid of them by escaping across the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"He stood in the water and said, 'I'm not going out, just come for me,'" Sgt. Shandell Castledine said.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec did not want to soak his uniform, so he tried to use a safer tactic, namely police negotiation.
"People sometimes try to do funny things on the run," Castledine said.
Football champion Ben Cousins gives a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove into a ditch to avoid the bus and tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were futile, but he inspired the locals to start planning Ben Cousins' biathlon.
Peter Moody says organizers tried to spy on him and threatens to end races
Peeter Moody accused Racing Victoria of trying to get a spy into his stable last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He focused on the organizers and integrity department of Racing Victoria and was convinced that they had a personal campaign against him with late scratching Lady Tatai during maintenance on the day of the race, which was his last drop on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he’s always tried to do what’s best for the race and found himself in a difficult situation when it comes to Lidarin positive for cobalt, which he can’t explain.
He bit his tongue on espionage charges for 18 months and didn't want it to look like "dry grapes."
"I didn't mean to say anything about sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it all comes out of you all at once," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I'm going to have to live with what I said.
I'll go home today and get a good night's sleep.
I want to walk with my head up and let the owners think that I'm doing my best for them.
If they start to think otherwise, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I would have to consider what I would do with my license.
Earlier, Moody released a bomb in his interview with racing.com that the integrity department tried to spy on him.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in the room with a man - whom I'm going to name after the question - and offered him a job in my stables for finding out about the things that are being done in my stables," Moody told Racing.com.
Of course they thought I was a fraud.
If that's the case, they should all show their information, because in an attempt to catch me, they've completely burned me.
Robert Roulston, former RVL Chairman, David Moodie, current RVL Chairman, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware of this at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I think it's going to be a personal matter?
Will RVL allow a few balls to grow and arrange for people outside the coaching position to take responsibility for what is happening in this industry?
Am I bad for this industry?
Am I really that bad for this industry?
Maybe the people here think so.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me away and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now will give them the material to think about.
But I got to the point where I don't care anymore, and I'm sad about it.
I'm really upset.
I will push them and carry the burden on them to make decisions.
I have the support of my family and I can leave.
The coach’s frustration levels have risen with long-term investigations into cobalt including Lidari and a recent scratch in it has aroused the feeling that he “could clock his license to the table.”
Mood, best known for preparing the undefeated champion Black Caviar, called the treatment rule on the day of the race "ridiculous" after a clay plaster or mud was applied to the horse's feet, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of the race.
I have to take full responsibility for it," he said.
Someone on my team accidentally put mud on his foot.
He could have had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday and it could have happened too.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody faced a three-month disqualification for treating tiles on the day of the race, to which the organizers had already opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
The Cobra driver who escaped was arrested.
Police arrested a man who hit a cyclist in Cobra over the weekend and left after a collision.
The cyclist was airlifted to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by cars on the main Murray Valley road on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver left without stopping and helping the injured rider.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia confessed to police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with non-stop accidents, non-provision of assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobra, remains in hospital in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy strikes back at rivals over wrestling claims
Craig Bellamy, the Melbourne Storm coach, criticized his players' interventions as "setting a plan" for two NRL favorites in the premiership.
Trent Robinson, coach of the Sydney Roosters, said the referees allowed Storm players to "wrestle" his players during Storm's controversial victory in the Sydney Qualifying Final on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, coach of the Brisbane Broncos, made a slightly covert remark on the Strom after his team won the qualifiers over the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, calling the game a "show" of the rugby league and saying two of Queensland were not "too big".
Bellamy defended his players' interventions and said that during them they focused on "contact."
Bellamy added that the situation had boosted his self-confidence because his team was criticized by two top coaches, which may mean they are afraid of being defeated by the Storm team.
"It's still coming - I don't remember Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when we were beaten 24-2," he said.
I can guarantee that in the last year we have not changed anything from our defensive system and techniques, in the last weeks we have only emphasized contact during the procedures, and this has meant a turnaround for us.
Trent has been here for three years and obviously coaching a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, which could have been a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how things like that always come into this part of the year.
Bellamy dismissed Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons team won the 2010 premiership by playing "boring" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He was right that his Saturday game was just as exciting as ours, and just as exciting," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010, St George was criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he didn't care.
But now he has a team that can play the style of the game that seems repulsive to him, especially his young backers with their speed.
That’s the kind of football you would want to play if you had this type of player available.
He said this in 2010 and now wants all teams to play his style of football – but not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can’t play that style.
It gives me more self-confidence because they say things like that, because they are worried about the fight against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't even think about us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that more goals were scored in Storm and Roosters than in the Broncos and Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos team was probably good, I did not watch, but what is the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is it exciting football?
Or are breaks and non-scoring experiments interesting?
I think it's agendas.
If they mention us, it means that we will meet again at a certain stage.
Storm have a break this weekend and won the right to host either the North Queensland Cownboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary final next Saturday night at AAMI Park. Tickets will be on sale from the morning of next Tuesday.
Serbian man gets $200,000 bail on drug charges
A man who faced a possible life sentence for possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled from Queensland was given a $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month by federal police in search of 100 kilograms of drugs from the Solay yacht, which arrived from South America via Vanuatu and anchored in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was spotted meeting the accused at the port during the morning and later met them at the Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kilograms of drugs in the Toyota Echo.
Despite facing a potential life sentence for possession of commercial-grade cocaine, Maksimovic’s lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he owned the entire quantity and that he could have been in the cafe entirely by accident and innocent.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan believed that Maksimovic would have escaped.
It has a clear connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in court on Wednesday.
In the crown case, he lied to the police about where he lived.
Maksimovic’s mother and stepfather offered a $200,000 bail for his release.
“After reading the sworn statements of both parties, it is clear that the deposit of $200,000 is a real financial burden for them,” Flanagan said.
Their efforts alone were obviously insufficient, because the accused did not go to court further, he warned.
Maksimovic was granted bail on the condition that he surrenders both an Australian and a Serbian passport, will report to the police every day and will comply with a ban on leaving from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used a girl’s phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures
The pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to obtain photos of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg picked up the girl’s phone while she was sleeping, then signed up for her online chat, where he had a lot of rude photos of children sent to him by another user.
The girl then woke up and found that her phone was missing, and then found it in the hand of a sleeping Hogg.
She went through it, and before she alerted her mother, she found disturbing news.
Police got involved and saw five photos, then the analytic computers found the address and found "concerning" searches on the web using terms to search for immoral images of children.
Hogg then told police that his reason was to "lead pedophiles" on the internet before he would "pretend to be a police officer and intimidate them."
Fiscal representative Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it's addiction - it's addictive to scaring people.
He admitted that the computer search was done by him, but claimed that he only wanted to pretend to be a policeman to scare away pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted to send more.
According to him, he did it to lure them
He says he jumped in drunkenness and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "When the girl found the messages on her phone, he called her mother, she shook and cried.
She saw immoral images on her phone and the defendant was then confronted.
The girl was interrogated and talked about how the defendant used her computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hog, 23, a resident of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to a charge of accepting or providing inappropriate pictures of children on June 14 of last year, violated bail conditions on January 25, and did not appear in court on March 24 of this year.
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim has asked Hogg not to be placed on the sex offenders list because he can argue that there was "no fundamental sexual subtext" in his act.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the verdict to October for filing reports of social workers.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was held in custody before being heard about other unresolved cases.
He was placed on the sex offenders list before the date of his conviction.
Zimbabwean Robert Mugabe makes a bad speech in parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa’s oldest leader, fell on the stairs leading to the stage earlier this year.
He was not injured, but the video of his fall went viral on social media.
The opening of parliament was also tainted by claims by opposition lawmakers that they received anonymous threats of killing, which warned them against exposing Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, he was scolded and provoked during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The chairman of the Democratic Change Movement (MDC) parliamentary club, Innocent Gonese, said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones with a warning not to impede Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The report comes from a number that will not appear, but is called 'death,'" he told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
It warns members concerned to know that immunity ends in parliament and once they leave parliament, their parliamentary immunity does not work.
The head said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, had "concerns" about threats to MPs.
Hewlett-Packard plans to reduce the number of jobs by up to 30,000.
Hewlett-Packard canceled 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its efforts to restructure and save the company’s business services costs.
HP will split into two publicly traded companies later this year, separating the PC and printer business from its faster-growing corporate hardware and services operations.
The expected reduction in the number of jobs will result in a change in the range of about $2.7 billion and will begin in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
“These restructuring activities will enable us to create a more competitive, cost-sustainable structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, HP’s CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors, who will lead the unit after the split.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than HP today and will have a broad and extensive portfolio of stores to help businesses transition to a new style of business,” Whitman said.
As a separate company, we will be in a much better position to meet the evolving requirements of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Parckard Enterprise will have an annual revenue of more than $50 billion and will “focus on delivering unrivalled integrated technology solutions” to companies.
The company was founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, who produced electrical equipment and whose Palo Alto garage was dubbed the "Silicon Valley playground."
HP has undergone a massive reorganization to handle the move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest tech companies in America, is the latest in this sector based on the belief that a narrowly specialized company has better results.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must get behind injured Jack Wilshere ahead of Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also stressed to Wilshere that it is still only September and, if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason not to play again at Christmas.
This best-case scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least four more English games and, from a historical perspective, his involvement in the next European Summer Championship is obviously uncertain.
The great pity of this latest problem is that Wilshere ended last season strong after an ankle injury and then got back into former form during the pre-season.
“This kind of injury doesn’t endanger a career,” Wenger says.
It is a wound that requires healing.
It's nothing special.
It was just an accident.
It wasn't about his ankles or the injury he had suffered before.
This could be true from a purely medical point of view, as Wenger has admitted that there is a relative risk of further injury whenever any player returns during the season.
There is also an unpleasant formula here.
A survey conducted by Premier Injuries Ltd. records 23 different injuries to Wilshere since he made his gaming debut six years ago.
Over the past five years, he has played only in 65 Arsenal league matches out of a total of 157:
From a broader perspective for Arsenal this means that in six of the eight seasons since 2007-08 he was one of two Premier League clubs that lost the most days due to injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of the vicious circle, but Arsenal believes the improvement in the area of injuries recorded during the last season will continue.
"Sometimes when you come back after an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain competition," Wenger says.
Jack's young enough to get out of it.
I hope his body is stabilizing, I'm sure he will, and he will have the career he deserves.
Arsenal starts the Champions League campaign on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.
Hector Beller<0xC3><0xAD>n and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debucha and Arteta are likely to join.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep my balance and let the players who need it breathe out," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear favourite to progress from Group F, Maksimir in Zagreb has a reputation as the most intimidating stadium in Europe.
Dinamo were also not defeated in a total of 41 games after last season's "invincible" campaign.
On Wednesday night, the stadium was shaken by a 3.2 degree Richter earthquake.
This was the 15th time in Zagreb this year.
Wenger thinks Arsenal have learned from last season's Champions League capitulation against Monaco and has a distant hope that he will lead the club to their first European Cup win.
"This deployment is huge," Wenger says.
It never happened to Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand I have to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friendship
The absence of similar appearances in different shows is eye-popping, especially given how men need to open up more desperately than ever when it comes to suicides among young men under the age of 15.
In 2013, it was the single largest cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address this problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) has designated 2015 as the Year of the Man, whose goal is to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when needed.
At the heart of this struggle lies the friendship to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students showing symptoms of depression found that if the injured had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a “healthy mood,” their chances of recovery doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends represents a half chance of having mental problems.
But in order for friendship to work, it must, of course, be achievable first.
In this communication through social media with an emphasis on style and not on the content of the message, the immediate response is often preferred to meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives, our need to look stronger, more fun loving and more successful has doubled, even though in reality we are more isolated.
This superficial success is controlled by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of our real values — our personal desire for growth and friendship — which have a profound impact on our mental health.
And as one billionaire and game creator recently explained, money really doesn’t buy more happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was the source of this idea for him.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but by their personalities who shone through friendly interaction.
Joey's humor and Chandler's frequent victims, moments of watching football in comfortable chairs, Ross's desire for Rachel, all stem from the knowledge that yes, men can also identify with it, even though they usually keep their feelings to themselves.
As one Samaritan worker explained to me: “My role as a listener to people who feel depressed or have suicidal tendencies really confirmed to me that even the smallest friendly interactions can make a difference.”
Men who contact us often feel the inability to communicate with friends.
The old saying "to deal with it" is strong in the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up about problems.
Friends are one of the shows that will come to my mind when I try to offer a longer-term equalization mechanism.
It emphasizes small moments in male friendship.
As for my task, the status of the outsider on the phone helps people in moments of despair, but long-term support must come from closer, from a network of friends and family.
So if this weekend you are going to the FrendsFest organized by Comedy Central station, why not take your friends for a glass to Central Perk, where the interior for the occasion of the celebration will be completely reworked.
Or when you see someone alone at Starbucks, smile at them and say hello.
You never know what a difference your friendship can make.
The Friends series will be broadcast on Comedy Central from start to finish - 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scored and helped PSG throw Malmo away
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blais Matuid and Edinson Cavani after shooting a goal against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria scored in his Champions League debut and helped PSG beat Sweden's Malmo on Tuesday.
Here is the game report and response to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored in Tuesday’s match and Paris Saint-Germain started their Champions League journey with a final comfortable 2-0 win over Malmö at the Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored the goal less than four minutes after his Champions League debut, and this PSG player sent the French champions to victory, but then threw out a few chances until they finally increased their lead when Cavani scored the goal with his head in the 61st minute.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in Group A, which is why the Paris team needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, as they focus not only on qualifying for the qualifying rounds, but on improving their path to the quarterfinals, which they recorded in each of the previous 3 years.
But even though they scored three points, it was not the classic performance of the team of Laurent Blanca and Zlatan Ibrahimovic was wasted in front of the goal and was later substituted against his home team and club, where he began his famous career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win the Champions League at home and away, so winning 2-0 makes our opponents in trouble and looking comfortable in the defense is a good start, even though there are things that we will have to improve with the progress of the season," Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, but I regret that we didn’t score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after injury as one of three changes to the PSG team that held a 2-2 draw at home this weekend with Bordeaux in Ligue 1, but was overshadowed by Di Mario in the fourth minute.
The Argentinian wing has been branded as a man who takes PSG in Europe to a new level after the move from Manchester United last month and showed why, when he ran for the pass of Marc Verratti to defend Malm and with a beautiful finish, he sent the ball behind Johan Wiland to the far corner of the goal.
However, if anyone expected it to trigger a grand victory for PSG, he had to be disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in the playoffs and made it to this stage, started with 9 internationals in the base line-up and five defenders and two drawn backers were a tough opponent.
But in addition to the Nikola Djurdjice shot, which just passed the distant corner of Kevin Trapp's goal in the 34th minute, they did not offer much in the attack.
Instead, PSG took advantage of the attack with bad touchdowns and a poor finish, which was not good even from Ibrahimovic, who could not shoot even five times in the first half, and was then disappointed because his shot came to the net shortly after the start of the second half.
However, it turned out to be much more appropriate when it came to preparing opportunities for his team-mates, and it was from his play that Di Maria sent a spinning shot that ended up in Wiland's goal after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after an hour of play thanks to Cavani, this Uruguayan sent a header for the sixth goal of this season after Ibrahimovic played him from the left wing of Maxwell.
This put an end to all Malm's thoughts about the possibility that they could gain something from the match, and only Wiland's excellent intervention from a great distance thwarted the hopes of David Luis and the score remained unchanged even when the goalkeeper Ezequiel Lavezzi was at the end of the match.
Team coach Malmo Age Hareide later admitted that PSG were a class higher than his team, Nor said: "Our last game in the Champions League took place in December last year."
Since then, we have played only the Swedish league, which is not on the same level.
Qualifying matches are not enough.
Hats off to Paris.
It was an amazing match for them.
Glencore Earns $2.5 Billion in Share Sales
Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, which was hit by a collapse in commodity prices, earned $2.5 billion from the sale of shares on Wednesday as part of its extensive debt-reduction plan.
Glencore said in a statement that it had sold new shares worth about <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion to pay off its debt.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is facing commodity price declines as China’s slowing economy lowers demand and ignites sparks of destruction across markets.
The rights issue sent the price of Glencore shares to the top of the London stock market in early morning trades on Wednesday.
Shares jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore revealed last week that the sale of $2.5 billion worth of shares is part of broader plans to reduce their $30 billion debt, which has accumulated by about a third.
The company sold new shares at a price of 123 pence per share, which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
This eliminated 1.3 billion shares at a total price of 9.99 percent per group.
Concerns over the prolongation of China’s growth slowed the price of iron ore by almost half and coal, copper and other commodities fell by 20 to 40 percent.
White House Confirms Washington Visited Xi Jinping
Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the United States at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in its report on Tuesday.
President Xi’s first visit to Washington will take place on September 25 in response to Barack Obama’s visit to Beijing, where he visited in November, the report said.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will invite President Xi and his son-in-law Peng Liyuan to a state dinner after the talks are over.
“President Xi’s visit represents an opportunity to strengthen mutual relations between the United States and China and encourages cooperation in addressing issues of international, regional and common interest and is an opportunity for a constructive debate on the differences between the two states,” the report added.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, is scheduled to visit Seattle, where he will meet with several U.S. technical leaders on his way to Washington, and then continue to New York for a U.N. meeting in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address controversial issues, including Washington’s concerns about China’s alleged cyber espionage and its growing aggressiveness in the waters of the South China Sea.
How the refugee crisis ravaged the Schengen area.
The German-fired emergency light did not deter the European crew, but it is already forcing the ship to change course, the French daily Le Figaro wrote.
The European Union decided on Monday to tackle the refugee problem first: it would rather systematically classify migrants and asylum-seekers as soon as they enter the old continent - especially in Greece - than to argue over the future distribution of real refugees according to quotas based on the quantities it has been given.
Six days after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker asked 25 of the EU’s 28 countries to redistribute 160,000 refugees, member states’ interior ministers changed their priorities.
Before taking care of the final destination of refugees, it is necessary first to filter those who arrive today and solve the fate of those who are already moving within the Schengen area.
"Effective management of the EU's external borders is essential for managing migration," the minister said in a text discussed in Brussels on Monday.
After the single currency crisis, the EU finds itself at risk in its next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it does not lose its determination and increases the pressure.
It restores border controls, especially with Austria, but without blocking the influx of those seeking asylum in that country.
The Central Power thus makes it clear that without it no free movement in Europe is possible.
As evidence, Austria and Slovakia joined the measure on Monday, the report said.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France are also considering this, albeit with varying intensity.
Hungary has been doing this for a long time.
These exceptional and temporary measures are admissible under the Schengen rules.
It's a domino effect, but it's also blind.
The key issue for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of mandatory entry controls in Greece, southern Italy and also in Hungary for those who have already gone inland.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German counterpart Thomas de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re discussed this intensively during a private interview with their three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is not new, but it is being implemented.
In Italy, according to unofficial statistics, two-thirds of newly arrived refugees have already been registered and identified by fingerprinting.
Budapest refuses to set up any entry point on its territory because it fears more than others that there will be camps on its shoulders where refugees will gather at its expense.
The real black hole is Greece, though.
More than 200,000 people landed on its islands near the Turkish coast this year, twice as many as recently arrived in Italy.
Most of them are real asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after going through crowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge gaping hole.
Athens, which is still in financial disarray and is waiting for a new government, have put their hands to their knees.
This is the starting point for the Balkan journey and now a source of common concern for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n.
The Juncker Commission has promised to put in place checkpoints as soon as possible, but has not given a number or a date.
"The challenges facing Greece are facing the whole of Europe," the EU's interior ministers agreed on Monday to mobilise on this front.
It is therefore a question of deploying the intervention teams of the European Border Control Agency Frontex in this country.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its capacity to receive asylum seekers and strengthen its surveillance of the islands.
"Adequate financial resources will be needed," the text warned to ministers for approval.
From the point of view of law, they will continue to have the last word of Athens.
The question of the creation of real European border guards has not been officially raised, but Europe is approaching it.
The new emergency of the twenty-eight has put the question of binding quotas and 160,000 refugees, which was raised at the beginning of the year by the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament and which was strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande, into the second round.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear about it.
They see it as an attack on their sovereignty.
The number, not the obligation, was retained on Monday in a text approved by the majority of the twenty-eight.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only firm promise is the redistribution of 40,000 refugees over the next two years, which was already agreed in June during the hectic EU summit, Le Figaro concludes.
Seven dead under the avalanche in the Alps, including three Czechs.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among seven tourists killed by an avalanche in the French Alps.
According to the German authorities, she is also a woman who, as the only one of the affected eight-member group, survived.
Previous media reports said it was a Pole.
A 30-year-old woman was hospitalized in the town of Briancon with a serious leg injury in the thigh area.
The dead were mostly 40-year-olds, according to AFP.
"The rescue operation is over, and the bodies of the victims have also been transferred to Briancon for identification," said Pierre Besnard, prefect of the Hautes-Alpes department.
The accident occurred around noon in the Pelvoux mountainous region under the summit of the D<0xC3><0xB4>me de Neige des Ecrins measuring 4015 meters.
"The long avalanche was 250 meters wide and about a meter high," rescue chief Nicolas Colombani said.
In the eight-member group, he said, there was a huge amount of snow at an altitude of about 3,900 meters.
The Meteorological Service did not warn the area of bad weather today.
Trpi<0xC5><0xA1>ovsk<0xC3><0xBD> before the match with Braga: Finally true Europe.
Coach Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Trpi<0xC5><0xA1>ovsk<0xC3><0xBD> was able to pass through the European League preliminary rounds with the Liberec players to the base group during his premiere in the cup and now he is looking forward to enjoying the real Europe with the team.
Slav at the start of the main stage of the competition welcomes the finalist from 2011 Braga and according to the coach he wants to impose his playing style on her.
After all the nerves in knockout fights, where every goal and every situation could have knocked you out on your way to a dream group, now we're there and we're going to play six matches.
Of course we want to win, but we do not have to be afraid of every goal, we can play our own tactics and we are not tied by just a doubles match.
"I'm really looking forward to it and it's a real Europe, before that it was just a qualification," Trpi<0xC5><0xA1>ovsk<0xC3><0xBD> told a press conference.
Braga is considered a top team.
He will be very active, they have the same Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good at the ball.
The opponent may be even more difficult because he doesn’t have that name, but he has a player in his squad who gave Manchester City three goals.
"It's an excellent whole at the top team level," Trpi<0xC5><0xA1>ovsk<0xC3><0xBD> said.
But he doesn't consider Braga a clear favorite.
I take it that we play at home, so we're definitely not outsiders.
"I think we have shown that we are strong in our stadium, both in the domestic competition and in the forecourt, and we want to confirm that," said the coach, whose team lost from eleven duels this season only the opening Super Cup in Pilsen.
He believes that Liberec and Braze can impose their style.
We have a team that will be strong on the ball, at the same time it is atypically disciplined for them.
They play from a 4-4-2 disassembly with a quick transition to the attacking phase.
"It's a very difficult opponent, we have discovered weaknesses, but the most important thing will be how our players do it on the pitch," Trpi<0xC5><0xA1>ovsk<0xC3><0xBD> said.
We studied a lot of opponents in the forecourts, which helped us a lot, this time we want to focus on our game, which we also adapted the training.
"And we definitely want, even if it's going to be very challenging, to be played according to our notes," the coach added.
The student films dominate the Sand, the international festival begins.
More than 350 authors from 51 countries have submitted their works to the 15th edition of the International Festival of Student Films in Sand this year.
Four dozen of them, which the commission consisting of students and teachers sent to the final, will be screened from 15 to 18 October in the cinema Porty<0xC4><0x8D>.
The best of them will be chosen by the international jury, said festival spokesman Jakub Charv<0xC3><0xA1>t.
Each year the festival has its own special theme, which derives from the festival slogan.
She's a detective this year.
The director of this year’s festive evenings Richard Blumenfeld plans to combine elements of television, film and theatre productions.
"And, of course, we also have to solve the crime that was committed in our whistleblower this year," Charv<0xC3><0xA1>t said.
Visitors will see a selection of the most interesting of student creations - films played, animated and documentary.
It will be judged by an international jury, which will include last year’s winner, director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Sharda.
As every year, the organizers of the festival prepare an accompanying program.
Wattican Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Ruml, professional didgeridoo player Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Smeykal, turbochanson group Fly?, playing band Zrn<0xC3><0xAD> or for example Petra Hapkov<0xC3><0xA1> with the recital Life at the bar.
The festival will also host two photo exhibitions.
The first will be brought by the graduate of the Sand Film School and the winner of prestigious awards, among which there is also a World Press Photo 2014, Jana Asenbrenner.
The second exhibition will bring closer to the atmosphere that prevailed in Nepal after the tragic earthquake.
The silent film The Cameraman is accompanied by Gerhard Gruber with his music and the puppet natives Brukner, Novotn<0xC3><0xBD> and Hlach in the studio of the sculptor Jan Novotn<0xC3><0xBD> will baptize his new book 3 friends from the city of P.
This year we also remember Miroslav Ond<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek, patron of FAMO in P<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xA1>ek, who recently left us.
Our school and the festival are his legacy, which will live on.
"Young people from all over the world will continue to meet here, exchange experiences with each other, and develop joint ties and filmmaking," the spokesperson said.
The Pitching forum will certainly help, where students can meet film professionals, take several job interviews at once and thus gain a job position.
The festival is associated with the creation of the Private Higher Professional Film School in P<0xC3><0xAD>sek.
Its founders, husbands Vladana and Milo<0xC5><0x88> Ter<0xC4><0x8D>, organized the first year in 1997.
By the sixth year, it was held once every two years.
In the event of the bankruptcy of CK, the insurance companies have to pay the claims of the clients in full.
Insurance companies should pay the claims of clients in the event of the insolvency of the travel agency in full.
The House decided on this on Wednesday, when it approved a revised amendment to the law on the conditions of business in tourism.
Travel agencies will be able, according to the draft, which is intended for consideration in the Senate, to replace bankruptcy insurance with a bank guarantee.
Insurance companies with the obligation to pay the claims of clients even above the agreed limit do not agree.
The Ministry of Local Development is in the process of adjusting, arguing for consumer protection.
Insurance companies have already threatened to stop insuring travel agencies against bankruptcy if the amendment pays off.
The proposal is also criticised by travel agencies.
Without insurance, they will either have to leave or go abroad.
Minister for Local Development Karla <0xC5><0xA0>lechtov<0xC3><0xA1> (for ANO) pointed out that cases where insurance companies did not pay full compensation are not euro-compliant.
She noted this year’s decision of the Constitutional Court, which confirmed that the client is entitled to a full refund regardless of the limit of insurance.
Insurance companies will receive sufficient information about the management of travel agencies and will be able to determine the correct limit, <0xC5><0xA0>lechtov<0xC3><0xA1> stressed.
"We appreciate the effort to increase consumer protection, but it must have such a limit to be feasible," said Miroslav Kalousek, Vice-President of TOP 09.
According to him, the bank guarantee will not work, because no one gives it unlimited.
"The travel agencies will have to stop their activities or move abroad," Kalousek warned.
A member of the board of the Association of Czech Travel Agents and Agencies Tomio Okamura (SPD) disagreed with Kalousk's concerns on the basis of a survey among members of the CK.
"Stop showing us lobbying insurance companies," he said.
Okamura does not consider the statements of insurance companies to be relevant, no official written statement in this sense in its opinion does not exist.
They are, however, finding out whether the travel agencies will participate, which according to Okamura is not a problem.
Jana Fischer (ODS), who referred to the opinion of the Competitive Association of Travel Offices of the Czech Republic, and her party colleague Petr Bendl, who spoke about the eradication of stairs by Czech travel agencies, also warned of the provision.
According to Fischer, travel agencies will not be able to negotiate insurance.
"Consumer protection works," Fischer said.
The House did not approve of her proposal to release the controversial passage.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Filip (KS<0xC4><0x8C>M) did not come forward with a proposal to return the proposal to the committee because of the alleged contradiction with the civil code.
Filip pointed to the travel agencies, which he said could endanger consumers.
The draft rapporteur, Martina Berdychov<0xC3><0xA1> (YES), has withdrawn her proposal to limit the liability of insurance companies in cases where they could not know that insurance coverage would not cover the entire risk.
The amendment will not initially propose a minimum insurance limit of 4 million for travel agencies offering air travel, and a million limit for offices selling, for example, bus trips.
The limit will remain at 30 percent of planned sales from the sale of tours.
However, the limit of insurance coverage will have to be such that in the event of the bankruptcy of the travel agency, it will cover all the claims of customers.
Even after the changes, the norm stipulates that travel agencies will have to re-state which travel agency organizes the trip for the sold trips.
Travel agencies will have to submit to the insurance companies before the conclusion of the contract, among other things, information about the management and number of trips.
The approved amendment of the Public Administration Committee also envisages further regular information to insurance companies.
Travel agencies will have to provide them with monthly data on the number of passengers and trips sold, the total price of trips sold, and the amount of advances and sales for trips and vouchers.
If the Ministry of Local Development finds that the travel agency has failed to comply with any of the legal obligations towards the insurance company, it will invite it to rectify the draft or may prohibit it from entering into new contracts in the event that the breach of the obligation could endanger the interests of the customers.
The amendment also aims to amend the financing of mountain services.
The Ministry of Local Development will determine the amount of the subsidy to the mountain service on the basis of its request, which will always be submitted by the end of April for the next year.
The application will include a report on the use of state money in the past year, a financial spending plan and a outlook for the next two years.
According to the association, the proponent of the law did not think of the situation, however, what will happen if the insurance company terminates the CK contract.
It will not be able to organize trips and clients who bought the trip before the termination of insurance, so it will be lost according to the association.
In such a case, CK will suffer a significant loss and may even fail even though its management was in good condition.
One of the ways in which travel agencies can cope with such a situation will be to sue the state for compensation.
Another option will be to go abroad and use much softer conditions abroad and then in our market we will act only as agencies, said Jan Pape<0xC5><0xBE>, vice-president of the association.
According to him, the proposal of the amendment also includes a bank guarantee institution, but so inconsiderate that it cannot be implemented in practice at all, because the bank guarantee cannot sound like an unlimited amount.
Moreover, according to the association, a change in current practice is de facto unnecessary.
Within two years, the whole law will have to be reworked in view of the new EU directive.
There are now a total of 942 active insured travel agencies operating on the Czech market.
This year, only three CKs have ceased operations.
Domestic travel agencies sell trips worth around CZK 20 billion per year.
Merkel: We need to improve conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must commit itself to improving humanitarian conditions in the refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon in order to limit the arrival of refugees in Europe.
This was announced by German Chancellor Angela Merkel after talks with the German country's prime ministers.
At the same time, it reiterated its call for the distribution of refugees who have already arrived in the EU among the member states of the twenty-eight.
We need to do more to help countries where refugees leave or where they stay after they leave their homeland.
I expect a signal from the European Union that we will build on dignified conditions in refugee camps, for example in Jordan and Lebanon, said the German Chancellor, according to which such a signal could also be greater financial assistance or closer cooperation between the EU and international humanitarian organisations.
"The federal states also support the German government in promoting a fair distribution of the weight of the refugee crisis to European countries," Merkel said.
The Prime Minister of Brandenburg, Dietmar Woidke, said at a press conference that he expects real solidarity from all EU states.
The distribution of refugees in the EU on the basis of quotas has long been rejected by the Czech Republic, among other things.
Merkel and Woidke also advocated speeding up asylum procedures in Germany.
People need to know as soon as possible if they have a chance to stay here.
It is also necessary for the authorities to be able to start the integration of foreigners faster, said the Prime Minister of Branibor.
He also said that most of the money that Germany spends on the care of refugees should be used to integrate those who have a chance of obtaining asylum.
More teachers will be needed in order for the refugees to master German.
It is a big challenge for our country, but I believe that if refugees are able to integrate, they can be of benefit to us, he said.
Matt Damon squanders diversity in the film
Matt Damon confronted Afroametic filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion of diversity with the claim that it was not necessary behind the scenes.
During the Sunday episode of HBO's Greenlight project, the actor in the series was interrupted by Brown, stressing the need for alternative views on the black protagonists in the script.
“When we talk about diversity, you do it by casting a movie, not by casting a show,” Damon says.
Shocked, Brown reacted with distrust and sighed, "Hoo! Wow. Okay," when the comments about Martian were broadcast.
Damon and Brown teamed up with well-known producer Ben Affleck and the Farrell brothers to discuss the show's finalists.
“I’d like to appeal to people to think, whoever the director is, how they’re going to treat Harmony’s character,” Brown said.
The only black character that is a whore that is packed by a white dog.
The producer of Dear White People promoted the finalists Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the rights to direct the film; Damon cut off that their directors "could eventually give us something we don't want."
After the discussion aired, social media exploded in disagreement with Damon’s comment.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at writing the clip, “Matt Damon jumped into the speech of the only black woman in the room, so he can explain to her that diversity is SO WHITE that it even hurts.”
Twitter has gained more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since it was published.
Damon’s comment comes at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After a teenage Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained national influence and pushed lawmakers and authorities to refrain from discriminatory practices against colored people.
In February, Prince made references to the movement while quoting the Album of the Year nominees during the Grammy Awards.
"Albums are still important," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.
The latest leader of the Black Lives Matter movement released a statement in response to a question from Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," the executive said.
Damon was recently listed on a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls who were invited to visit the pope to discuss depicting the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or had already met the pope is unclear.
"American Ninja Warrior has its first winner."
Professional climber Isaac Caldiero became the first contestant to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday and take home $1 million.
In the competition, which just ended its seventh season, none of the competitors managed to overcome all the obstacles on the track.
During the final of this season, two men fought through to the final round, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten.
The last obstacle was a 30-second climb over more than 220 m of rope.
Britten was the first to climb the ladder within a set limit, becoming the first contestant to cross an intensifying 4 stretch in the American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero surpassed it by a full three seconds and won the competition.
Caldiero gave an interview for E! News immediately after his hard-won victory and was shocked to learn that he was still winning the main prize worth $1 million.
“It’s an amazing feeling, I’ve never made more than $10,000 a year in my life,” Isaac E. said in response to his win.
"So all of a sudden... I can't even imagine what it's going to be like now."
Executive producer Kent Weed gave an interview to The Hollywood Reporter about the course of the final and why Britten won't get any rewards despite becoming the first contestant to finish the track.
As a rule, the money belongs to the person who finishes the track the fastest.
“If there are more competitors on the track, the winner will be the one with the best time,” Weed said.
Even if winning the main prize would change his life, Britten is satisfied with his performance.
“I don’t think there’s any resentment in it.
He is glad that he has achieved what he has achieved.
He received a warm welcome from the fans.
He's a great guy and he likes his family.
He is a hero to his wife and children.”
Geoff told me, “If there was to be someone who could beat me, I’m glad it was Isaac.”
And I think if I won, Isaac would feel the same way.
America Ninja Warrior will continue the eighth season, which will begin shooting in the spring of 2016.
Detroit Tigers Just Passed the Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- For Detroit tigers, the second half of the season wasn't just a walk through the pink garden.
Tigers, one of the best baseball teams, is currently in last place in the Central Division of the American League.
The Tigers only narrowly averted their defeat when they beat Minnesota 5–4 at Target Field on Tuesday.
The twins missed a chance to get closer to the Houston Astros and capture the second wild card in the American League.
Even if only for one night, for Detroit it was the return of the word to Z, which was so elusive for them during the second half of the season.
"Winning is always fun and it doesn't matter how," said Tigers manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger striker Alfredo Simon maintained his offensive line-up and Detroit scored three times in the first two shifts and then took the next in the sixth and ninth shifts.
Simon (13-9) allowed the opponents 6 1/3 kicks and 3 rounds.
It was his third successful game in the last nine games.
“I want to end this year with convincing results,” Simon said.
“It’s hard to get into a game when you’re sitting on the bench a lot and that’s why I want to get into the game.”
Tiger batsman Victor Martinez hit three times and made 2 laps and his first withdrawn point since mid-August.
For Martinez, it was the first three-point game since the last game in June, in which he hit four times in a game against the Seattle Mariners.
"He leaned pretty hard on it," Ausmus said.
"He looked good in training, he fired noticeably better and he managed to transfer it to the match."
With three laps at the end of the seventh round, the Twins had the best chance of returning to the game.
Midfielder Byron Buxton won a trade thanks to two points on the left side of the pitch.
Right-hander Aaron Hicks earned a point thanks to the set ball, and Simon struck out Brian Dozier before being replaced by left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy knocked out his only opponent, Mauer, and in front of him was Miguel San, who fired the ball and circling two goals, leaving behind right-handed Drew VerHagen.
With two players on goals and a chance of a draw in the second round, VerHagen managed to send the third over two goals.
Plouffe has already won 27 overs over two goals this season and reigns in the league table.
Detroit held their ninth shift, Mauer scored two points and Bruce Rondon secured a 5-4 score for the Tigers.
However, this right-hander knocked out Sana for three overs.
Detroit took advantage and earned points in the Phil Hughes game.
The tigers won three rounds in the first two innings against a well-earned right-hander who entered the game after more than a month's break due to back muscle inflammation.
"I certainly didn't imagine such a start," said Hughes, "but in the third round I already felt that I was getting better at pitching."
After resisting the attack in the first round, Hughes left one point to second-place finisher Ian Kinsler.
Two departures for the right-hander J.D. Martinez brought out Victor Martinez, who was the first to run all the goals.
Victor Martinez interrupted his series 0-21.
Nick Castellanos followed him with a point on the right side of the field and scored another lap, but Victor Martinez was overturned when he tried to reach the third goal.
The Tigers added in the second innings, when pitcher James McCann and pitcher Anthony Gose scored two and then one point, and the score was 3-0 on the final table.
"That got us down on our knees," Twins manager Paul Molitor said.
"He didn't hit the ball very well, but he got it in the right place."
Hughes, who won by the number of overs, finished in the third round with no points and was replaced by right-handed A.J. Achter.
Hughes scored three goals, scored six shots and four strikes.
NOTE: Anibal Sanchez, the right-handed Tigers pitcher, ended the match with pain in his right shoulder.
He will be taken care of by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the injured list due to stretched shoulder muscles since mid-August, is expected to enter Wednesday's match.
Sanchez is replaced by left-handed Daniel Norris, who returns after being injured and takes on the Twins.
Since June 30, when Norris was traded to David Price's left-hander, he has scored 1-1 after 4 games.
However, since August 20, he has not played yet because of his stretched muscle.
Tigers and Twins will play their third game at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) will face Minnesota left-back Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for the opening of the economy to the wider world
It is necessary to open the economy to the wider world to boost growth, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with Tuesday’s governance reform.
"China should engage in attracting foreign investment and expertise and improve open policies," he said of the 16th meeting of the central leadership of the group to deepen the overall reform.
Propagating openness to emerging reforms will provide a new impetus and vitality, as well as a new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The lead group adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of regulatory access to the market, the release of border controls policy, support for state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to absorb private capital and the reorganization of the registration resident system.
The declaration states that a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and undertakings that are outside investment limits.
This system will be gradually tested and improved through test programmes.
This step is important because it will give the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensuring a legal business environment and making the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also release controls on the powers it delegates to companies, and make sure that the companies themselves will decide how to run their businesses.
The statement also states that China will enable border regions to discover new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to support regional growth.
In an effort to open up a state-controlled sector, more areas will be opened up to private investment.
“The government will not change its foreign investment policy and will protect the legitimate interests of companies that are financed from abroad and will provide them with better services,” the statement said.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or a "green card", thanks to the optimization of requirements and the simplification of the application process.
Ensuring the rights of lawyers to practice and develop professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at the meeting.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang and leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended the meeting, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
In the Karlovy Vary region, a new bedding department may be established.
According to Deputy Head of the Karlovy Vary Region, Jakub P<0xC3><0xA1>nik (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), the current capacity of the bed departments of two regional hospitals and two private hospitals in the region is sufficient and partial adjustments should be made on the basis of an agreement between the departments of individual hospitals.
However, there are also opportunities to expand care in the region.
For example, in the department of surgical departments, a one-day surgery center could be established, where, according to the set concept, the performances of surgical disciplines that do not require hospitalization for more than 24 hours would be performed.
It is not yet clear in which specific hospitals the one-day surgery-focused workplace should be.
At the skin department of the Karlovy Vary hospital, a laser center could be created with the possibility of using laser technology for skin diseases.
The concept also recommended the creation of an apalic center, which would take care of patients with brain disabilities who are in a vegetative state.
Such a centre should be set up centrally and should be an integral part of the anesthesiology-resuscitation department.
There is also the possibility of concentrating such a device in the Ostrov hospital, where similar care already exists.
Another bed capacity, which appears to be insufficient in the Karlovy Vary region, is the beds of follow-up care, especially the beds of the Long-Term Care Centre (LDN), whose capacity in Nejdka is insufficient and above all should be closely related to acute care beds.
Part of this device should function as a rehabilitation bed and part as a classic LDN bed, the concept is recommended.
As he points out, the beds of follow-up care are mainly missing in the hospital of Karlovy Vary.
Abandoned buildings could be used there after centralization.
Last but not least, in the Karlovy Vary region, there are no social health beds with a focus on the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.
These beds are lacking throughout the Republic, so it could also serve other regions as the so-called Alzheimer's Center.
According to the recommendations, hospitals should also prepare for the introduction of so-called follow-up beds, on which European grant funds will be released.
"These are beds that will follow the fields of supspecialized care and will form the space for translation of patients after surgery, for example after cardiosurgical, neurosurgical, transplantation or other surgery," describes the regional concept of bed care.
New services could also be offered in the area of psychiatric care.
