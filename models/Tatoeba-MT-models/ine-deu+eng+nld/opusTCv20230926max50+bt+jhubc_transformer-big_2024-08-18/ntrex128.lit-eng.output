Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned that they “look like dolls”
Some members of the Assembly decided on the proposal to change their name to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This is related to the intention to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly are concerned that this could lead to ridicule at the political level.
One member of the Labour Assembly said his group was concerned that "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For non-Welsh readers: In Welsh, "twp" means "stupid" and "pwp" means "what".
A member of the Plaid Assembly said the whole group was "unsatisfied" and offered alternatives.
The Welsh Conservative said his faction was "open" to the name change, but noted that it was an abbreviation of the word from MWP to "doll".
For the Welsh letter w appears to be similar to the English letter u in Yorkshire.
The Assembly's committee, which is currently preparing draft legislation to change the name, said: "The final decision on the names of all the members of the Assembly will, of course, be a matter for the members themselves."
In 2017, the Welsh Government enacted a law giving the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on proposals that received strong support for naming the Assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the name of the Assembly, the Commission gave priority to members of the Welsh Parliament or the WMP, but the MWP received the greatest support during the public consultation.
MEPs are clearly proposing alternative options, but efforts to reach an agreement could turn into a headache for Elin Jones, the chairman, who is expected to table draft legislation on amendments in a few weeks' time.
Legislation on reforms will include other amendments to the work of the Assembly, including rules on the disqualification of a member of the Assembly and the system of the Committee.
When discussing legislation in the course of the debate, the members of the Assembly will have a decisive vote on what they should be called.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
A global vote was held to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long persistently claimed that the name of its northern neighbour means claims to Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's aspirations to join the EU and NATO.
Defying the plebiscite over the name change, Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov said he would ignore the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is simply a price that simply needs to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
During Harlem's troubles, the bells of St. Martin and other churches were silenced
“The old people I spoke to said that historically, there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
“You can’t find one or the other today.”
He said it was understandable why the bars disappeared.
“People are communicating differently these days,” he said.
“Bars are no longer a neighborhood site where people gather all the time.”
When it comes to churches, he worries that the money he gets from selling the property won’t last long, as leaders expect, “and sooner or later they’ll go back to where they started.”
He added that churches could be replaced with multi-apartments with cooperative apartments, where people would live who would not help the remaining temples.
"The majority of people who buy cooperative apartments in these apartments will be white," he said, "and therefore will hasten the moment when churches will be completely closed, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move to these cooperative apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations in 1870, before Harlem became a black metropolis – a metropolitan community, and St. Martin’s Church was built a decade later.
The original Congregation of White Methodists emerged in the 1920s.
A nearby congregation of black worshipers took over the name of the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a black congregation with Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a retail boycott of 125th Street, Harlem's main store, which refused to hire or appoint blacks to senior positions.
The building was badly damaged by a fire in 1939, but as the parishioners of the spiritual father Johnson planned to rebuild it, they ordered a carillon.
The clergyman David Johnson, the son of his spiritual father Johnson and heir to St. Martin's Church, proudly called the carillon the bells of the poor.
Experts, who have hailed July as a carillon, have called it a "cultural treasure" and an "inalienable historical instrument."
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also mentioned that it was the first carillon in the world played by black musician Dionysio A. Linda. 18 years ago, he started playing the larger carillon at Riverside Church.
Merriweather said St. Martin's Church did not replace him with another musician.
What has happened in the last few months in St. Martin’s Church has been a complex story involving architects and contractors, some of whom have been invited by church laymen, others by the episcopal diocese.
Zakhristia, a parish governing body made up of lay leaders, expressed concern to the diocese in July that the diocese would "try to pass on the costs" to Zakhristia, although it did not hire the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained that the diocese lacked transparency.
A shark in California has injured a lobster catcher at the age of 13.
Officials said the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he caught lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
He was attacked at 7 a.m. in Ensinitas near Svyturi beach.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV that he dived with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy shouting for help, and then arrived with a group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel told me at first that the boy was worried that he had caught the lobster, but then realized that the boy was shouting, “I’m being bitten!
They bite me!"
Hammel said that when he approached the boy, he noticed that all his keys had been stolen.
“I started shouting to everyone to get out of the water: ‘A shark is floating in the water!’” added Hammel.
The boy was flown to San Diego's Rady Children's Hospital, where he was admitted to critical condition.
What kind of shark attacked the boy is not known.
Rescue captain Larry Giles said in a news release that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was decided that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of the trunk.
Officials closed the beach for 48 hours for investigation and protection from Casablanca Ponte to Ensinitas Swami.
Giles mentioned that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury’s takes over Boots, Superdrug, and Debenhams with a universal store-style beauty department that will be staffed by specialist consultants.
With the UK's <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn beauty market continuing to grow and sales of fashion and household goods falling, larger beauty departments will be tested at 11 stores across the country and, if they are more successful, next year's launch.
Investment in beauty is growing, and shopping malls are looking for ways to use shelves, once intended for TVs, microwaves, and household items.
Sainsbury’s has announced it will double its beauty range to 3,000 product names, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more local branding in areas similar to stores such as Boots.
The mall is also re-launching its “Boutique” make-up range, most of which is vegan – this is increasingly demanded by younger buyers.
Fragrance Shop will also try out discounts at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second later this year in Seli Ouke, Birmingham.
As a result of online shopping and the desire to buy small quantities daily from local essential goods stores, shopping malls need to do more to attract people to visit there.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe said the brand's outlets are increasingly looking like universal stores as shopping mall chains try to combat selling cheaper goods at Aldi and Lidl stores by offering more services and non-food goods.
Sainsbury's added Argos outlets to hundreds of stores and also set up a number of Habitat stores as it bought both networks two years ago, which is said to have boosted food sales and made their purchase more profitable.
The previous attempt of the mall to renew its beauty and pharmacy department ended in failure.
In the early 1990s, Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots, but the union ended a dispute over how to allocate revenue from grocery stores.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold its store in its 281 stores for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago to the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy network, Celesio.
Lloyds’ contribution to the plan was said to include an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Sainsbury’s Commercial Director Paul Mills-Hicks said: “We’ve changed the exterior and atmosphere of the beauty department to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be ready to give advice.
Our range of brands has been designed to meet every need, and because of the attractive environment and convenient locations, we are now an attractive place of beauty that challenges the old way of purchasing."
Peter Jones is ‘stuck’ because Holly Willoughby has cut a <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal with him
Dragons Den star Peter Jones "entered" after TV host Holly Willoughby cut an <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby no longer has time for their home sales and accessories for the Truly brand.
The couple's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning host announced she was leaving on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby, after leaving a lucrative lifestyle brand at the last minute to focus on her new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, angered Dragons Den star Peter Jones.
Sources say Jones was "engaged" when a gold television girl at his business empire headquarters in Marlou (Backinghamshire) admitted that new deals worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5m would take no more than a year for her to spend on him.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand, and was predicted to have doubled Willoughby's <0xC2><0xA3>11 million assets.
After 37-year-old Willoughby announced he was leaving Truly on Instagram, Jones flew out of the UK to one of his summer taverns.
The source said: “Truly has so far been one of Holly’s top priorities.
This should have been its long-term future, lasting for the next couple of decades.
Her decision to leave was an astonishing one.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, because the beginning was so close.
There is a full warehouse of ready-to-sell goods at Marlou headquarters."
Experts believe that the exit of The Morning, one of the UK’s most financially successful stars, could cost the company millions because of large investments in products, starting with pillows and candles, and ending with clothes and household items, which will also lead to the re-emergence of things that will make a difference in the future.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby’s mother and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been in close contact with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for decades.
Willoughby and T. Capp founded Truly in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as president.
The couple is on vacation together, and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and replace ITV's I'm A Celebrity host Anta McPartlin.
A source close to Jones said yesterday, “We will not comment on his business affairs.”
We talked a lot and then we fell in love.
He ridiculed the criticism he received from the media for the comment, which some might call "non-presidential," as well as the fact that he has such a positive reaction to North Korea's leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
In a succinct “news leader” voice, he said:
“I didn’t say anything.”
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June was backed by a major step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
Negotiations on nuclear disarmament have been tightened.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not receive a "appropriate response" from the US on North Korea's withdrawal.
He noted that the U.S. is instead continuing sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
In his speech, he expressed a much more optimistic attitude.
“We have a good relationship with North Korea,” he said.
We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We have a very good relationship now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results: it was the end of missile tests, aid in the release of hostages and the return of American troops to their homes.
He defended his unusual approach by talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people wanting to get into this crowded arena, we’d better have about 200 people standing here,” Trump said, pointing to a crowd standing right in front of him.
Indonesia’s tsunami and earthquake wiped out the island, killing hundreds of people
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were informed that their assistance was not needed.
While more than 10% of the population of Lombok were displaced, this was not declared a national disaster – a prerequisite for providing international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, it has been said very clearly that international assistance is not needed, so it’s a bit complicated,” Sumbung said.
While “Saving the Children” is preparing a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet clear whether overseas workers will be able to work on the spot.
A spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, Sutopo, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid.
In view of Indonesia’s ongoing earthquakes, the country is still sadly unprepared for nature’s anger.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, they are not common on other coasts.
Due to the obvious lack of tsunami warning sirens, Palu, despite the announced warning, is likely to have increased the loss of life.
The best time to travel between many Indonesian islands is difficult.
As a result of natural disasters, logistics becomes even more complex.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok, which treats victims of the earthquake, is sailing to Palu, but it will reach the site of the new disaster in at least three days.
President Joko Widodo has chosen the reconstruction of Indonesia’s infrastructure at the heart of his election campaign, spending generously on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding did not give the Joko administration peace, because in the coming years he will again take part in the elections.
Joko is also facing pressure from the ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim majority members adhere to a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands expelled from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, bows with arrows and other simple weapons.
Watch: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge strikes a long-distance draw in a game against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing the Premier League to Chelsea in the 89th minute, scoring a goal at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London on Saturday.
With their team 1-0 behind, Xherdan Shaqiri handed the ball about 30 metres from the Chelsea goal to former Sturridge.
He threw the ball on his left leg and hit the ball in the direction of the far swing.
The ball lifted high above the penalty area flew to the right upper corner of the net.
He eventually crossed over the sprawling Kepa Arrizabalaga and reached the net.
“I was just trying to get the ball and players like Shaq always play as far ahead as possible, so I just tried to stay as long as possible for the shot,” Sturridge said.
“I saw Kant running away, I corrected the ball with one stroke and, without thinking too much, I just asked.”
After a 25-minute head-to-head defeat by Belgian star Eden Hazard, Chelsea took the lead 1-0.
During that attack, the "blues" striker in the middle of the square gave the ball back to Mateo Kovacicius and rushed towards the Liverpool side.
In the middle of the room, the wall quickly collapsed.
He then sent the ball between the opponents to Hazard, who was crashing into the penalty area.
Hazard overtook the defenders and, through Liverpool player Alisson Becker, hit his left leg and steered the ball into the net at a distance.
The Liverpool team will play against Napoli at the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will meet Videoton in the UEFA European League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has reached 832.
As the country’s disaster agency reported on Sunday, the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
The agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, told a news conference that many people were stuck in the ruins of buildings that were destroyed by a 7.5-point earthquake that triggered a six-metre wave on Friday.
The city of Palu, home to more than 380,000 people, has been demolished by demolished buildings.
Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Man Suspected of Murdering Woman
The murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Berkenhede, Mississippi.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 a.m. near Greison Mouse, John Street, with a 32-year-old man who was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called on anyone who has seen or heard people in the area to speak out.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “For the time being, the stage of the investigation is early, but I would like to address everyone who has been near John Street in Berkenhed and has seen or heard anything suspected of contacting us.
I would also like to appeal to everyone, especially taxi drivers, who could have captured something with a video recorder, and contact us because they may have information that is essential to our investigation."
A police official confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Berkenhed and she was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends who know the woman came to the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
Investigations are still underway as police say they are informing the victim's immediate relatives.
A taxi driver living in Greison Mouse had just tried to return to his apartment, but police said no one was allowed to enter and leave the building.
He lost hope when they found out what had happened.
Residents are now told that they will have to wait a few hours before they will be allowed to return home.
It was heard that a police officer explained to one person that the entire territory is now considered a crime scene.
The woman appeared at the scene of the crime.
She kept saying, “That’s so scary.”
At 2 p.m., two police vans were standing in front of the fence on the inside, and another van was outside.
Many officers stood on the inside of the fence and watched the apartment block.
Anyone with information is requested to write to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, citing September 30th, number 247.
Parliament's Cromwell statue suffers the last blow of a "rewrite of history" dispute.
Its removal would be poetic justice for the destruction of England’s cultural and religious heritage, reminiscent of the actions of the Taliban, for which the fanatical followers of the Cromwell Puritans are responsible.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick's proposal as "stupidity" and an "attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the course of the current debate on the transfer of statues, Oliver Cromwell’s statue to the Palace of Westminster inevitably had to become a target.
Cromwell did not order and did not carry out the iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps not that Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Tom in the last century.
Created by Sir William Ham Thorneycroft, the stunning image of Cromwell is a reflection of the 19th-century approach and part of the historiography of the figure, which many still consider worthy of honor.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people, perhaps more numerous in the late 19th century than today, considered Cromwell a defender of parliament from external pressure, which of course was a monarchy.
Whether this is completely accurate is disputed by historians to this day.
One is clear that the conflict of the middle of the seventeenth century formed the later development of our nation, and Cromwell became an exceptional figure representing one of the sides of this division.
His achievements as a defender of the Lord are also worth mentioning and honoring."
Pig Killer Kills Chinese Farmer
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in the southwestern Chinese market.
On Sunday, the Morning Post reported that a man named Yuan was found dead. Due to the damaged artery, he was surrounded by blood and lay next to a pig in the market of the Lupunshan pig, in Guizhou province (south China).
On 30 May 2005, a pig farmer in Xingcheng (Chinghai Province, China) prepared to inject vaccines to pigs in the pig litter.
He said he and his cousin from neighbouring Junan province were planning to travel to the market on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, his cousin found a dead relative and found the door to a nearby piglet open.
He said there was a big pig in the piggy bank whose mouth was smeared with blood.
According to the report, a court review confirmed that a pig weighing 250 kilograms had torn the farmer apart.
"Guiyang Evening News quotes: 'My cousin's legs were bloody and injured,'" the cousin said, citing his name Wu.
A security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
Yuan or his cousin did not belong to the animal that killed the man.
The market leader told Evening News that the pig had to be locked up to stop attacking other people and held until police collected evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating death compensation.
Although few, however, cases of attacking pigs have been recorded in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, and the man was particularly badly injured.
Ten years ago, a pig weighing 295 kilograms pushed a Welsh farmer to the tractor and pressed it until his wife took it off.
After pigs ate an Oregon farmer in 2012, one Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but aggressiveness can be triggered by bloody taste.
“They’re just playful.
They like to sting, very curious... unwilling to hurt anyone.
You just have to respect them accordingly,” he said.
Hurricane Rose Remains Will Bring Heavy Rain to U.S. Southwest
Hurricane Rosa is projected to weaken as it moves through cooler waters off Mexico’s northern coast.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring heavy rain to all of northern Mexico and the U.S. Southwest.
As of 5 a.m. on Sunday, Rosa was moving at 137 km/h as a Category 1 hurricane and was 620 km southwest of Cape Euchenia (Mexico).
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
At the same time, on the Pacific side, a stretched low-pressure zone begins to form and moves eastwards toward the U.S. west coast. As the Rose approaches the California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to carry a large amount of tropical moisture into the U.S.
On Monday, Rosa will cause up to 25 centimeters of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Then the tropical humidity interacting with the approaching stretch of the low-pressure zone will bring in the coming days extensively declining heavy rain to the southwest.
Instead of 2.5 to 10 centimeters of rain, it will cause dangerous sudden flooding, debris flow and possible landslides in the desert.
Due to the high humidity of the tropics in some places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona, precipitation will fall from 5 to 8 centimeters per hour.
5 to 8 centimeters of rain is expected in the southwestern regions, especially in a large part of Arizona.
Due to the nature of tropical rains, sudden flooding and rapidly deteriorating conditions are possible.
When rainstorms are threatening, it would be a particularly bad idea to get into the desert on foot.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into swarming rivers, and thunderstorms could cause wind and dust dogs.
The approaching stretch of the low-pressure zone will bring some local heavy rain to the southern California coast.
It is expected to receive more than 1 centimeter of precipitation, which can cause a small debris flow, and the roads can become slippery.
This would be the first wet season in the region.
Some tropical rain showers will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, and later rain will spread late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains across Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah will spread on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature fluctuations are possible across the U.S. as the Arctic cools, but the tropical zone will be quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to large changes in temperature over short distances.
Sunday was a great example of the huge temperature differences in the central United States.
The temperatures of Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska) are almost 20 degrees different from the temperatures of St. Louis and Di Moino (Ajova).
In the next few days, the summer heat should rise again and cover more places.
It is expected that in the major U.S. central and eastern parts, from the Great Southern Plains to the northeastern regions, the trails will be warmer in October with a much-predominant 27-degree temperature.
Temperatures in New York City are expected to rise to 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows that the temperature in the eastern US in the first half of October will be higher than the average perennial temperature.
More than 20 million people watched Bretto Kavanaugh’s trial
More than 20 million people watched on six television broadcasts on Thursday, drawing attention to Supreme Court nominee Bretto Kavanaugh’s remarks and the accusations of sexual violence by woman Christine Blasey Ford in the 1990s.
But the political impasse continued after broadcasters cut off regular programs over Friday’s last-minute shift: Arizona’s senator drafted an agreement for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the throwing charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee it was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh, who was cheering at a high school party, was grabbing her and trying to take her clothes off.
Kavanaugh said in an angry testimony that he was absolutely certain that it was not.
Nielsen said on Friday it was possible that more than 20.4 million people watched the show.
The company calculated the average number of viewers watching the broadcast on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some difficulty counting people watching TV in offices.
To make it more understandable, it is an audience of the same size as would be created during relegation football matches or Oscars.
Nielsen reported that the Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported Kavanaugh's candidacy, was the first of all networks to reach an average of 5.69 million spectators during the full-day court session.
ABC, which received 3.26 million viewers, was in second place.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million viewers.
There was still a lot of interest after the trial.
The main character in Friday’s drama was Flake.
After a small Republican office announced a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was apprehended by CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning as protesters shouted at him as he tried to get up by elevator to a court committee meeting.
CNN directly filmed him with his eyes down when he was flooded by people.
“I’m standing here in front of you,” one woman said.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
He was told, “You have power when so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office issued a statement and, before closing the elevator, added that he would have more to say at a court committee meeting.
Later, cable television and broadcast networks discussed directly when the Judiciary Committee voted for Kavanaugh's candidacy for the Senate.
However, Flake said he would only do so knowing that the FBI would investigate charges against the candidate over the next week, which the Democratic minority called for to be investigated.
Flake, speaking with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, was partly convinced.
After talking to Coons and several senators, Flake made the decision.
Flake’s choice had power because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to confirm Kavanaugh without conducting the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's allegations.
UK Prime Minister Accuses Critics of 'Playing Politics' on Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused her of planning to leave the European Union to “play politics” with Britain’s future and harm the national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham (UK) on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, published after her photo on the front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued to attack her so-called “Brexit” plan for the “Shakespeare” that Britain and the EU should collect tariffs from each other, saying it was “absurd”.
Wayde Sims Shooting Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson Suspect for Death of LSU Player
Police have arrested a man suspected of shooting 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department reported that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and jailed on charges of second-degree murder.
Officials released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the clash.
CBS affiliate WAFB reports that police took the glasses from the scene and found Simpson's DNA on them.
When Simpson was questioned, police said he had shot Wayde dead.
The lawyer informs that the security deposit for his release is $350,000.
The Eastern Baton Rouge Parish expert service released a preliminary report on Friday, which said the cause of death was a shot in the head, slid into the neck.
The department is dedicated to the Louisiana State Police Refugee Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and residents of the district who helped in the investigation that led to the arrest of the suspect.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the district's law enforcement for "rigor and justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98-metre-tall guy grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball at LSU.
Last season, the youngster averaged 5.6 points in the game and scored 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "shocked".
“We think about it all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano spews ash in Mexico City
From the Popokatepetl volcano, ashes erupted that reached the southern vicinity of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano, when increased crater activity was recorded and gas and ash emissions were recorded 183 times in 24 hours.
The center observed a number of demolitions and tremors.
The social media photos show car windshields covered in a thin layer of ash in the surrounding areas of Mexico, such as Cho<0xC4><0x8D>imilke.
Geophysicists have noted that activity in the volcano 72 km south-east of the capital has increased since a 7.1-point earthquake in September 2017 rocked central Mexico.
The volcano, called Donu Gojo, has been active since 1994.
Before the independence vote, police clashed with Catalan separatists
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protesters for independence clashed with riot police and thousands joined opposition demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of Catalonia's secession vote.
The riot police braking a group of masked separatists were bombarded with eggs and powder paint. This caused dark clouds of dust in the streets, which are usually crowded with tourists.
Police used the sticks to stop the clashes that started later in the day.
Within hours, independence groups chanting “Unforgettable, unforgivable” met with Unionist protesters shouting, “Long live Spain!”
Local media reported that 14 people were being treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests.
A year after the referendum on 1 October, which Madrid considers illegal but which is being debunked by Catalan separatists, tensions remain high in the region seeking independence.
Most voters decided to become independent, but due to a large part of the vote, the activity of voters who boycotted the vote who did not want to separate was low.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when police tried to stop voting in the electoral districts across the region.
On Friday night, the independence groups set up a camp to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to change the route.
The 68-year-old electrician, Narcissus Termes, who was involved in the separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer certain about Catalonia's prospect of independence.
“Last year we had one of the best moments.
I watched my parents happily shout at those who could vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite a vital and hard-won victory in last December’s regional elections, Catalonia’s independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year when many of their most notorious leaders have resigned as a result of involuntary exile or incarceration.
Supporting the police, 42-year-old mechanic Joan Puig, who filmed the protest on his phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
“Tension is constantly rising,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been held in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would take part in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Candidates in the European Parliament elections are the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and the repression demonstrated by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderis. Arrested the men who entered the house by car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after being re-entered the Londonderry home by car.
The incident took place on Thursday at about 7.30 p.m. (BVL) in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gate and the building itself were damaged.
At some point, the car could also have been shot with a crossbow.
Menga's strike secured Livingston's 1-0 win over Rangers
Livingston player Dolly Menga's first innings guaranteed victory
Livingston's move to the top of the league surprised the Rangers, forcing Ibrox club manager Steven Gerrard to lose the second of 18 games.
Dolly Menga's strike proved to be very important, because in an instant, Gary Holt's team equated with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team remains an undefeated away game this season in the Premier League and will meet the leaders of the Hearts next Sunday, from which they are behind by eight points.
Earlier on Thursday, the Rangers played a European League game at home with Vienna's Rapid.
At the time, Livingston extended its record-breaking unbeaten division series to six, and head coach Holt has yet to feel the taste of defeat as he replaced Kenny Miller just last month.
Livingston misses their chances in a game with the local guests
Even before hitting the lead, Holt's team, due to their perseverance, had to be at the front of the Rangers for a long time.
At first, Scott Robinson broke through and hit the gate, then Alan Lithgow failed to reach the ball passed by Craig Halkett's head and this landed next to the gate.
The hosts, allowing the Rangers to play in the front, did not worry, because they knew that they could add trouble to the guests by creating standard positions.
That is exactly how the decisive impulse was put in place.
The Rangers missed a free-kick and Livingston began to push forward; Declan Gallagher and Robinson gave the ball to Menga in a joint effort, and Menga won the ball from the penalty spot when he was stabbed.
Rangers have controlled the ball for a longer time since then, but the hosts' defense was invincible and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had almost no job.
The game continued in the second innings, although Kelly had to work on Alfredo Morelos' strike to the goal.
Scott Pittman's Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor knocked off his leg, and after another Lithgow's standard Lithgow shot, the ball flew near the goal.
While the passing ball was constantly in the penalty area of Livingston, it was suffocated each time, with two demands for a penalty – one for Halkett’s collision with Glenn Middleton, who ran into the court after the change, and the other for touching the ball with his hand.
Analysis of the phenomenal appearance of Livingston
BBC Scotland reporter Alasdair Lamont from Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal "Livingston" game and result.
All up to one they were excellent and continued to exceed expectations due to the ever-improvement of the game.
The style of the game and the staff has hardly changed since returning to the top league, but great merits are due to Holt, because on arrival he ignited the team.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett played great with a well-organized defense, and Menga managed to keep Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall safe.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although under the leadership of Gerrard, they play well, but this time they missed a lot to reach their level.
They hit the decisive blows a little and only once broke through the defense of the hosts. Some anxiety call in the middle of the table to the Rangers team.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an was met in Cologne in various ways.
On Saturday (September 29th), there was smiles and blue skies as Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, when it was aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
The leaders argued over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new huge mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish community outside of Turkey.
Police banned 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters came to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also tried to be heard condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to accept him in their own country.
Various protests show a fragmentation of visitors: some German Turks consider him a hero, while others call him a dictator.
Road accident in Deptford. In the collision with the car, the cyclist died
In London, a cyclist died in a car collision.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, Juddish Deptford Road, in the southeast of the city, at approximately 10.15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The accident occurred several months after another biker was killed on Childers Street, picked up by the culprit, who then fled. The accident occurred about 1.6 km from the accident on Saturday.
The city police said officials were trying to identify the man and inform his immediate relatives.
Roads are closed and bus routes are changed, drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartino prison. Six officers injured in the crash
The prison service reported that six prison officials were injured in a major clash in a special security men's prison.
The crash took place at HMP Long Lartin prison in Vu<0xC5><0xA1>ter<0xC5><0xA1>yra on Sunday at around 9:30 a.m. BVL, where it still lives.
Special Tornado officials have been summoned to handle this clash involving eight prisoners and it takes place in one wing of the prison.
Officials are treated for minor facial injuries at the site of the incident.
A spokesman for the prison service said: “Specially trained prison staff have been summoned to manage the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members were treated for their injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we are sure that the responsible persons will be handed over to the police and, if possible, will spend a longer time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that a prison warden was being treated at the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, riot officials were summoned to prison to deal with a serious breakdown in which some workers were bombarded with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with its sudden floods (it can be useful for dry areas)
It is not common for the tropical depression to hit Arizona, but it is likely to happen next week when Hurricane Rosa with its remaining energy will hit the desert southwest and this will cause a sudden flood risk.
The National Meteorological Service has already announced to monitor the sudden flood on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, spreading to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
As the rain approaches late Monday, Rosa is expected to head straight to Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix noted that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or tropical depression status no further than 322 kilometers from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane not more than 64 kilometers from the Arizona border.
Using the latest models of the National Hurricane Center, it is predicted that the tide will fall between 5 and 10 centimeters, and in some parts of Arizona Mogolon Rimo, the amount of precipitation will reach 5 centimeters.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to reach 2.5 to 5 centimeters, and some may drop up to 10 centimeters of precipitation.
For people who are not threatened by sudden flooding, Pink rain can be a blessing as the region suffers from drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, for some these precipitations can be beneficial, as the southwest is currently suffering from droughts.
“According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Center, just over 40 percent of Arizona’s population suffers from a very severe drought, which is the second highest category,” the report said.
First, Hurricane Rosa is heading for the coast across the entire California peninsula, which belongs to Mexico.
On Sunday, Rosa, still in the category of hurricane with a huge 137 km/h wind, is 619 kilometers south of the capital, and is moving north at 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific region and is therefore raging.
Thus, it is expected to reach the coast of Mexico with the force of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Flooding in certain parts of Mexico can be severe and pose a high risk of flooding.
“From the California peninsula to the northwest of Sonora, it is expected to reach 8 to 15 centimeters, but the possible thing is up to 25 centimeters of precipitation,” the weather.com reported.
Then Rosa will pull north through Mexico like a tropical storm, later, on Tuesday morning, she will reach the border of Arizona already like a tropical depression, and on Tuesday evening she will pull through Arizona towards southern Utah.
“The main danger expected from the Rose or its remnants is very heavy rainfall on the California peninsula, in the northwestern Sonora and in the southwestern U.S. desert,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to cause sudden flooding, debris flowing into deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Attacking Midsamer Norton. Arrested four people suspected of attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in Midsamer Norton's Excelsior terrace area at around 04:00 a.m. according to the BVL on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and is now in stable condition.
A 17-year-old man, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area last night.
Officials have appealed to all persons who may have any material filmed on a mobile phone about what happened.
Short says Kavanaugh “has suffered from the democrat party’s scorn, anger.”
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote we would like to reject the relentless and offensive tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said in a speech in Wilkinson, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "experienced the democrats' folly, anger" during his candidacy.
Kavanaugh testified to Congress on Thursday, vehemently and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the trial on his charges.
On Saturday, the president said that “the Americans saw on that day how great, noble and courageous Kavanaugh was.
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a credible reputation in the field of public services,” he said.
The president indirectly hinted at Kavanaugh's candidacy, while talking about the importance of Republican election activity in midterm elections.
“We have five weeks left before the most important elections in our lives.
“I’m not involved, but I’m really involved,” he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting everywhere for great candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats wanted to “oppose and obstruct.”
GOP chief aide CNN said the first major procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh should take place no later than Friday.
Hundreds of deaths from Indonesian earthquake and tsunami continue to rise
Authorities said at least 384 people were killed, many of them illuminated by huge waves hitting the beach when a strong earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia's Sulawesi island.
Hundreds of people gathered at the Palu city beach festival on Friday when a six-metre-high wave hit the coast, killing many and destroying everything that happened on the road.
After the tsunami, there was a 7.5-point earthquake.
"When the tsunami threatened yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they became victims," BNPB Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told reporters in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t blow itself up, it tore down cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that before the tsunami hit the coast, the open sea was flowing at 800 km/h.
He said that some people climbed trees to avoid a tsunami and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 Palu centres.
Aerial photographs of the disaster agency showed that a number of buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges were bent and collapsed, and the mosque was surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the seaside town was further shaken by repeated blows.
A series of earthquakes has been felt in an area that is home to 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) reported that the energy released on Friday during a particularly strong earthquake exceeded the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II about 200 times.
It has been reported that the tsunami may have intensified due to the geographical location of the city, as it is located at the end of a long, narrow bay.
Nugroho described the damage as "large" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been destroyed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the ruins of buildings, later adding that 540 people were injured and 29 people disappeared without knowing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage could be higher along the coast, located 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Nugroho said the communications networks "were completely paralyzed, so no information was received" from Dongala.
“There are more than 300,000 people living there,” a Red Cross spokesman said in a statement, adding that workers and volunteers are traveling to disaster-affected areas.
It was said that "this can already be considered a tragedy, but the situation can worsen even further."
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticized for not reporting the tsunami hit Palu, although officials said the waves had come after a warning was issued.
A man on the top floor of the building can be heard in the shared social media amateur material, shouting about the impending tsunami to people standing down the street.
Within a few minutes, a water wall breaks into the shore, carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately approve the filmed material.
As a result of the earthquake and tsunami, the electricity supply was disrupted and the communication networks around Palu were cut off, and it was difficult for the authorities to coordinate the provision of aid.
Authorities said the military had started sending cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities with relief supplies, but the evacuated people still needed food and other essential supplies.
The city’s airport was reopened only to provide assistance and will be closed until October.
President Yoko Widodo planned to visit the Palu evacuation centers on Sunday.
The tsunami in Indonesia has killed more than 800 people.
That's very bad.
Doseba reported that when World Vision staff from Dongala were safely traveling to Palu city, where workers are crammed into the canopy tents built in the backyard of the office, the road was accompanied by ruined images.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
That's very bad.
Even as aid groups began to take complex steps to provide disaster relief, some people complained that experienced foreign aid workers were banned from travelling to Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, financing, provision and staff recruited from abroad can only help when the site of the disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a disaster at the provincial level," Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross, told reporters.
“When the government says, ‘Yes, this is a national disaster,’ we can call for international aid, but that status has not yet been announced.”
On the second night after Friday’s Palu earthquake and tsunami, friends and relatives of the missing people hoped that their loved ones would become part of a miracle that would affect the grim history of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped in the rubble near her mother’s body for two days.
Indonesia’s national paragliding team coach Gendon Subandono has coached two missing Asian paragliders who ended up in Indonesia earlier this month.
Others who were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Monday, were his disciples.
“As a senior in the field of paragliding, I carry my emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon narrated in detail how within hours, after announcing the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel, this news traveled around the parachute sports community. He desperately sent messages using the WhatsApp app to the Palu contestants who participated in the festival beach.
However, his messages contained only one gray, not two blue buckles.
“I think that means that the messages were not received,” he said.
The Newport on the Levee Theft Center Stole $26,750
According to a Newport Police Department press release, the robbers stole $26,750 on Friday morning from a Brink's employee who filled an ATM at the Newport on the Levee entertainment center.
“The driver of the car was empty at the ATM in the entertainment complex and ready to add more money,” Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While he was busy, another man "escaped from behind Brink's employee's back" and stole a bag of money to replenish.
Witnesses said they spotted several suspects fleeing the scene, but police were unable to determine the number of people involved in the crime.
Any person with information about their identity should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West. The rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
On Saturday, he tweeted about the changes to his Twitter account: "A person formerly officially known as Kanye West."
The 41-year-old had been called Ye for some time and named it the eighth album, which was released in June.
The changes began ahead of Saturday Night Live, where West was expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
He must replace singer Ariana Granda, who canceled the show for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
This is not only an abbreviation of the current professional name - West has said earlier that this word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year, referring to the album’s title with radio host Big Boy.
“So I’m you, I’m us, that means us.
It started with Kanye, which means the only one, and became simply Ye, which means the reflection of our good, evil, confusion, everything.
The album is more about who we are.”
He is one of many famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names of Love and Fraternal Love.
A former West colleague, JAY-Z, also changed his name and used it with or without a dash and capital letters.
Mexican politician Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador (abbreviated AMLO) vows not to use troops against civilians.
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has vowed never to use military forces against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on students.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised on Saturday that he would "never use military forces to deter the people of Mexico."
On October 2, 1968, when left-wing student movements began across Latin America, representatives of the military in the square fired at a peaceful demonstration, killing 300 people.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has solemnly pledged to support young Mexicans every month by subsidizing students and opening more free state universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities involve young people in criminal groups.
U.S. Should Double Artificial Intelligence Funding
“As China becomes increasingly active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount spent on research in this area,” said investor and AI specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments came after various U.S. government bodies published reports on artificial intelligence, even the fact that the U.S. is not at all an official artificial intelligence strategy.
China, meanwhile, has unveiled its plan to lead artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
“A doubled AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are more advanced than the US and are looking forward to another breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence,” Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the likelihood that another major artificial intelligence achievement will be in the U.S., as Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “Artificial Intelligence Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the CEO of Synovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent artificial intelligence companies, Face+.
In the 1990s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked with an artificial intelligence system that defeated the top-ranked American Othello player, and later was the head of Microsoft Research and president of Google’s Chinese affiliate.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be to help find more insightful people.
Lee said U.S. scientists often have to struggle to win state grants.
“It’s not China that takes away academic leaders, it’s companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired bright minds from universities to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. strengthen efforts on artificial intelligence.
“I think that PhD students working in the field of artificial intelligence should be automatically offered green cards,” he said.
In July 2017, the Council of State of China announced its plan for the development of the New Generation of Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, Lee said, China’s National Natural Science Foundation funds people from academic institutions, similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations donating money to U.S. scientists, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the establishment of a Special Artificial Intelligence Committee.
This month, DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) announced a US$2 billion investment for the AI Next initiative.
The NSF is currently investing more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
In the coming months, however, nothing has been done about US legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission in the field of artificial intelligence.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the country's name
In a referendum on Sunday, Macedonians voted to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked its aspirations to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province of Macedonia, says the name of its northern neighbor means claims to Greek territory and has vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments agreed on a proposed new name, but opponents of nationalists say the name change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of the Macedonian Slav population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign expressed doubts about whether the voter turnout would reach the minimum 50% required for the referendum to take effect.
A referendum question was put on the ballot: “Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU if you agree to an agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, is worth paying the price of joining institutions such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I came to vote for the future of the country, the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely, protected by the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
While legally non-binding, enough MEPs have said they will stick to the voting results and make them decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament would be necessary to change the name.
The state election commission said there were no reports of violations until 1 p.m.
But voter turnout was as low as 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of voters cast their ballots.
“I came to vote for my children, for our place in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter in Skopje.
Macedonian MP Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Du<0xC5><0xA1>ko are voting in a referendum held in Macedonia on changing the name of the country to open the way to joining NATO and the European Union. Macedonia, September 30, 2018
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and pulled chairs in front of the tents, which were built by the boycotters of the referendum.
“We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not enter through the doors of the servants,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If you don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can go to others, like China and Russia, and participate in Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate reaches more than 20 percent, will attract much-needed investment.
"I believe that the vast majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said.
The result, he said, would be “a guarantee of our future.”
According to the results of the survey published by the Macedonian Policy Research Institute last Monday, 30 to 43 percent of voters are expected to participate in the referendum - less than the required voter activity.
According to another poll conducted by Macedonian TV “Telma”, 57 percent of respondents are preparing to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said they would vote “yes”.
For a referendum to be successful, it must be attended by 50 percent of voters plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it would be the first serious failure of the pro-Caribbean government’s policy since it took power in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero beats all of Brighton's defense and winning streak
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling beat Brighton's defense, and the Manchester City team scored a 2-0 victory at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, on Saturday.
In the 65th minute, Aguero scored an unbelievably easy goal.
The Argentine striker received the ball in the middle of the court at the beginning of the attack.
Before bursting into the open field, he slipped between the three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four players in green t-shirts.
He splashed through one defender, before overtaking several others at the edge of the Brighton penalty area.
He then handed the ball to the left where Sterling was.
The English striker returned the ball to Aguero with a single spear from the penalty area, and this right-footed striker dropped the ball to the right side of the goal net, beating Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan.
“Aguero has problems with his feet,” City chief Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We said he was playing 55-60 minutes.
Here's how it was.
We were lucky that he won the race at the time.”
However, it was Sterling who helped Sky Blues make the first move forward in these Premier League games.
The game was won in the 29th minute.
During the attack, Aguero received the ball while he was in the depths of Brighton.
On the left side of the court between the two opponents, he passed the ball beautifully to Leroy Sane.
Sane swung the ball forward with a few spears until Sterling made his way to the farthest corner.
The Sky Blues striker dropped the ball into the gate just before it slipped from the outside of the court.
On Tuesday, at 12:55 p.m., City will meet Hoffenheim in a Champions League group game at the Zinsheim Arena in Rhein-Neckar (Germany).
Scherzer wants to play a friendly game with the Rockies
After the Nationals dropped out of relegation, there were no more compelling reasons to push back.
A competitive Scherzer hopes to beat the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a chance to stay in relegation; in the West National League they beat the Los Angeles Dodgers by one point.
The Rockies, who beat the Nationals 5-2 on Friday night, have at least secured a chance to get a discount, but will still have to make an effort to secure the right to play in the first division.
“Although we’re playing for nothing, at least we’ll be able to escape to the pitch knowing that the atmosphere in Denver, where a crowd of people and another team will gather, will probably be at the highest level we can reach this year.
Why don't you get angry?"
The team's starting line-up for Sunday's game has not yet been announced by the Nationals, but they are clearly inclined to release Scherzer in this case.
Scherzer, who will be 34th in the squad for this match, took a shot training session on Thursday and will take the shooting position on his usual day of rest – Sunday.
Washington’s right-handed stats this season: 18-7, 2.53 ERA and 300 cars over 220 2/3 pickup.
He is speaking in West Virginia.
Talking about the importance of the activity of Republican voters in the midterm elections, the president indirectly refers to the situation regarding the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
“Everything we have achieved will be put on the scales in November.
There are probably five weeks left before the most important elections in our lives.
“It’s very important, I’m not running... but I’m actually running, that’s why I’m fighting everywhere for great candidates,” he said.
“You see this horrible, horrible group of democrats, you see how it’s happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means, you see how low it is, how evil.
They don’t care what they’ve hurt, what they’ve gone through to get power and control; that’s what they really want — power and control — but we’re not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, have a mission to “resist and obstruct.”
“And you’ve seen it for the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “painful, ugly, lowly, and wrong people.”
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, mentioning the name of Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which sparked huge ovations from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Have you leaked the document?
Oh, um, how.
No, um... no, I'm waiting for one -- it was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party has lost its diversity of opinion.
They do not tolerate openly expressing their opinions.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted for distrust of me, I asked if it should have been a surprise.
Finally, I am the latest of the Labour MPs who have been told that I am unwelcome, and that is for my expressed opinion.
My fellow Member, Joan Ryan, received similar threats because she was determined to stand up to anti-Semitism.
My distrust was expressed in criticizing me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, on similar issues that Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The report on the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated that "we want many members to be involved in the meetings and that the meetings will be productive."
For most of the eight years that I was a local Labour MP, Friday evening’s GC meetings were just like that.
It is sad that the tone of many meetings today is not quite the same as the promises of a "milder, gentler" policy that have long been forgotten, even if they have ever been implemented at all.
It is increasingly clear that a different opinion in the Labour Party is not tolerated and that each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the party.
It started shortly after Jeremy became party leader, and colleagues, who, as I had previously hoped, had similar political views, began to expect me to turn a 180-degree angle and follow views that I would never agree with – whether on the national security or on the EU common.
Whenever I speak in public – and no matter what – there are a lot of insults on social media that encourage my dismissal, condemn the policy of the centre and say that I have no place in the Labour Party.
And it’s not just my experience.
In fact, I have been much more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me are political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have to endure an avalanche of sexist and racist insults every day.
One of the most disappointing things about this political era is how insults have become a normal phenomenon.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the same party of views, and with every “distrust” procedure or change in the electoral system, this party is getting smaller and smaller.
Over the past two years, I have received a lot of advice that encourages me not to jump, not to speak so loudly, and then with me “everything will be fine”.
But that’s not what I came into politics for.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, provoked by the negligence of the Thatcher government, which in the true sense of the word has ruined my entire school class, I have sought to win better public services for those who need it most, or for those who are most in need of it.
I have never concealed my policies, including the last election.
No one at Nottingham East should have been surprised by my political views and my disagreement with current leaders in any way.
To those who promoted this procedure on Friday, I can tell you that when a country cashes in on Brexit, which will affect households, businesses and public services, I do not realize the desire to waste time and energy because of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, one message I have for the Nottingham Momentum is for my constituents, Labour members (or not): I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of revocation or political expediency will stop me from acting in accordance with my own interests and the best of yours.

Ayr-Melrose – 38:17 Invincible Ayr conquers table tops
Two late attempts somewhat distorted the final results, but there’s no doubt that Ayr deserved this moment of triumph in the impressive, promising Tennent’s Premiership Day game.
Now the team is at the top of the table – the only one not defeated.
Ultimately, the victory brought them an impeccable defense and well-exploited opportunities, so coach Peter Murchie can really feel satisfied.
"We have taken all the tests in all the games that have taken place so far and we are still invincible, so I am really happy," he said.
Robbie Christie of Melrose said: “Ayr turned out well, the players used their chances better than us.”
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt, which was successfully completed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scotsman Rory Hughes, which was released by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to collect the numbers, while Baggot did not stop.
Climo increased Ayr's penalty advantage when he scored points in the middle of the race and successfully finished the personal test, helping Ayr to pull back before the break with a score of 17:5.
However, Melrose started the second set well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which Baggot successfully completed, narrowed the gap to five points.
The game was halted for a longer period of time as Ruaridh Knott suffered a serious injury and was transported out of the open to the carriers. The prolonged game by Ayr continued to push ahead when Stafford McDowall successfully completed the Climo trial.
Ayr captain Blair Macpherson was given a yellow card, and Melrose tried to take advantage of the players' surplus, but Bruce Colvine's attempt after the severe pressure ended was unsuccessful.
The home team player returned, however, after Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for stopping Climo without the ball, MacPherson pushed the ball off the penalty line for the continuing Ayr squats.
Climo successfully completed his try, as he had done almost right from the start of the replay, after Kyle Rowe held David Armstrong's spear to the corner of the court and prevented striker Gregor Henry from holding the fifth home team try to win.
Still-Game Star Seems Ready to Start a New Career in the Restaurant Industry
Still Game star Ford Kiernan appears to be ready to move into the accommodation and catering sector after he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old man plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC comedy, writing and acting alongside his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duet has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the final season of this show, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Kraiglang.
According to official data, he became the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the fact, although Scottish Sun sources suggested Kiernan was looking for ways to get involved in Glasgow's "blossoming restaurant business."
'We own the sea': Bolivia, imprisoned on land, hopes that the court will once again open the way to the ocean
Sailors patrol the navy headquarters of La Pase.
On public buildings, the blue flag of the ocean is hoisted.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are decorated with the slogan: “We legitimately own the sea.
“Recovering it is our duty.”
Throughout land-locked Bolivia, there are still vivid memories of access to the ocean, which in the bloody conflict of the nineteenth century had to be donated to Chile for resources – alive and longing once again enchanted in the Pacific Ocean.
The hopes cherished in recent decades have now been greatly intensified as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice, which will be announced on October 1.
“Bolivia is focused on the spirit of unity and peace and, of course, hopes to achieve positive results,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivian citizens across the country will be watching the announcement of the ICC’s decision on big screens in the hope that the Hague tribunal will take a positive decision on Bolivia’s complaint – Chile will be obliged to negotiate Bolivia’s state access to the sea.
Evo Morales, a charismatic Bolivian Indian president awaiting a controversial election battle over re-election, is also keen to see how Monday's decision ends.
“We are very close to the possibility of returning to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts tend to think that the court is unlikely to make a favorable decision for Bolivia – even if it did, little would change.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no power to determine Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not determine the possible outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that the ICC decision will be announced only six months after the last arguments were heard hardly indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, an expert on Chilean international law.
And even if Bolivia managed to make some headway, the last four years could have knocked it back.
"This issue of access to the sea has been raised illegally by the current Bolivian administration," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
She believes that any remnants of Chile’s goodwill were destroyed by Morales’ rhetoric of vengeance.
Bolivia and Chile will have extended the conversation at some point, but after all this will be extremely difficult to discuss.
The country has not changed ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, objected to the idea that the court's decision was taken unusually quickly.
"On Monday, Bolivia will have an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile and to end the 139-year-long disagreements for mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales is still one of the most popular Latin American presidents, and uses the issue of the sea as a political manipulation.
“Bolivia will never renounce the right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“A decision is an opportunity to see that we have to reconcile with the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the U.S.
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, has said his people will never give up nuclear weapons first if they can’t trust Washington.
He spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep its promises, which were agreed by the leaders of rival countries at a meeting in Singapore.
His comments came at a time when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be planning to resume stalled nuclear diplomacy more than three months after his meeting with Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says the "utopian dream" is that if the sanctions continue and the U.S. refuses to declare an end to the Korean war, North Korea could ever be parked.
Washington refuses to accept the declaration unless Pyongyang first takes credible disarmament action.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold a second meeting.
But there is a widespread skepticism that Pyongyang does not seriously intend to abandon the arsenal, which the country seems to see as its sole guarantor of security.
Pompeo is set to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the ground for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion show has revealed that the latest trend is massive headgear, and they will quickly conquer the nearest fashion stores
If you want to complement your hat collection or completely protect yourself from the sun, this trend is just for you.
Designers Valentino and Thomas Browne presented a wide range of eccentric headgear in their 2019 spring and summer collections, and he simply captivated Paris Fashion Week spectators with his style.
These particularly impractical hats conquered the social network Instagram this summer and these designers presented eye-catching works on the podium.
Valentino's standout work was a huge body-colored hat, decorated with a wide, feather-like edge, enveloping the head of the dummy.
Other non-standard-sized accessories included pebbled watermelons, a wizard’s hat, and even pineapple — but they’re not designed to protect your head from the cold.
Thomas Browne also unveiled a collection of strange masks – at the same time to Halloween.
Many colorful masks were sewn with lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than high fashion.
One of the works looked like a member’s costume, with a tube and underwater glasses, and the other resembled a melted ice.
And if you’re having sex with this huge fashion trend – don’t ask.
Style experts speculate that these huge covers can get into stores.
The huge hats were popularized with La Bomba high heels, straw hats with two-foot edges were already worn by everyone – from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand, which created extremely impractical hats that conquered all social networks, released on the podium another huge work – a straw beach bag, almost the same size as the one wearing it in a swimsuit.
Red brick raffia bag, decorated with raffia cubes and white leather handle, has become an outstanding highlight of the Jacquemus collection "La Riviera SS19" during Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I think that huge hats and beach bags will come to the stores next summer because the designer has made such a big impact, so it would be hard to ignore the need for non-standard sized accessories.”
John Edwards: “Skills in languages are essential for the citizens of the world”
Scottish independent schools have improved academic achievement records by not dropping out in 2018, and have once again demonstrated outstanding exam results that have only been further enhanced by individual and collective achievements in the fields of sport, art, music and other community merit.
With a total of more than 30,000 pupils studying throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the highest level of service to their pupils and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and to be citizens of the world.
Working in the education sector, which can create and implement a planned school program, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and chosen willingly in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you can speak to a person in a language he understands, he will understand you in his mind.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will speak to his heart."
It is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
Based on the results of this year’s recent exams, we can say that languages excel at the top of popularity and have the best maintenance ratings in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of foreign language learners received the highest A rating.
Data collected from 74 schools that are SCIS members showed that 72 percent of students received the highest A rating during the Mandarin language exam, 72 percent of German language learners received the highest A rating, as well as 69 percent of those who learn Spanish and 63 percent of those who learn Spanish received the highest A rating.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland consider foreign language learning to be an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages, as an elective subject, are now considered as important as basic subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school programs and elsewhere.
According to a survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014, 17 percent of all the reasons that made it difficult for employers to fill jobs were insufficient language skills.
As a result, language skills are becoming increasingly mandatory for young people to be prepared for their future careers.
Since employment opportunities will depend heavily on languages in the future, these skills are becoming essential in a globalizing world.
No matter what career a person chooses when teaching a second language, in the future he will be far superior to others if he has these lifelong skills.
By being able to communicate directly with people from abroad, a person who learns several languages will be much more competitive.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adults, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to participate in a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage of people, i.e. 15 percent.
That’s why investing in language learning is important for today’s children.
By learning several languages, especially in developing countries, children will have better opportunities for meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school differs according to the languages it teaches.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be the most important for the UK, looking to the future of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interests, there will always be plenty of languages to choose from in an independent school with teaching staff and specialists in the field.
Scottish independent schools are ready to create such a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the necessary skills to live in the future.
It is undeniable that in today's global business environment, languages remain vital for the future of the country, and therefore it is necessary to reflect this in the education system.
Indeed, modern languages should certainly be regarded as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this opportunity of choice, diversity and outcomes to Scottish youth.
This must be done.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron to debut at the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
Fans have little to wait to see LeBron James start the season at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James is playing in the opening game of Sunday's season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes you play, it is not yet clear.
"It will be more than one and less than 48 minutes," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said on Twitter that James was likely to play for a limited time.
Earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers in six pre-season games.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to get ready,” he said.
A short talk in West Virginia, on the YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting his campaign tonight in Wilkinson, West Virginia.
This is the first of five planned speeches by Trump next week, including stalls in friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the approval of his Supreme Court nominee’s suspension procedure, Trump is seeking to rally support in the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans face the threat of losing control in November’s vote in Congress.
Will there be a short speech this evening in West Virginia and how to watch it online?
A short speech in Wilmington, West Virginia, scheduled for 7 p.m. Eastern time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's speech in West Virginia online on the following YouTube broadcast.
Short is likely to touch on this week’s Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s theme as it sowed a lot of tension over suspicions of sexual misconduct when the Senate voted to suspend the nominee for a period of up to a week before the FBI conducts an investigation.
But the main goal of this campaign is to help Republicans gain some strength as the November elections approach.
Trump’s campaign officials say the goal of the five meetings next week is to “energize volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to defend and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
"Congressional control is so important on his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible because the very hot season of the campaign is beginning," a Trump campaign spokesman said, reluctant to reveal his name.
"The speech planned at the Wesbanco Arena in Wilkinson tonight should attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw Pittsberg's media attention," Metro News said in a statement.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in a month, a state where he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Senate candidate, Republican Patrick Morrisey, who is in the ratings lows, according to polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president had to come in to push him to the top of the rankings," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, said in a statement.
2018 Ryder Cup Tournament: U.S. team is wary and hopes to enter Sunday's unit competition
After three personal stages on Saturday afternoon, the quartet could be just what was needed during this Ryder Cup tournament.
Such a variation of success is completely contrived, but players do believe in it, especially in competitions like this.
So on whose side is success now?
“They came first with six points, and now with four, so I guess we can think of it as some kind of success,” Spieth said in preparation for the day.
Of course, Europe leads, has a four-point overweight and is still waiting for twelve matches.
The enthusiasm of the Americans, Spieth says, has faded, and they do not lack it, not to mention the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each collected three points out of four.
Spieth was invincible from start to finish and led impeccably.
As the round continued, those wild victories became more and more famous. To finish the fourth match in a tie, Thomas earned two points out of two possible.
His win over them in the 15th hole was accompanied by similar slogans, which seemed to say that the end of the American team was not yet imminent.
“You just have to focus and take care of your own competitions,” Spieth said.
Now each of these players has to play separately.
Towards the end, there are 18 holes.
The only players to score more points for Spieth and Thomas over the past few days are Francesco Molinaris and Tommy Fleetwood, an undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
Weird, but charming couple from Europe collected four points out of four possible and can be calm.
Moliwood was the only couple who needed additional blows not only on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning.
That turn of events and the reaction of the gloomy viewers only confirms that they will be the players who will win on Sunday, and no one else will be able to achieve such popularity as Fleetwood or Molinari, who, after the last rays of the descending sun in Europe, have been unveiled at Le Golf National.
It would be good to have both at the same time in different wells.
It’s too early to talk about Europe’s glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefly played with Sergio Garcia, the eastern four-ball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
An additional blow and two double additional blows during the first nine-hole series pushed the Spanish and Swedish into trouble, from which they were unable to escape.
No one will get out of trouble on Sunday.
Four balls and four matches are so interesting to watch because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give and the advice they don’t give, and the fact that the strategy can change instantly.
Europe played better as a team, so it came decisively in the final, but this fourth stage also showed that the US team has a fighter's back, which some, especially in the states, doubted.
The last day of the Ryder Cup is ahead of Europe 10:6
Europe on the last day of the Ryder Cup will have a heavy overweight, after Saturday's fourth leg, leading the United States with a score of 10:6.
The inspiring duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinario continued to warm the atmosphere by winning two victories against the hard-fought Tiger Woods and leading Le Golf National by four points.
Thomas Bjorn’s European side, to save the trophies he had lost to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the morning quarterfinals against the unsuccessful American side and finished the stage 3-1.
The U.S. showed more resistance in the fours when it won two games but failed to overcome the points overweight
Jim Fury's half needs eight points from Sunday's 12-unit match to keep the trophies in their hands.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row after Molinari doubled Molliwood after a sensational weekend, and they are only the second pair to win four points in their first four games in the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fours, they flawlessly shattered the confidence of losing Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even better score of 5:4.
Woods, who has not so far outstripped two Saturday games, has shown a high level of professionalism at some points, but has already lost 19 and 29 of his games in fours, seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose rested at four o'clock in the morning and returned to play with his partner Henrik Stenson at four o'clock; they beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka 2&1 to take first and third place in the world rankings.
Despite the pleasant, gentle breeze of a day in the south-west of Paris, Europe did not go through everything like butter.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas raised the cartel to the Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
In the four-ball match, they won an awkward 2:1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahma and Ian Poulter, and in the fourth match, they beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with a 4:3 victory without hitting the ball in the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team managed to recover a four-point lead in singles, although Fury's half would be equal to keep the trophies.
Although two days were in second place, on Sunday success from them seems to have turned around.
North Korea says it will in no way disarm unilaterally without being able to trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions deepened their distrust of the United States and that the country would certainly not unilaterally give up nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly that North Korea has taken “marked measures of goodwill” in recent years, such as halting nuclear missile tests, dismantling its nuclear test base and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technologies.
“We have not received a similar response from the United States,” he said.
“Without any trust in the United States, we will not be able to rely on our national security, and under such circumstances, we will by no means be the first to unilaterally disarm.”
While Ri has repeatedly heard complaints from North Korea about Washington's opposition to a phased approach to nuclear disarmament that would reward North Korea in stages of action, his statement stood out by the fact that he had not completely rejected the idea of a bilateral pact.
Ri pointed to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first meeting of the US President and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work on “disarmament of the Korean Peninsula” and Trump promised to ensure North Korea’s security.
North Korea is aiming for a formal end to the 1950-1953 Korean war, but the United States says that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington also refuses to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States demands nuclear disarmament first and increases the pressure of sanctions to achieve its goal by coercive methods, even by renouncing declarations of an end to the war,” Ri said.
“To think that we can be stalked by sanctions is the same thing as having utopian dreams for people we don’t care about.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions deepen our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader underscored at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister emphasized three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months: “If South Korea were the other country on the issue of nuclear disarmament, and not the US, the issue of nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula would not have been so acute.”
However, the tone of Ri’s speech has changed dramatically compared to last year when he told the UN General Assembly that when “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “missile master” preparing a suicide mission, steering North Korea’s missiles into the U.S. was absolutely not.
Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea at the United Nations, lauded Kim for the courage to take steps towards disarmament, but said much still needed to be done and that sanctions must remain until the North's nuclear-defense demands are met.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timeline for it, saying that "if it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia said the UN Security Council should pay Pyongyang back for what it has done.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pomeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "the Security Council's sanctions must be resolutely pursued without any concessions until a full and definitive, evidence-confirmed nuclear disarmament is carried out."
The Security Council has voted in favour of sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to prevent the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri in the backdrop of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to pave the way for the next meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip was unsuccessful.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying all the progress was only to get North Korea to announce a few hours later that he had made "gangsterous demands."
North Korea pledged to dismantle the missile base and nuclear complex at a meeting with Moon this month if the United States takes "appropriate measures."
According to him, Kim claimed that the “corresponding measures” he sought were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and a shift to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students are learning enough to rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year encouraged all of its students to sleep more, in order to combat the growing culture of macho studies, consuming caffeine and not sleeping at night.
One academic found that at the best university in the world, students often don’t even have the basic knowledge to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Brigham City, a specialist in women's hospitals, have developed a course that he says is the first of its kind in the United States.
The inspiration for preparing this course came after a talk about the effects of lack of sleep on learning.
“At the end of the speech, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why am I only being told about this now, in my last year of college?’
She said that no one had told her about the importance of sleep, and that surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course is offered for the first time this year. It explains to students how the most important quality sleep habits help to achieve academic and sporting results, improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University's health services department, said the university had decided to offer the course when it turned out that students were severely sleep-deprived during the week.
The hour-long course includes a series of interactive tasks.
One section contains a photo of the dormitory room where students can click on a cup of coffee, curtains, workouts and books to learn about the effects of caffeine, light, how sleep deprivation affects sports performance, and how important a walking sleep routine is.
In the next section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A student campus map with interactive icons that encourage participants to reflect on their daily routines.
“We understand that this will not immediately change the behavior of the students.
But we think they have a right to know – just like you have a right to know about the health consequences when you choose to smoke,” explained Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride not sleeping at night, according to him, still exists. Modern technologies and the increasing pressure on students have led to the problem of growing lack of sleep.
“To make sure you get enough and quality sleep, there should be a student’s secret weapon in combating stress, exhaustion and anxiety,” he said, “even avoiding weight gain because sleep deprivation switches the brain into starvation mode, so students are constantly hungry.”
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler prepare a course when he attended one of the subjects he taught at Harvard in his first year last year.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to apply for a course available to the entire campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to invite all postgraduate students to listen to this course before starting to attend this competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set an alarm clock when it’s time to go to sleep, just like waking up, and guard against the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic devices and LED lighting, as they can knock your circadian rhythm out of the way.
Livingston 1:0 Rangers: Menga's shot saddened Gerrard's men
The Rangers experienced yet another disappointment when Dolly Mengai Livingstone managed to beat the weakened Steven Gerrard 1-0.
Ibrox had hoped to win their first victory after a 4-1 victory in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team beat Gerrard for the second time in the 18-game head office and now the latter's team is eight points behind the far-distant "premi<0xC3><0xA8>res".
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, but without inspiration, Rangers didn't see any chance to equalize the result.
The Rangers have now fallen to sixth, Livingston has risen to third, and are behind Hibernian by only one inning.
And Rangers' worries don't end there, because it's likely that a piece of tribune butter hit side judge Calum Spenc in the head and injured him.
Gerrard made four changes that allowed him to bypass Ayr and lead to the semi-finals of the Bettfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt trusted the same monk who took a point from Hearts last week, and he would have liked how his well-thought-out combinations rattled opponents at every turn.
The Rangers dominated control of the ball, but Livingston did more with it.
They could have hit the ball as early as the second minute when Menga passed the ball close to Allan McGregor's goal to Scott Pittman, but security thwarted his chance by pointing the ball away from the goal.
After a distant Keaghan Jacobs free kick, the ball reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his team-mate defender Alan Lithgowa asked across the country.
The Rangers took control, but the last third of the game was just a game of hope, not a game of faith.
For the remaining fifteen minutes, Alfredo Morelos thought he deserved a fine when he faced Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson dropped his hand to the Colombian's complaints.
The Rangers only managed to hit Ibrox's former goalkeeper Liam Kelly twice in the first inning, but it was unlikely Lassana Coulibaly's headshot or Ovie Ejaria's gentle parenditure would have frightened him.
While the 34th minute of the game may not have matched the game, no one will argue that they deserved it for their efforts alone.
The Rangers again failed to beat Jacobs's tough defense.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher handed the ball to Scott Robinson, who retained his nickname and handed it to Menga for an easy finish.
During the break, Gerrard took action to replace Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and that change almost immediately yielded fruit when the country's security tampered with Morelos, but impressingly played Kelly's escape stalled the blow.
Livingston brought guests into the game they loved, with long-distance transfers of Lithgowo and Halkett's ball.
Holt's team was able to increase their overweight in the end, but McGregor defended against Jacobs after Lithgow's submission from the corner.
Rangers player Glenn Middleton appealed again at the end of the game for a fine after a collision with Jacobs, but Thomson again disregarded it.
Almanach: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now the page from our Sunday Morning almanac: on September 30, 1882, today it is already 136 years ago and MORE... On that day in Germany was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm (Hans) Geiger.
Geiger invented a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity. The invention, according to which a device was later developed, known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, this device has become a science world hit, and later a popular cultural hit, when in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, the not-so-reminiscent scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played cowboys:
Man: “What the hell is that?”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you turn on these headphones, you can actually hear how atoms work, touch the radioactive effects of minerals."
Evans: “Hey, now it’s really shooting!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that got its name lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach the Immune System to See Bad Cells
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach the Immune System to See Bad Cells and Kill Them
Vaccine Learned the Immune System to Recognize Bad Cells – This Is Part of the Treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their replacement in the laboratory
The cells can then “see” the proteins that are characteristic of many forms of cancer and are then re-injected back into the body.
The experimental vaccine has yielded promising results in the treatment of patients with various forms of cancer.
In one woman treated with this vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting the immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory, then the cells can see the proteins characteristic of HER2 cancer and are re-injected back.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
“HER2 promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovaries, lungs and rectum,” Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach, when immune cells are extracted from patients and taught to settle into cancer cells, has been successfully applied in the treatment of leukaemia.
Kanye West launched a supportive tirade by wearing a MAGA hat after his appearance on the SNL show.
I'm glad it didn't end
After the relentless performance of the Saturday Night Live studio, viewers embarrassed Kanye West, who praised U.S. President Donald Trump; he said he would take part in the 2020 campaign.
That night, performing the third song "Ghost Town" in which he wore a hat with the inscription "Make America Great", he continued to condemn the Democrats and expressed support for Trump.
“How many times have I had to talk to white people, they said, ‘How can you like Short, he’s a racist?’
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL show began with a comedic scene in which Matt Damon whispered from Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee over allegations of sexual misconduct by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the footage with West's replicas was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to rip West out of this tape.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had problems behind the scenes with his head covering.
“They were laughing at me in the back.
He said don't go in there with a hat like that.
They were making fun of me!
They said I had reached the bottom,” he told the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see what the bottom is? <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> He asked. <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> Wearing your superman’s hat means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to live?
Start to love.”
His speeches caused at least twice inconsistencies in the audience and members of the SNL broadcast seemed dismayed, Variety reports. One man told the media: "There was a deadly silence throughout the studio."
West was asked to urgently replace singer Ariana Grande after her former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confuses many with his performance, during which he performed the song "I Love It" while wearing a Perrier bottle suit.
He received the support of the conservative group TPUSA leader Candace Turner, who posted on Twitter the post: "For one of the bravest of spirits: HERE TO REPRESENT MINIONS."
But talk show host Karen Hunter posted a post on her Twitter account stating that West was simply “being himself and that’s incredibly amazing.”
“But I choose NOT to be a man (by buying his music or his clothes, or by supporting his ‘art’) whose beliefs are a poisonous ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
But we are also free,” she added.
Before the show began, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and is now formally known as Kanye West.
He was not the first creator to change his name, but went the same way that Diddy had already gone, also known by the names Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg was originally called Snoop Lion; music legend Prince changed his name to a character and later became known as Prince.
Allegations of murder by knife attack at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with manslaughter when he was wounded with a knife in Belfast on Friday.
According to police, the incident took place in Baliakamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast magistrates' court on Monday.
The prosecution will review the allegations.
Star of the Sixth Wars: Harington Criticizes Distorted Approach to Maledom
Another Harington has become famous as a sword-wielding character in HBO’s fantastic adventure series about medieval Sosto Wars.
But the 31-year-old actor criticizes the stereotype of a macho hero. He claims that such on-screen roles often make young boys feel as if they have to be tough to be respected.
Speaking to the Sunday Times Culture, the other said that he believes “something is wrong” and raised the question of how to combat the problem of perverted masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Another, who recently married a 31-year-old fellow Star of the Cold War, Rose Leslie, admitted that the topic “has a strong impact” on him.
“I feel that this topic is really touching me now. Where did we make a mistake in developing masculinity?” he asked.
“What do we teach growing men to face such problems?”
Another believes that, in part, this wave of distorted masculinity could be responsible for television, because it creates very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is natural, and what is learned?
What is being taught on television or on the street so that young people are convinced that this type of masculinity must be distinguished?
I think this is one of the most important questions of our time – how can we change this?
“We’ve made a mistake with young people.”
In an interview, he also confirmed that he would not take part in any prehistory or sequels of the "Sosto Wars" when the series ends next summer, and said that "he already has enough battlefields and horses."
From November, Next will be filming Sam Shepard's "True West" in a modern version. It is a film about the movie director and his brother's robber.
The actor recently revealed the best thing that happened to him during the creation of the Sosto Wars, where he met his wife Rose.
"In this series, I met my wife, so in this sense, the series gave me a future family and a future life," he said.
In an Emmy-winning fantasy series, Rose starred as Igrita, the object of John Snow’s love for another character.
The couple married in June 2018 at a property owned by the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases of the disease
China reports a 14% increase in the number of citizens infected with HIV and AIDS.
According to the health authorities, more than 820,000 people have been infected with the infection in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most newly infected people have been sexually transmitted, and this is different from past statistics.
Traditionally, HIV infection has spread rapidly in some parts of China due to the transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people infected with HIV has dropped to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Junan province.
However, over time, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased to 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a sensitive issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality in China has been decriminalized since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
With conservative values prevalent in the country, 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with men eventually marry a woman.
Most cases of infection with this disease occur due to inadequate protective measures during such sexual intercourse.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medicines as one of the ways to combat the problem.
Maxine Waters denies employees leaked Republican senator's data, denounces "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denied suspicions that one of her employees had published personal information about three Republican U.S. senators on the Wikipedia pages of lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the allegations were made by ultra-right-wing experts and websites.
“Lie, lie, and again a nasty lie,” Waters said on Twitter.
The leaked information included addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, announced by an unknown person from the Capitol Hill at a time when the Senate was facing charges of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leaked information appeared a little later when these three senators put questions to Kavanaugh.
“Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address by which the source of these records was identified is related to the Waters office and Waters employee information has been disclosed,” the statement said.
“These unfounded suspicions are absolutely false and absolute lies,” Waters continued.
“A member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been affected by these fraudulent and false suspicions, is in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
These unfounded suspicions are absolutely false and absolute lies.”
Waters' statement quickly received criticism online, including from former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer.
“This denial sounds bad,” Fleischer wrote.
“It says she doesn’t have enough self-esteem to be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of things he has not done, he should not be angry.
He shouldn't defend.
He should not doubt the motives of the accused.
He should be calm and humble.”
Fleischer seems to have tried to compare Waters’ reaction to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing too angry at Thursday’s hearing.
Republican nominee Omar Navarro, who is part of a midterm campaign to replace Waters, also voiced his views on Twitter.
“True, if not false,” he wrote.
In its statement, Waters said that its office had informed the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies of these false accusations.
“We will make sure that the organizers are clear, <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> she continued, <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> that they are legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all without exception to my employees.”
Review of the comedy “Johnny English Smugs Again” – a breathtaking spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
Already the tradition has become to look for Brexit hints in any British film. The same seems to be said about the revival of the action spy comedy franchise "Johnny English" – "Johnny English" was launched in 2003, and in 2011 in an episode of "The Comedy of the Year" in the comic again.
Will this sarcastic self-satisfaction about how we have obviously become a new opportunity for national exports?
In any case, the incompetent John English has a second chance to bring to the surface unpleasant truths with wide eyes and a rubbery face <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> after all, the name itself clearly shows that this work of comedy is intended for non-English speaking regions of the cinema.
Of course, this silly undercover agent, who, although he has claims to luxury, has also acquired a bit of Inspector Clouseau's qualities, a bit of Mr. Byn's traits and a slap in the face of that guy, hints at the ceremonies in which he was used in a ceremony at the 2012 London Olympics.
He is also somewhat based on the character of the traveler and the mysterious man who caused the chaos that Atkinson once played in a now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial.
In this latest John English film, there are a few beautiful moments.
I liked it when John English approached the helicopter, wearing a medieval suit and armor, and the artillery rotor hit his helmet.
Comedian Atkinson’s talent is obvious, but the humor itself seems exhilarating and strangely exaggerated, especially when serious movie brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible boldly insert elements of the comedy.
Humor is more for children than for adults, and I don't think the adventures of John English are as inventive and pertinent as Atkinson's silent laughter playing Mr. Bynna.
The most common issue at the moment is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has successfully hacked into Britain’s highly secretive spy network and revealed the identities of all British spies in the area, causing the agent’s outrage – an overly insignificant role played by Kevin Eldon.
It’s the last drop in the prime minister’s cup, a pompous and cornered character who already suffers from a crushing political unpopularity: Emma Thompson of Teresa May expresses everything she can, but in the script there is little good material for it.
Wise advisers inform her that the identity of all her agents has been revealed and that she will have to search for people among those who retire.
This means that you have to turn to John Inglesh himself, who is currently working as a school director at some fancy institution, but who provides illegal lessons on how to work as a secret agent. Here were some good jokes when the English offered the School of Rock type.
The Englishman is sent back to Whitehall to discuss the emergency and there he meets his longtime companion, Bough, who is again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine captain, and Vicki Pepperdine, a high-class girl, seems to be underutilized.
So Batman and Robin, able to confuse all matters in Her Majesty's secret service, take action again and meet Olga Kurylenko playing the fatal beautiful Ophelia Buletova.
A charismatic billionaire who says he can solve the problem of British computers, Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy, is turning the prime minister’s head in a dangerous fashion.
Englishman and Bough begin their odyssey: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant, wreak havoc on a luxury Volta yacht, and Englishman begins a complete anarchy, trying to take advantage of virtual reality headsets to get to know Volta's house.
All the stopwatches were clearly retained for this last series, but no matter how pleasant or wild, all this is reminiscent of children's television.
Quite average.
As with other John English films, I couldn’t get rid of the thought: the growing British film industry can’t give Rowan Atkinson a role that would really be worth his talent?
Labour denies making a plan for British workers to work four days a week, but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party plans to consider a radical plan that would allow the British to work four days a week, but pay a five-day wage.
It is reported that the party wants company executives to share savings accumulated due to the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution, giving its employees one day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend and bring home the same amount of pay.
The source says the idea fits the party's economic agenda and plans to steer the country's development in a workers-friendly direction.
The transition to the four-day week was also welcomed by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for employees to take advantage of the benefits of the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “The revision of the policy is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight, but the four-day week corresponds to the party's approach to economic balance for the benefit of the workers, as well as the general strategy of the party's industry."
The Labour Party is not the first to promote this idea; the Greens also promised a four-day week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, not the entire Labour Party supports this idea at the moment.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not party policy and is not considered in the party."
Shadow government spokesman John McDonnell took the opportunity at last week’s Labour Party conference to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to reclaim power from “immobile dictators” and “profit hunters” in utility companies.
Such shadow Chancellor’s plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not recover their full share because, seeing the wrongdoing done, the Labour government can deduct something.
It also approved plans to include employees on the company’s board and create inclusive equity funds to transfer 10 percent of the capital of private sector companies to employees, and they could receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 annual dividends.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy answer 60 Minutes question on whether an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their mind
The FBI's investigation into the charges brought against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has put a final vote on whether to refer him to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising the question of whether the facts clarified by the Bureau of Investigation could affect the opinion of some Republican senators in a way that they no longer care about this.
Scott Pelley, the 60 Minutes correspondent for Sunday's broadcast, asks Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it could happen that the FBI would find out something that would change their minds.
Senator Kennedy seems to have a more liberal approach than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Well, yes, of course,” Kennedy replied.
“As I said at the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
When that happened, when these accusations came up, I called him and asked, “Did you do that?”
He replied decisively, firmly, unequivocally."
So, Mr. Graham’s view does not seem to change anything.
“I have decided on Bretto Kavanaugh, there should be some really shocking accusations,” he said.
“For Dr. Ford, I don’t know what was there, but I know one thing: Brett categorically denies it,” Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“No one who calls it can confirm it.
It's been 36 years.
I don’t think anything new will come out.”
What is the World Citizens’ Festival and has it contributed to reducing poverty in any way?
This Saturday, New York City will host the World Citizens’ Festival, an annual music event featuring an impressive number of stars and aiming at an equally impressive goal – to eradicate poverty in the world.
For the seventh year in a row, the World Citizens’ Festival will be attended by tens of thousands of people who will not only listen to stars like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but will also spread the word about the true purpose of the event – to eliminate the di in particular by 2030.
The World Citizens’ Festival was launched in 2012 as a continuation of the World Anti-Poverty Project, an international mediation group that hopes to eradicate poverty by actively increasing the number of people fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you wanted to purchase a paid VIP ticket), the concert visitors had to perform various tasks or actions, such as volunteering, sending an email to the world leader, calling for help or any other form of help.
But are the citizens of the world successfully achieving this goal? There are 12 years left before the deadline.
Will the idea of paying people for a free concert really convince them to demand and encourage them to act? Perhaps this is just another example of so-called kliktivism, fictitious activism – people think that it will really change the situation by signing an online petition or posting a post on Twitter.
According to the organizers of the World Citizens’ Festival, since 2011, the movement has recorded more than 19 million actions by its sponsors that promote the achievement of a wide range of goals.
They say that, under pressure from these actions, world leaders have announced $37 billion in commitments and policy strategies that are expected to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group identified 390 commitments and statements triggered by the group’s actions, of which at least $10 billion have already been disbursed or raised.
According to the group’s calculation, the secured funds have already directly affected almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based investor-entrepreneur partnership aimed at “helping children grow and unlock their full potential.” After receiving more than 4,700 questions from the world’s citizens on Twitter, Rudkani said:
“With the support of the UK government, sponsors, governments of countries, and people like you, we can achieve social injustice such as nutritional insufficiency to become a thing of the past,” said Tracey Ullman, the U.K.’s ambassador to the United Kingdom for nutrition power.
The group also said that after receiving 5,000 appeals calling for improved nutrition for mothers and children in the United Kingdom, the government announced funding for the Nutrition Power project, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the FAQs on his website, which asks, “Why do you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?”,
The world’s citizens respond: “This is a long and difficult road – sometimes we will shut up and experience failures.
But like the great movements for human rights and against apartheid, we will win because we are all stronger together.”
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the performers who will take part in this year's event in New York. The event will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
Home Secretary Says U.S. May Use Fleet Blockades to Block Russian Energy Exports
"If necessary, Washington can use a fleet to prevent Russia's energy from reaching the markets, as well as the markets of the Middle East," U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke said in a statement.
Zinke argues that Russia’s involvement in Syria, especially when it acts at the invitation of legitimate authorities, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think Russia is interfering in the Middle East because it wants to regulate the energy sector the way it does in Eastern Europe, in Southern Europe,” Zinke said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve this issue.
“The United States can do that with a fleet, it can make sure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, it can block, it can make sure that their energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke told attendees at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group calling the United States “the voice of energy consumers.”
He went on to compare Washington’s methods with those used in dealing with issues related to Russia and Iran, and noted that they are essentially the same.
“The economic alternative for Iran and Russia is to find a greater or lesser balance that would replace fuel,” he said, calling Russia a country whose entire economy depends solely on fossil fuels.
These statements appeared to the Trump administration on a mission to increase its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe and replace Russia in the market, offering a much cheaper option for European consumers.
Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to pull out of the inappropriate Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a prisoner of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is only an economic project.
According to the Kremlin, the reason for Washington’s fierce opposition to this project is purely economic, it will be an example of unfair competition.
"I think we all agree that energy cannot be a means of pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has received hostile reactions from Germany, which has reaffirmed its determination to continue the project.
The main German industrial organization, the German Industrial Federation (BDI), called on the US not to interfere in the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I certainly do not agree with the third country’s interference in our energy supply issues,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), after the recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren says she is seriously considering lifting her candidacy during 2020 presidential election
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she was seriously considering running for president after a midterm election.
At a meeting in Hollywood, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering a candidate.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to deal with our failed government, and they have to go to the top," she said.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider whether to participate in the presidential elections.”
During a meeting in the city hall, Warren pointed President Donald Trump, saying he was leading the country in the wrong direction.
“I’m very afraid of how Donald Trump treats our democracy,” she said.
Warren openly criticizes Trump and his proposed Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet released on Friday, Warren said that "until the vote, there is no doubt there is a need to conduct an FBI investigation."
But a poll released on Thursday shows that a majority of Warren’s own voters believe she should not run for president in 2020.
According to a poll conducted by the University of Suffolk’s Center for Political Research and the Boston Globe, 58 percent of likely Massachusetts voters say the senator should not take part in the election.
Thirty-two percent support her candidacy.
The poll showed that former governor Deval Patrick received more support, with 38 per cent supporting his possible candidacy and 48 per cent opposing it.
The names of representatives of the Democratic Party that emerged in 2020 were former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden says he will make a formal decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
At Donald Trump's rally, Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin's post-traumatic disorder
Track Palin, 26, who joined the military in September, spent a year in Iraq.
In the aftermath of a domestic violence incident on Monday night, he was arrested and charged.
“I see what my son is going through, what he is facing as he returns to his daily routine, so I understand other families who are feeling the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder, and some of the injuries our soldiers are coming back with,” she told reporters at Donald Trump’s rally in Tallahassee, Ohio.
Palin called his arrest avoidable truth. She said that the son and other war veterans "return a little changed, they return a more hardened heart, they return doubting whether they will receive respect for what their fellow soldiers are their own soldiers and bowmen, and all of them
He was arrested in Washington, D.C., on Monday on charges of domestic violence and assault against a woman, as well as charges of obstruction of reporting domestic violence with a gun and intoxication, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Washington Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support resistance to the new policy of asylum seekers
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims of gang violence or domestic violence.
Washington, D.C., on Friday, 18 states and representatives from the district submitted comments to amicus curiae (a court adviser) to support a dispute over asylum-seekers' policies, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff’s full name is not disclosed in the Grace v. Sessions trial, which the American Civil Liberties Union launched against federal policy.
She says her partner "and members of his criminal gang" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Grace-backed state lawyers have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which the United States receives many asylum applications as states plagued by persistent gang violence and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy repealed a 2014 Immigration Appeals Board decision that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "is without prejudice to decades-old state, federal and international laws."
“Under federal law, decisions on asylum applications are required to be made taking into account the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such an injunction violates this principle,” Amicus Curiae said in a statement.
In the note, lawyers also say that policies prohibiting immigrants from entering the country harm the U.S. economy, and that immigrants are more likely to do business and “provide the necessary labor services.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered judges who ruled on immigration issues to no longer provide asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence fleeing.
“Asylum is granted to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear related to race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or certain political views,” Sessions said in a June 11 policy statement.
Asylum has never been intended to solve all the problems (not all the serious problems) that people face every day around the world.
Doubling the death toll in Palu, desperately searching for survivors
The situation of the survivors is constantly deteriorating.
“The tension is very high,” 35-year-old Risa Kusuma says, as she soothes her febrile grandson in the evacuation center of the city of Palu.
“There are more and more bodies being transported.
There is a lack of clean water.”
It has been observed that residents return to their broken homes, collect stuff stuffed with water, try to save whatever they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and 7.5-point earthquake hospitals were damaged.
Some of the injured, like Dwi Harry, who suffered a fracture in the back and shoulders, lie outside Palu Army Hospital, where patients are treated outdoors for severe repetitive strokes.
His eyes twitch with tears as he tells how he felt a severe earthquake in the fifth-floor room of the hotel where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save others.
It seems to me that I have broken through the ruins of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that he and his family had come to the city to attend the wedding.
“I heard my wife’s cry for help, and then she kept quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and her daughter.
I hope they are healthy.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of Intimidating Propaganda
A week later, when an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in the U.S. newspaper, pledging mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday cited a paid addition to Iowa's best-selling newspaper, the Des Moines Register, and accused China of influencing the November 6 U.S. congressional election.
“Trump’s accusation that Beijing is trying to influence the US election marks a new stage in Washington’s escalating campaign to pressure China,” US officials told Reuters.
While it’s common for foreign governments to spread advertising to boost trade, Beijing and Washington are currently embroiled in an escalating trade war, and both countries are struggling with tariffs on each other’s imports of goods.
According to Chinese and U.S. experts, China's retaliatory tariffs were imposed on exporters from Iowa and similar countries who supported the Trump Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China, a long-time Iowa governor and one of the largest exporters of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
In an opinion piece published in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, Branstad said China "is making even more jokes by taking up the printing of propaganda advertisements in our free press."
“In spreading propaganda, the Chinese government took advantage of America’s well-respected freedom of speech and press and ordered a paid promotional message to the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“While you won’t find conflicting voices in a local Beijing press booth and you won’t create a real picture of the different views that the Chinese people may have about China’s worrying economic trajectory,” the statement said.
Branstad also added that "one of China's best-known newspapers turned away from the proposal to print" his article, but did not mention which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn: With midterm elections approaching, Kavanaugh’s fiasco deterred Republican voters
While many Republican leaders remain loyal to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has even been accused of sexual harassment, the analyst warned that this would receive a negative response during the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The emotions of the situation are extremely strong, and many Republicans are already officially claiming that they want to carry out the vote.
Such things cannot be taken back later," Grant Reeher, a professor at the University of Syracuse's Maxwell School, told The Hill newspaper on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute calls to launch an FBI investigation would be enough to reassure bad voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will remember it both tomorrow and in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national representative for the progressive group MoveOn, in a statement.
Protesters chanted "April is coming!" during a rally in the Senate lobby when Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee decided to nominate Kavanaugh despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic said.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to go overboard,” Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, told the news site.
“People say she was already strong, and they’re right.
But it could further strengthen positions, especially among undecided female voters in suburban areas and voters under the age of 18-29 who, while disliked by the president, often simply do not vote.”
Even before Ch.B. Ford publicly testified, when she detailed allegations of sexual harassment against a Supreme Court nominee, analysts said that if Republicans approve of the candidacy, it could cause outrage.
"This has caused a lot of confusion for the Republican Party," Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee or the final vote, it’s about whether Kavanaugh will be appointed as a judge, it’s also about how the Republicans handled the situation and how they handled Ch. B. Ford,” Guy Cecil, a group of Democrats who support Priorities USA, told the news channel.
However, it seems that the Americans do not yet agree on what to believe after the statements of B. Kavanaugh and Ch. B. Ford, although she gets a little more support.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents either fully or probably believe Ch. B. Ford’s testimonials, and 35 percent say fully or probably believe B. Kavanaugh’s testimonials.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed that Kavanaugh really or probably lied to the evidence, and only 30 percent said the same thing about Ch. B. Ford.
At Flake’s request, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ch.B. Ford and the testimony of at least one other defendant, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford swore to testify to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, saying Kavanaugh assaulted her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her his genitals at a party they attended while studying at Yale University on the 9th.
Web Inventor Plans to Create New Internet to Oppose Google and Facebook
The inventor of the global network, Tim Berners-Lee, is creating a new startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legendary inventor, Inrupt, is a company whose work is based on the Bernerso-Lee open-source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored, as well as who and what information they have access to.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's goal was to take over the world.
“We have to do it now,” he said of the starter.
It’s a historic moment.”
The application on the basis of Solid technology allows people to create their own personal online data store (POD).
It can include lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal or work tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser at the same time.
The online store of personal data is unique in that only the user decides who and what information can be accessed.
The company calls this personal authorization through data.
According to John Bruce, CEO of Inrupt, the idea behind Inrupt is to provide the resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of T. Berners-Lee, J. Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several programmers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools provided on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team disagreed with Facebook or Google over changes that would turn all business models upside down overnight.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a statement on Wednesday, Berners-Lee said Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the durability and quality of the new Solid-based network."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing a Web Consortium at Massachusetts University of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential opinion in the debate on internet neutrality.
Even working with Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am very optimistic about this new era of the web,” added Berners-Lee.
Honored Bernard Vannas – Pastor awarded Victoria’s Cross in the First World War
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of his birth, the only clergyman of the Anglican Church was honored in his hometown, and during the First World War he was awarded the Victoria Cross as a fighter.
Colonel Lieutenant Pastor Bernard Vannas earned the award during the attack of Belengliz and Luckura on 29 September 1918.
Unfortunately, after four days, the pastor was shot by a sniper, so he remained unaware that he had been awarded a top-level British Army award.
During the parade in Ra<0xC5><0xA1>den, Northamptonshire, two grandchildren unearthed the memorial stone.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said the discovery of the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s award-winning work was “extraordinarily symbolic.”
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, the lieutenant colonel led his battalion through the St. Kent Channel “in the midst of very thick fog, with a sharp simmer of conditions and automaton fire.”
Later, he rushed to the line of fire and "especially powerfully" led the line forward, and then himself attacked the condition and killed three of the team's fighters.
Lieutenant Colonel B. Vanna was shot dead by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vanne, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something that will never be equaled by himself, but at the same time it is an extremely inspiring thing to be humble."
After the parade, led by Brentwood's Imperial Youth Orchestra, Michael and his brother Dr. James Vanne helped with the crown.
Michael Vann said it was a great honor for him to attend the parade, adding: "A true hero's member is shown by the support that many people will give."
MMA enthusiasts did not sleep all night to see Bellator 206, but had to be satisfied with Pig Pepa
Imagine: You don’t go to bed all night to see the bellator 206, but you don’t get to see the main sight.
There were 13 fights on the San Choz poster, six of them on the main card and broadcast live in the United Kingdom all night on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., Gagard Moussai and Rory MacDonald were stunned by the British audience as they prepared for the fight.
Some viewers, to put it mildly, were not impressed, because it was because of this fight that they did not sleep until dawn.
On Twitter, one of the patients called the change of the broadcast a children's animated film "a sick joke."
"According to the rules set by the government, at 6 a.m., such content is not appropriate, so it was necessary to activate a program for children," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications.
"Yes, "Pepper Pig."
Scott Cocker, president of Bellator, said that in the future, there will be efforts to adjust the schedules according to viewers in the United Kingdom.
“When I think about repetition, I think we might be able to do that,” Cocker said.
“But at that time there is 6 o’clock in the morning, Sunday, and we would not be able to solve it until Sunday at our own time – Monday at their own time.
However, we are already working on this.
Believe me, after a change in the broadcast, a lot of messages were exchanged, which were not all friendly.
We tried to correct the situation, we thought it was a technical error.
No, it is not a matter of government.
I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
We will reduce the number of fights to five instead of six – as usual. We wanted to give more to the enthusiasts, but we just failed.
This is an unsuccessful situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels Unappreciated About His Sexual Orientation
Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexual orientation, but this gave him the motivation to pursue success.
24 The athlete said only at the primary school that he realized that he was not the same as everyone else.
For the first time on Lauren Laverne's Radio 4 show, Desert Island Discs, he said he took to public speaking about gay rights because he wanted to give others hope.
He also said that becoming a father was not so important to win the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the regular host of this long-running show, has been out of work for several months due to illness.
In the first show hosted by Laverne, whose guests are asked to imagine traveling to an uninhabited island, Daley said growing up felt inferior to everyone else because it was socially unacceptable to like both boys and girls.
He said: “To this day, that sense of smallness and otherness has been the impetus that has given me the strength to succeed.”
He said he wanted to prove himself worthy of this so that he would not disappoint others when they finally learned of his sexual orientation.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became a high-level LGBT activist and took the opportunity to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality as part of this year’s Games of the League of Nations.
He claimed to have spoken about it in public because he believed he was lucky to be able to live openly without any consequences, so he would like to give others that hope.
The three-time world champion said he was surprised to fall in love with his husband, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married a 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but says the age difference has never caused a problem.
According to Delay, when he survived so much as a young man — at his first Olympics, he was only 14, and three years later his father died of cancer — it’s hard to find someone who was the same age, but experienced the same height and humility.
After the couple became parents to their son Roberto Ray Blacko-Daley in June, Daley’s prospects have completely changed.
“If you had asked me last year, I would have said that the most important thing for me is to win a gold medal,” he said.
“But, you know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
Robis is my Olympic gold medalist.
His name is the same as his grandfather Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
His father, Antoine Daley, did not want to reconcile with death, so one of his last questions was whether he had already bought tickets to the 2012 London Olympics, which he was going to watch while sitting in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him that he wouldn’t live long enough to sit in the front row,” Daley said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only then did I finally admit that he is not inviolable,” Daley said.
A year later, the athlete competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
“I just knew that my whole life I’ve dreamed of jumping into the water watching local spectators at the Olympics – there’s no better feeling,” he said.
It was also inspired by the choice of the first song for the shows – Heather Small’s work “Proud”, which captured his emotions in the Olympics and still pleasantly pampers his skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 a.m.
Ph. Mickelson, who lost his form in Saturday's Ryder Cup tournament, was on the bench.
The American Phil Mickelson will reach a record on Sunday, as he will already participate in the Ryder Cup tournament 47 times, but in order not to become a failure, he will need to greatly improve his form.
Ph. Mickelson, who has already played for the 12th time every two years, was planted on the pitch in Saturday's quarter-finals by Captain Jim Furyk.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as was often the case in the United States, the main winner spent five times the day on the support team, and the rest of the day honed his technique on the pitch in an effort to correct interfering errors.
Even at the height of his career, the 48-athlete is not an ideal player on the steep Le Gold National pitches, whose long stretch of rough grass is extremely unfavourable for inaccurate blows.
Also, as if the pitch itself weren’t scary enough, in the ninth match, which will take place on Sunday, Ph. Mickelson plays against the highly-targeted British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who, along with rookie Tommy Fleetwood, won all four matches this week.
If the four-point-backed Americans manage to start the next 12 games well, Ph. Mickelson’s match can become absolutely decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, but he probably could not speak otherwise.
"He perfectly understood the role he played today, he leaned over my back and hugged his hand and said he was ready to play sometime tomorrow," Furyk said.
He does not lack self-confidence.
He is on the list of the most famous athletes and has given both in the past and this week a lot to these teams.
I had no idea he was playing two games.
I imagined more, but it came out like this, so we decided to do it.
He wants to play like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Dr. Mickelson will improve Nick Faldo’s record and become the most successful Ryder Cup-winning athlete.
It may be that this marks the end of his Ryder Cup career, as well as the unrivalled heights of his personal records.
Ph. Mickelson owns 18 wins, 20 losses and seven equals, but Furyk claims that his presence has also brought intangible benefits to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, conscientious, he likes to laugh at people, and he’s a great guy to be with in the team room,” he said.
“I think the younger players this week also had a lot of fun hanging out with him, it was good to watch it.
“It’s a lot more than a game.”
European captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn knows that a great deal of weight can quickly pass
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a big overhang as the last Ryder Cup units races approach, can easily turn into a tough fight.
The Danish athlete made his debut in a 1997 match at Valderama, where the team led by Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but crossed the finish line only just leading 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2:131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“We keep reminding ourselves that we had a big overweight in Valderama; we had a big overweight in Brooklyn, where we lost, and also in Valderama, where we won, but only barely,” said T. Bjorn (pictured), who watched the victory of the 2018 show on the National 5:3 on Friday and the 10th of December.
Then the story will show me and all the team members that it’s not over yet.
We will need all our strength tomorrow.
Go ahead and do everything right.
As long as there are no points on the board, the game is not finished.
We have a goal – to try to win this prize – so we have to pursue it consistently.
I have always said that I rely on the 12 players who are on our side, but we know who is on the other side – the best players in the world.”
Satisfied with his players' appearances on a challenging pitch, Bjorn added: "I would not want to run behind my own eyes in any way.
Tomorrow will be a very different hairstyle.
Tomorrow, the most important thing will be an individual game - it's something else.
It’s great to play with a partner when things go well, but when you’re on the pitch alone, the limits of your ability to play golf are tested.
This idea needs to be installed by the players – tomorrow you will have to squeeze everything out of yourself.
Now he will have to break up with his partner, and he will have to squeeze everything out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk expects his players to perform better individually than as partners, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself experienced both sides of the surprises of the last day because Brooklyn was on the winning team until Europe performed the miracle of Medina and turned them into losers.
"I remember every damn word," he said when asked how 1999 captain Ben Crenshaw motivated his players to prepare for the final day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but aim for a quick start – as you have seen in Brussels and Medina.
When the acceleration occurs in one direction, the middle matches become very tense.
"We have accordingly formed our team and released the players in a way that we, you know... we're trying to create some magic tomorrow."
Thomas will have to face Rory McIlroy in a top-level match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jonas Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter leading the Europeans.
“I chose these guys in this order because I think they will be successful in the whole game,” Bjorn said of his choice of units.
The launch of a new German warship has been postponed.
Germany’s newest navy frigate was due to start work back in 2014 and replace Cold War-era warships, but local media say it won’t be seen until at least next year due to ever-deteriorating systems and skyrocketing prices.
According to a military spokesman quoted by Die Zeit newspaper, the release of Rheinland-Pfalz, the main new frigate ship of the Baden-Württemberg class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019.
The ship was due to join the navy in 2014, but the fate of this ambitious project was overshadowed by problems with the already delivered ship.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships, ordered by the navy back in 2007, will replace the aging Bremen-class frigate.
It is believed that they will be equipped with a powerful condition, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and certain secretive technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic traces.
Another important feature is longer maintenance intervals, which would allow the latest frigates to sail away from home ports for up to two years.
However, according to Die Zeit, due to the endless delays in state-of-the-art technology, warships, which are said to allow Germany to direct military power to overseas territories, will slow down before they start to operate.
The failed F125 frigate hit the headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship already delivered to the builder.
The reason for the return is little known, but the German press mentions a number of essential software and hardware defects that would have caused the ship to have been in no-one's military mission.
Weaknesses in the software are particularly important, as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships will be operated by about 120 crew members, which is half the size of the older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it turned out that this ship is much too heavy – this reduces its efficiency and limits the ability of the military fleet to implement various improvements in the future.
It is estimated that 7,000 tonnes of Rheinland-Pfalz are twice the weight of similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
The cost of the entire project – along with the malfunctioning equipment, including crew training – is also gradually becoming a problem.
It is said to have risen from the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion to a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
The latest frigate wrestling problems have become particularly significant following recent warnings that the German navy’s power is dwindling.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the navy "is really lacking in ships fit for use."
The official said that problems had arisen over a period of time because the old ships had already been demolished, but there was no way to replace them.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates could join the navy.
The National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
A new study, conducted at a Scottish Highland Manor, aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
The findings are expected to provide new insights into the behaviour of unique flying mammals and provide some guidance for future conservation activities.
Scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will observe bats, soprano bats, brown ears and waterfowl in the gardens of Vester Rosa Inverevo.
In certain areas of the territory, special recorders will be placed, allowing you to track the activity of bats throughout the season.
National Health Service staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile tests with handheld detectors.
The analysis of all audio recordings carried out by experts will determine the frequency of the signals emitted by bats and the activity of one or another type.
A map and report of the living areas will then be created, which will help to form a detailed picture of the behavior on the scale of the whole landscape.
National Trust for Scotland (NTS) conservation adviser Rob Dewar hopes the results will reveal which habitats are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to identify the benefits of residential site maintenance work, such as grassland development, as well as how best to care for forested areas so that they are suitable for bats and other related species.
Over the past century, bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined.
They are endangered by construction and real estate development works that affect quarries and destroy residential areas.
Windmills and lightning are also at risk, as are moss, some chemical agents used to process building materials, as well as hunting domestic cats.
The bats are not really blind.
However, catching prey during night hunting helps the ears more than the eyes.
Insect bats or obstacles in the flight path shall be precisely positioned by means of sophisticated echolocation.
The NTS, which is responsible for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, looks particularly responsibly at bats.
It employs ten trained experts who regularly carry out surveys, inspections of quarries and sometimes rescue operations.
The organisation even created the first and only bat reserve in Scotland at the Threeveh Manor in Damfries and Galove, home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
Manor keeper David Thompson says the grounds of the manor are ideal for them.
“We have a great place for bats in Threave Manor,” he said.
– We have old buildings, many mature trees and great areas to live in.
But we don't know much about bats, so working here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to thrive."
He stresses that it is crucial to check for bats before the start of the site maintenance work, as the accidental destruction of one barn can kill up to 400 females and young, which can lead to the destruction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected and are prohibited from killing, annoying or disturbing them, as well as from destroying their nests.
Scottish bat protection fund official Elisabeth Ferrell urged the public to contribute to the rescue of bats.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we don’t even know how many of the local species are doing.”
Ronaldo Rejects Rape Allegations: Lawyers Are Going to Trial German Magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the accusations of rape “false” and said that people, in his name, “aspire to be famous.”
His lawyers have prepared to bring the German news magazine "Der Spiegel", which has published the accusations, to court.
An attacker from Portugal and Juventus is accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he had then paid the alleged woman $375,000 to silence the incident.
Speaking to 142 million followers on a live Instagram video hours after the allegations were made, 33-year-old Ronaldo criticized the reports and called them “false.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
“What they say today is a lie,” the winner of the Ballon d’Or said five times while looking at the camera.
They want to be famous in my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous, to say my name – that’s part of my work.
I’m a happy person, everything is fine,” the athlete added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over allegations they called "an unacceptable publicity of suspicions about things going on in private space."
Attorney Christian Schertz said the athlete would seek compensation for "moral damage that amounted to the materiality of this violation - probably one of the most serious violations of a person's rights over the past few years."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 at Palms Casino and hotel suites in Las Vegas.
According to documents handed over to the Nevada Clark County Courthouse, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the athlete's room after meeting at the nightclub, where he allegedly raped her anal.
Mayorga says Ronaldo attacked the road after the alleged incident and told her he was a “99 percent good man” betrayed by the remaining “one percent” of his personality.
According to the documents, Ronaldo admitted that the couple had had sexual relations, but claimed that they had been contracted.
Mayorga also says she turned to the police and her injuries at the hospital were photographed, but later agreed to a non-judicial settlement because she was "afraid of retaliatory action" and worried she would be "publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to cancel the deal because she continues to feel traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was a staunch mover from Manchester United to Madrid's Real club, and this summer, signing a $100 million deal, joined Italian giant Juventus.
‘Brexit’: UK would regret losing car makers forever
Business Secretary Greg Clark said the UK would be “forever sorry” if it lost its status as the world’s leading automaker after Brexit.
He added that he was concerned about the statement by the BBC of the Toyota unit in the United Kingdom that if Britain left the EU without a deal, production would be temporarily suspended at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
“We need an agreement,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said that a border shutdown without a deal would result in the loss of jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
“In my opinion, if Britain suddenly leaves the European Union at the end of March, our factory will have to stop production,” said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota.
Other UK automakers, including Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover, also voiced concerns about a no-deal exit from the EU and its consequences for international trade.
For example, BMW says it will close its MINI plant after a month of Brexit.
According to automakers, the most worrying are the threats to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The Toyota production line works when needed, as custom-built parts are delivered every 37 minutes from both UK and EU suppliers.
If the UK leaves the EU without a contract on 29 March, there could be disruptions to the border; according to the industry, this could lead to delays in the delivery of the details or a lack of them.
Toyota said it could not store more than one day’s supply at the Derbyshire plant to halt production.
According to Clark, the future relationship with the EU foreseen by Theresa May's Chequers plan is "prepared precisely to avoid such border checks."
“We need a contract. We want to have the best contract that, as I say, would allow us not only to enjoy success today, but also to take advantage of this opportunity,” he told the BBC’s Today Radio 4 programme.
“Not only Toyota, but also data from other car manufacturers shows that it is essential to continue to have access to a highly successful supply chain system.”
Toyota could not say for how long production would be halted, but warned that in the long run, additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallar, who has worked at the Burnaston plant for 24 years and is responsible for the union meetings of Unite, said that his union members are increasingly concerned: "I say from experience that if these jobs are lost, they will never come back."
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed targets and a credible plan for future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed, White House says
"As the fight for a Supreme Court nominee continues, Donald Trump's crucial meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed for another week," the White House said in a statement.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, the latter investigating Russia’s interference in the election, Trump’s aides’ ties to Russia, and the president’s possible obstruction of justice.
The question of whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, thus threatening Mueller’s independence, has sparked rumours in Washington for months.
The New York Times reported this month that Rosenstein had discussed carrying a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein rejected this report.
However, flashing reports of his resignation, he went to the White House last Monday.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, who was at the time in the United Nations in New York, would take place on Thursday.
Short said he was reluctant to pardon Rosenstein, and the meeting was later postponed to disagree with a Senate Judiciary Committee meeting where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, testified.
On Friday, Trump told the FBI to investigate Kavanaugh's allegations within a week, deferring the vote in the Senate's plenary session.
Shorty's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "It's not a fixed date. It can happen this week, but taking into account all the events related to the Supreme Court, it can be postponed for another week.
But we'll see. I always like to report to the press."
Some journalists would not agree with this statement: Sanders has not held a single White House press conference since September 10.
Chairman Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the press conferences rarely take place not because of the dislike of TV journalists "seeking effects for viewers." True, he added: "I have to agree with the fact that they are seeking effects for viewers."
He then pointed out that Trump would communicate more often with the press directly.
"The president answers questions more often than any previous president," she said, without providing any evidence, adding: "We've reviewed this statistic."
Sanders said the press conferences would be held, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it's much better than talking to me.
We have often tried to do this, and you have seen that many times in the last few weeks. Press conferences will replace your direct communication with the President of the United States."
Short constantly responds to questions by leaving the White House, attending public meetings or press conferences with honorable guests.
One-person press conferences are rare.
The president’s free and sometimes bizarre appearance against journalists this week in New York probably explained why.
Scotland's Health Minister writes to EU staff about Brexit concerns
The Scottish Minister of Health wrote a letter to EU workers expressing the country's gratitude and desire to remain after Brexit.
Scotland’s Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of applications for permanent resident status for EU citizens working in the public service sector entrusted to it.
Freeman wrote in the letter: “In the summer, the UK-EU withdrawal negotiations have continued and are approaching the decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK government has begun to prepare more quickly for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know you are all very worried now.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how I value the contribution of all employees – no matter what their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and elsewhere bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare system and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery
The Vanderbilt Commodores team lost the race to a head injury to Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie in an emergency operation on Saturday at 31:27, Tennessee journalist Mike Organa said.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the trauma occurred just before the break.
“He came to the sideline and just dropped there,” Reed said.
Trainers and doctors at the Abercrombie sideline breathed oxygen, later lying on a stretcher and sent it out for further testing.
Tennessee State Officer Chris Harris of Nashville (Tennessee) WSMV said Abercrombie's surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center was completed.
Harris added that “there is no information yet about the type and extent of the trauma,” and Tennessee State is trying to determine when it occurred.
Abercrombie, who is officially spending the sporting season, has moved on from Illinois and is playing for Tennessee State for the first season.
Before leaving the game, on Saturday he rebounded five balls, and the total number of balls he rebounded during the season reached 18.
Foreign buyers buying UK real estate will have to pay a higher nominal fee
Under the new Tories plans, foreign buyers buying UK real estate will have to pay a higher nominal fee, and the additional money to be received will be used to help the homeless
This step will reduce the risk posed by a successful Corbyn campaign to attract young voters
The UK tax will be levied on non-taxable persons in the UK.
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers buying UK real estate are going to be taxed at a higher rate of nominal tax, and the extra money received to help the homeless.
By promising to provide more affordable housing and targeting high-income people, this step is expected to reduce the risk posed by Jeremy Corbyn's successful campaign to attract young voters.
An increased nominal tax will be levied on non-taxable persons and businesses in the UK, and the additional money will be allocated to the Government’s anti-money laundering campaign.
An additional fee – paid next to the current nominal tax, including higher rates for second home buyers or renters two years ago – can reach as much as three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects this step to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the newly built real estate in London is bought by non-UK residents, which raises prices and makes it harder for first-time home buyers to do so.
Many foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the country, making many of the country’s wealthy and especially metropolitan areas ghost towns.
The new strategy was unveiled just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a significant tax cut to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of quickly buying land but not using it, supporting high real estate prices, and called on May to address the shame of Britain’s housing supply by abandoning buy-in home quotas.
Corbyn has announced several eye-catching proposed housing reforms, including rent control and a no-fault ban on unloading.
In addition, he wants to build more power to give new houses to municipal councils.
“Last year, I said that as Prime Minister, I will try to bring back the British dream that every new generation should have a better life.
This means that we need to fix our troubled housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and create life here.
However, it is wrong that non-residents and companies established abroad can buy a home as easily as hard-working British citizens.
For many people, the dream of housing has become almost unrealistic, and the threat of homelessness humiliation is still too real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead the Scottish national team"
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, says his ultimate goal is to one day become Scotland’s national team leader.
A 42-year-old Scotsman enjoys the challenge of reviving the North-East club, currently in third place in the first league and three points behind the first-placed club.
Having led St Mirren back to the Scottish Championships last season, he moved to the Stadium of Light this summer.
“As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
I got into the B squad and it was over," Ross told the BBC's Scotland's Sportssound.
“But when I was a kid, I grew up at Hamden Stadium with my dad watching a lot of Scottish national team matches, and that always drew me back.
“This is only going to happen if I manage the club successfully.”
Rosso Sunderland was led by Dickas Advocatas, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neillas, Roy Keane, Gus Poyetas and Paulo Di Canio.
Having previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town's bids, the former Alloa Athletic manager says he didn't feel anxious about starting to work after such well-known leaders at such a large club.
“Now my success will be judged by the answer to the question ‘Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’
According to the structure and conditions, this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get him out of there, but maybe only after I've brought the club back into the league, I think I've worked here successfully."
Rosso's leadership career lasted only three years, before which he worked as a manager's assistant at Dumbarton Club and replaced Hearts coaches for 15 months.
He later helped recover the Alloa, who had fallen into the third division, and turned the St Mirren club, who was threatened with falling, into the championship winners the following season.
Ross says he is now more satisfied than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“This change was probably radical,” <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> recalls the leadership of Alloa.
“I honestly believed that to lead is better for me than to play.
It sounds strange, because I succeeded, I earned a lot and I was happy with the successes.
But playing can be difficult.
You have to overcome a lot of problems every week.
And now it’s not easy – work stress and tension, but I feel that leadership is exactly what I need.
I always wanted to lead, and now I do. As an adult, I always felt like I was in my own right, but leadership brings the greatest satisfaction."

The summer heatwave has boosted the incomes of Britain’s poor pubs, but has further aggravated the burden on restaurant chains.
The figures revealed that in July, sales of pubs and bars increased by 2.7 percent, but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, from CGA, a business consulting firm that compiled the data, said: “The never-ending solar eclipse and longer than expected, England’s participation in the World Cup meant that in July, the same trends continued as in June, when allotment revenues increased by a further 2.8 percent.
In June, restaurant sales fell by 1.8 percent, and in July, the situation became even worse.
The main revenues from the sale of soft drinks and bars were undoubtedly the best, and the trade in them grew stronger than it did in restaurants.
Although not as strong as restaurant companies, beer, which generates the main income from food trade, has also been affected by the sunburn.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In well-managed breweries and bars, sales of beverages rose this month by 6.6 percent, while food sales fell by 3 percent."
Paul Newman, from RSM’s analysis of the leisure and fitness sector, said: “These results continue the trend seen since the end of April.
With regard to catering establishments, the main factors remain the impact of the weather and the major social and sporting events.
So it’s no wonder that restaurant groups continue to be depleted. True, a drop of 4.8 percent in sales over the course of a year will be particularly painful, as it will contribute to the unwavering cost pressure.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for most food-trading companies. Time will show whether the milder temperature felt in August will give such a necessary respite."
Total sales growth in beers and restaurants, including newly opened locations, was 2.7 percent in July and reflected a slowdown in the development of brand-owned networks.

One in five children has social media accounts hidden from their parents.
The study found that one in five children — some as young as 11 — have social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed that the number of fake Insta pages is increasing
The news has heightened fears that sexual content is being published
Twenty percent of students said they had to show their parents a master account.
One in five children — some as young as 11 — create secret social media accounts and hide them from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found that fake Insta pages were growing rapidly, a link to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has heightened fears that sexual content is being published
Twenty percent of students said they use a censored primary account to show parents, but they also have secret accounts.
One mother, who accidentally found a secret website for her 13-year-old daughter, found out that the teen was insistently suggesting, “Bring me out.”
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent School Directors Conference (MDK) found that 40 percent of 11<0xE2><0x8E><0xAF>18-year-old students had two accounts, and half of those admitted to hiding accounts.
Mike Buchanan, MDK’s chief executive, said: “The fact that so many teenagers give in to the temptation to create virtual spaces where they can’t be found by parents and teachers is worrying.”
Eilidha Doyle will be the voice of athletes in the Scottish Sports Council
Eilidha Doyle was elected as a consultant at the annual meeting of the governing body of the Scottish Sports Council.
Doyle is the most award-winning Scottish athlete and chairwoman. Ian Beattie described this step as a great opportunity for sports leaders to take advantage of the diverse international experience she has gained over the past decade.
“Eilidha has earned a lot of respect throughout the Scottish, UK and global sports community and we have no doubt that its inclusion in the Scottish Sports Council will bring a lot of benefits,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I really want to serve as an athlete’s voice and I hope to really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland.”
The 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlantic Games and a total of four Olympic gold medal winners, now appearing as a permanent BBC expert, were unable to walk following a short-term ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
I had to work until exhaustion, but I completely recovered, I learned to walk again and today I do mobility exercises!
Thank you for your messages of encouragement!”
Breastfeeding advertising, in which mothers are compared to cows, received different evaluations online
The breastfeeding company has received differing opinions about its advertising, in which nursing mothers are compared to dairy cows.
To mark the launch of the product, described as the world's first silent portable breast lift, the consumer technology company Elvie has released an advertisement inspired by an ironic music video. It aims to demonstrate the freedom that nursing mothers give to nursing mothers.
In this full carnival, four real mothers dance to the sound of the tape, which says, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but I can't see any tails" and "If you haven't noticed, here's not the butterfly, here's my breasts."
The appendix continues: "Take it out, take it out, feed it to the babies, take it out, take it out, milk my beauties."
However, an advertisement posted on the company’s Facebook page sparked an online dispute.
Viewed 77,000 times and received a few hundred comments, the video reacted differently. Many said that it looks at the horrors of the dairy industry through the fingers.
“Advertising cows for this product is a very poor solution.
Like us, they have to conceive and give birth in order to produce milk, only their newborns are taken away after a few days," she wrote.

Another commented: “It is understood that it traumatizes both the mother and the newborn.
But why not take advantage of them for advertising a breast pump for mothers whose babies they don’t take away?”
Someone else added: “Advertising is a complete misunderstanding.”
Another commentator defended the ad – one woman admitted that the song appeared to her “very fun”.
“I think the idea is brilliant.
I would buy it if I still had food.
When I stopped drinking milk, I felt like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I accepted it as what it is.
This product is brilliant," <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> wrote one.
Another commented: “This fun commercial is for moms who are milking (often at work or toilets) and feel like cows.
Its purpose is not to intoxicate or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveals that all of them were dancing with unobtrusive breastplates fitted in their bras.
The idea of the campaign is based on the insight that many breastfeeding women say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie milkshake does not release any sound, has no wires or tubes, and fits in a feeding bra unnoticed – so women can move around freely, hold babies or even leave the house while pulling the milk.
Mother’s partner and Creative Director, Ana Balarin, commented: “Elvie’s milkshake is a revolutionary product that deserves to be launched boldly and provocatively.
When comparing feeding women with dairy cows, we wanted to pay attention to the discontinuation of milk and all the challenges it poses, while at the same time having fun and showing as much as possible the incredible sense of freedom that the new milkshake will provide.
It was not for the first time that Elvie’s toothpaste hit the headlines.
During London fashion week, designer Marta Jakubowski’s mother of two demonstrated on the podium using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to tent camp near Texas border
The number of people crossing the border has not changed substantially in a month, but the number of children detained has increased significantly, partly because of the Trump administration’s strict rhetoric and policies that have made it harder for them to stay with their guardians.
Traditionally, the majority of carers themselves were undocumented immigrants and feared that applying for childcare risked the possibility of staying in the country.
After the federal government announced in June that potential guardians and other adult members of their families would have to provide fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities, the risk rose further.
Last week, Immigration and Customs Enforcement Chief Matthew Albence testified to Congress that the institution had detained several dozen people who applied for the custody of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had not been tried before.
“Nearly 80 percent of these people – guardians or their family members – live illegally in the country, and most of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we will continue to persecute these individuals,” Albence said.
According to the shelter workers, in order to consider children's cases faster, officials introduced new rules. Under them, some children must appear in court within a month of detention, and not within 60 days, as was usual before.
Many will try to defend the application for legal status before a judge on immigration issues, not by coming in in person, but by using a video conference call.
Those who are not eligible for aid will be deported quickly.
According to reports received from shelter workers and in recent months from the system, the longer children remain detained, the more likely they are to become uneasy or depressed, which can trigger violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
Defenders say this is even more of a concern in large institutions such as Tornillo's Shelter: the size of them increases the likelihood of not noticing signs that the child is struggling.
They added that moving children to a tent town without enough time to prepare them emotionally or say goodbye to friends can deepen the trauma many have already experienced.
Syria has ordered the US, French and Turkish occupying forces to withdraw immediately.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also invited Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war has been going on in the country for eight years.
Moualem, who is also serving as Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces in the land of Syria under the pretext of counter-terrorism are illegal and will be treated accordingly.
“They must leave immediately and without any conditions,” he told the assembly.
Moualem claimed that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have had to leave their homes, the war on terror is almost over.
He said that Damascus will not stop fighting this holy battle until we destroy both terrorist groups and any illegal aliens in all areas of Syria.
There are about 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria, mostly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in a war-torn country.
Speaking about the refugee problem, Moualem said the conditions for their return were good, while accusing some Western countries of spreading unfounded fears that discouraged refugees from returning.
“We appealed to the international community and humanitarian organizations to help them return,” he said.
“They politicize what should be a purely humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will receive reconstruction aid only after Assad and the opposition reach a political agreement and end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey at the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib to establish a buffer zone has created the conditions for faster progress in political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has helped avert a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces aimed at the province, home to three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement provided for clear deadlines, and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra front, which would be destroyed.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to prepare a draft Syrian post-war constitution and prepare the ground for elections soon.
Moualem set out the conditions under which the Syrian government would participate in the committee – the group’s work should be limited to a revision of the articles of the current constitution, and warned not to interfere.
Why would Trump be elected for a second term?
According to this logic, in 2020, Trump would be elected unless, as many liberal spectators are likely to expect, his presidency would be ended by an accusation and scandal in the past.
It would be the most dramatic end to the presidency ever!
So far, no signs of fatigue have been seen.
Since the best time of broadcasting in 2014, ratings on CNN TV have more than doubled to 1.05 million, and MSNBC has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million best-performing viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show ranks first in cable television ratings with as many as 3.5 million viewers on mainstream news nights.
“It’s the fire that draws people because we don’t understand something,” says Neal Baer, who produces ABC’s Descendant about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack on the House of Congress.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of "Only Fun Parts and a Few Unpleasant Truths About How to Secretly Enter the Hollywood Boys' Club," has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
"He said, 'He makes me laugh,'" Scovell said.
Chaos is worth having fun with.
Of course, unlike other TV shows, the stories coming out of Washington can determine Roe’s case against Wade’s future, the opportunity to unite immigrant families, and the state of the global economy.
Failing to watch is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it’s more than necessary to be an informed citizen when you realize that a group of experts have been watching Donald Trump for six hours discussing how Bob Woodward uses sensitive data in his book Fear, and Paul Manafort is showing a $15,000-cost ostrich-skin jacket with a “story of the Post.”
At least I’ll never see Super Mario again.
"His actions are reminiscent of a reality show because every night he throws something away," <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> said of the changing characters of the Trump show and the daily twists of the story (a run into conflict with N.F.L. or a tribute to Kim Jong-un) by Breelhouse Entertainment's general manager and Pawn.
You can't miss a single series, otherwise you'll be behind.
When I reached out to Fleiss this week, outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, it was 27 degrees of heat and bright sun, but he was drowning inside and, recording CNN, was watching MSNBC.
He couldn’t shake it off, certainly not when Brett Kavanaugh had to stand before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging on his head.
“I remember when we were doing those crazy shows, people were like, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss said.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right.”

In the tense mid-term elections to the House of Representatives, money from around the world is pouring into the fight
No wonder the reorganization of congressional districts, which ended in an attempt by two members of the House of Representatives to win the same post, overflowed Pennsylvania’s 17th district with money.
A recently revamped suburb of Pittsberg County involved Democratic House Speaker Conor Lamb in the fight – last spring he won his seat in a special election in another county.
Lambs is competing with another member of the House of Representatives, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania. Much of it overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had been falsified in violation of the constitution for the benefit of the Republicans.
During the election campaign in the new 17th district, the financial institutions of the main parties – the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DKKK) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRKK) – got together on the finances of the campaign.
Lambs became famous in Pennsylvania when a small majority of votes in the 18th congressional district won a widely-watched special election in March.
For more than a decade, Republicans have taken the place, and President Donald Trump has won 20 points in the county.
Politicians have given the Democrats some advantage.
U.S. Considers El Salvador Punishment for Supporting China, But After Reassurance
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, but have largely failed to receive Washington’s negative response.
In June 2017, Trump attended a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and had a hotel in the country until the partners ousted the Trump Organization leadership.
“Due to recent decisions that have not been recognized, officials from the Taiwanese State Department have decided to remove the heads of American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama,” department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions are under consideration only for El Salvador, which in 2017 received approximately $140 million in American aid, as well as for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including reductions in financial aid and visa restrictions for specific individuals, would have been painful for a country in Central America with a high level of unemployment and murder.
During the internal meetings, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity. It was supposed to take place after a similar meeting last year, which was seen as an important step forward in preventing migrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, top administration officials made clear they wanted the conference to take place, effectively ending any deliberations on sanctions against El Salvador.
“To demonstrate the importance of the administration to this gathering, Vice President Mike Pence is now included in the list of speakers scheduled for mid-October at the conference,” the diplomats said.
The three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any warnings or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were told by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations only if their anonymity would be preserved.
Their stories are confirmed by an analyst close to the administration, who also spoke if his anonymity will be preserved.
Learn the Histories
It is inevitable that special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice will continue to be awaited – his very strong evidence is now available in the public archives.
In addition, Mueller's investigation raises the question of whether Trump's campaign was conducted in secret in cooperation with Russia, which has been hurting our elections.
If Congress were to move into other hands, Trump would have to take responsibility in this institution at the same time as he is preparing to stand again before the electorate, and perhaps finally before the executive commission.
There is a lot of “if” here, and I am not saying that the end of Trump is inevitable – just like his counterparts in Europe.
We will all have to choose on both sides of the Atlantic, and these choices will determine whether the fight will continue for a long time.
In 1938, German officials were ready to overthrow Hitler – all that was needed was for the West to resist him and support the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We took a break and missed the opportunity to prevent slaughterhouses that lasted for several years.
History revolves around such essential turning points – then the unstoppable march of democracy is accelerated or halted.
Now the Americans have come to a number of such essential turning points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man on whom Mueller’s investigation depends?
Rosenstein's troubles began when the newspaper reported that last year the official had offered to secretly register the president and had been discussing his unfitness to take office.
Rosenstein says the Times story is inaccurate.
“How will we react if the new investigation by the FBI into Bretto Kavanaugh turns out to be incomplete or incorrect, or if, despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony, this candidate is appointed to the Supreme Court?
And, finally, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will make Short assume responsibility?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy is in danger of a long winter.
But because of the lessons I learned in Prague, I believe we will keep them.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew and was taken to Osvencim by the same Nazi regime that once lived in the house where I lived as an ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America and 60 years later sent me out to light a shaba candle on a table with a swastika.
When I have such a legacy, how can I look at our future unoptimistically?”

Graham Dorrans from the Rangers clash with Rapid Vienna is optimistic
On Thursday, the Rangers will accept Rapid Vienna knowing that if they win against Austro-Hungarians after their impressive competition in Spain earlier this month, they could be in a strong position to leave Group G.
As a result of a road injury midfielder Graham Dorrans was only able to appear for the first time this season in a 2:2 finish with Villarreal, but he hopes the Rangers club can use this result as a springboard towards more important goals.
“This was a good result for us because Villarreal is a great team,” the 31-year-old said.
“We started with the belief that we would achieve something, and we finished with that.
Maybe in the end we could have been more relevant, but overall the competition was not bad.
They probably played better on the first pitch, and we took a bite in the second and showed us who we are a better team.
Thursday will be another important evening of the European League.
I hope that we will be able to get three points. The game will be difficult, because in the last races their result was excellent. But I have no doubt that with the support of the spectators we can get ahead and achieve a good result.
“Last year was really hard – both what happened with my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but now there is a good mood.
The team is good and the guys are really happy; the training is great.
I hope that now we will be able to move forward, forget about last season and play successfully."
Because of this fear of pension savings, a woman suffers from insomnia
While the survey participants had a clear idea of what kind of care they would like to receive, few talked about it with family members.
About half of the respondents to the Nationwide survey said they talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with children.
“People want to be taken care of by a family member, but they’re not trying to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationalwide Life Insurance.
That's where we need to start.
Talk to your spouse and children. If you do not give your wishes in advance, the family will not be ready to take care of you.
Discuss with your counselor and family where and what care you would like to receive, as these factors may be important in predicting costs.
Call a financial advisor. The advisor can also help you figure out a way to pay for these expenses.
You can choose to cover these costs with a traditional long-term care insurance certificate, a mixed-value money<0xE2><0x8E><0xAF>life insurance certificate, or by insuring your assets as long as you have the money.
Elaborate legal documents. Prevent legal disputes with documents that allow you to protect yourself.
Designate a trusted person who will take care of your medical care and ensure that professionals will respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also, think about the authority to take care of your finances.
You should choose a reliable person who will make financial decisions for you and make sure that the bills are paid if you become insolvent.
Don’t forget the details. Imagine that your elderly father or mother needs urgent medical attention and is transported to or from the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
To be prepared, write down these details in a plan.
“It’s not just the financial issues that matter. Who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“Which medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Plan it, too.”
Ilfrakume man shot several times with pneumatic gun
After spending the evening in the city, the man who came home was shot several times with a pneumatic gun.
The 40-year-old victim was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm by Ilfracombe in the Oxford Grey area of Devon.
At about 2:30 a.m. in the summer in England, police described the shooting as an accidental act.
The victim was not seen.
The injuries do not threaten his life, and the police are asking for the help of witnesses.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
“At least 384 people were killed when a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday,” officials said, adding that the death toll is expected to rise further.
As a result of the destruction of communications, officials were unable to obtain any data from the Dongala Regency, a site north of Palu that is close to the 7.5-point earthquake epicentre.
As a result of the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongala on Sulawesi Island.
In 2017, Palu, with a population of about 379,800, is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, established at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island.
When the quake hit and tsunami hit, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regency located along the more than 300 km (180 miles) coastline in the north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
About 299,200 people lived in the Regency – outside the province in a smaller administrative region – in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the main economic pillars of the central province of Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated on the coast of Morovalia on the other side of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia’s disaster mitigation agency, Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past century.
In 1938, the Dongala tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, a tsunami struck western Dongala, killing nine people.
Earthquakes are constantly raging over Indonesia’s seismicly active Pacific Ring of Fire.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years.
On December 26, 2004, a strong quake on the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast - more than half of them in Aceh.
In late March and early April 2005, several strong quakes rocked the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on the nearby island of Nias.
In 2006, a magnitude 6.8 quake rocked the southernmost inhabited island of Indonesia, Java, causing a tsunami that struck the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
In 2009, a magnitude 7.6 quake shook the area near the western capital of Sumatra province, Tire.
More than 1,100 people died.
A 7.5-point quake in 2010 shook one of the islands near Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters of waves that wiped out dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
In 2016, due to a weak earthquake in Aceh, the Pydia Jaya regency was destroyed and panicked as people remembered how everything was devastated after the terrible 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people were killed.
In 2018, strong quakes rocked the heavily visited island of Lombok by Indonesian tourists and killed more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
Thousands of buildings were destroyed by the earthquake and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded on the coast.
Sarah Palin's son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
A police report released on Saturday said Palin, 29, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of reporting of domestic violence, and opposition to detention.
According to a police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report suspected crimes, he took her phone away.
As reported by KTUU, Palin was returned to Mat-Su pre-trial detention and released for a $500 bail.
"On Saturday, he appeared in court, where, when acquitted, he claimed to be completely innocent," the network said.
Palin is charged with three Class A offences, which means he can be jailed for up to one year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B offence, a prison sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the suspected attack.
The case is currently being heard by the Alaska Veterans Court.
He was charged in January 2016 with assaulting his home, obstructing the reporting of a crime of domestic violence and holding a gun while he was intoxicated.
His girlfriend said he punched her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans when she linked her son’s brutal behavior to a posttraumatic stress disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in a tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not working. It is expected that the number of deaths will increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near central Sulawesi, located northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On social media, videos are shared, in which you can see the moment of the tsunami impact.
The tsunami hit the coast when hundreds of people gathered for a beach holiday in Palu.
U.S. Attorneys Seek Rare Death Penalty for Suspect of New York Terrorist Attack
In New York, federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, a suspected terrorist attack in the city of New York that killed eight people. This is a rare punishment that has not been carried out in this state for federal crimes since 1953.
It is suspected that on October 31, 30-year-old Saipov rented a truck from the Home Depot and carried out an attack on bicycles along the western highway in Lower Manhattan – while driving along the trail, he put pedestrians and cyclists to sleep.
According to a report in the southern New York City district about his intention to seek the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipova intentionally killed eight victims and caused serious bodily injuries.
According to the court document, both of these defendants can be sentenced to death.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury of defendants issued a 22-point indictment to Saipov, which included eight counts of murder in connection with property rape (usually by federal prosecutors in motorized crime cases), and a count of indictment against Saipov.
Prosecutors say the attack was very well-planned and premeditated, and the way Saipova carried it out called it ugly, cruel, and immoral.
"Sayful Habibullaevich Saipov's actions have injured, injured and lost loved ones of the following families: Diego Enrique Angelinio, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake's, Ariel Erliy, Hernano Ferruchio's, Hernano Ferruchio's Dam and Hernano Diego Menzomo.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last case that required the death penalty was heard in the South District of New York a decade ago.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last death penalty was carried out in 1953 in a New York federal case against spouses Julius and Ethela Rosenberg, when they were convicted two years ago of conspiring to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, who came from Uzbekistan, did not regret his actions either immediately after the attack or several months later.
According to police, he told investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov revealed to officials that he was inspired to carry out the attack by videos of the Islamic State (ISIS) that he watched on his phone.
Police said he also asked the hospital palace to hang the flag of the Islamic State.
He did not plead guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of Saipov's federal state-funded defenders, said they were obviously disappointed by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that a decision to seek the death penalty rather than plead guilty and go to prison without the possibility of being released will only prolong the trauma of these events for all concerned," Patton said.
Saipovo’s defense team has previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tories MP says Brexit negotiations must be blamed on NIGELAS FARAGE<0xCA><0xBC>AS
Today, during a protest at a Tories conference, Niguel Farage promised to mobilize the nation’s army.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should feel the heat of Eurosceptics, and one of Theresa May’s MPs suggested that he lead negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, a member of the Conservative House of Commons, told protesters in Birmingham that the UK would have stepped down if Farage had been the Brexit secretary.
But the difficulties that May faces in trying to unite the divided ranks of supporters have been revealed by the EU’s pro-remaining Tories, who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister finds it difficult to implement the compromise plan agreed in her Chequers when it is attacked by Brexit supporters, opponents and the EU.
The Allies insisted that it try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the hostile reaction and force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose its package or chaos.
Bone during the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull said he wanted to disrupt Chequers' plan.
He argued that Farage should have been an equal partner and should have been given the responsibility to negotiate with Brussels.
“If he had led, we would have already left the EU,” he said.
He added: “I will fight for Brexit, but we have to reject the Chequers plan.”
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to obey others.
We want to make our own laws.”
Bone denied the suggestion that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The belief that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely false.”
Brexit advocate Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the demonstrations and told reporters: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The chess plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular among our party members and activists who go to the streets and, most importantly, vote for us.
Give up the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a critical statement, May added: “Premiers keep their posts when they keep their promises.”
Farage said rallies politicians must be forced to feel the heat if they issue a 2016 referendum decision.
“Now it’s a matter of our trust, the people and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, so we’re here today to tell them we’re not going to let them get away with it.”
Addressing an enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which almost betrayed Brexit, feel the heat.
We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country that has brought us the victory of Brexit, and we will not stop until we become independent, self-governing and proud in the United Kingdom."
And opponents of Brexit marched through the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
After the group was formed this weekend, a group of activists mojave with posters “Tories against Brexit”.
Labour leader Lord Adonis denounced the Conservatives for the security problems they experienced over the party's app after the conference began.
“These are the people who say they can install the IT systems and all the technology needed for Canada plus plus, for frictionless borders and free trade without borders with Ireland,” he said.
“This is a complete farce.
“There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren is planning to seriously consider participating in the presidential election
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said that after the November election, she will seriously consider whether to participate in the presidential election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a meeting with the public on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, who consistently criticizes President Donald Trump, is in a November re-election meeting with GOP state representative Geoff Diehl, one of the leaders of Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It was predicted that she might meet with Trump in 2020.
Since Trump became president, Saturday afternoon’s event in Holloway has been her 36th meeting with voters using the format of a public meeting with the public.
One of the participants asked if she planned to participate in the presidential election.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington and repair the collapsed government, and women should lead the way.
Suspect arrested in LSU Simso shooting case
Louisiana’s Baton Rouge police said on Saturday they had arrested the suspect after shooting LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
At a press conference at 11:00 a.m., Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson.
Police released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man.
The 20-year-old Sims was kidnapped and died near the South University campus early Friday.
According to 247sports, police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday that Wayde Sims had been shot in the head and died of injuries.
Wayde stood up to defend his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the crime scene, holding a gun and shooting at Wayde's Sims.
Simpson, who was detained, was not resisted and was detained at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
The 198 cm high student of the previous course, Sims, grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games last season, 10 of which started at the start of the fifth, spent an average of 17.4 minutes on the pitch, gained 5.6 points and rebounded after 2.9 balls.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world champion's title when team instructs him to give victory to Sebastian Vettel
When Valtteri Bott beat Lewis Hamilton in the qualifying race on Saturday, it was immediately clear that the Mercedes team's instructions in the race would be extremely important.
Starting from the first place, Bott started well and, defending his position in the first two corners, barely left Hamilton in trouble, prompting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to turn into a two-part garage, left Hamilton and returned to the race in the group's tail, so it was fateful.
Mercedes turned into a two-seater garage under the wheel and returned to the track behind Vettel, but Hamilton, after barely finishing the contact, sprang forward after a Ferrari driver after a double maneuver to keep his position in the third corner of the lap.
Max Verstappen, who is celebrating his 21st birthday, started from the end of the row, but at the end of the first round he was already on the seventh.
He was the fastest for most of the race as he drove without changing his tyres to be as fast as possible in the finish, beat Kimi Raikkonen and finished fourth.
Finally, at 44, he turned to a two-car garage, but failed to increase the pace in the remaining eight rounds and Raikkonen crossed the finish line in the fourth.
“It was a tough day for Walter because he had a great weekend, and when I was asked to miss him, he acted like a real gentleman.
The team did a great job and won the first two places,” Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Saturday denounced Senator Dianne Feinstein for her persistent denial of Christine Blasey Ford’s leaked letter, in which Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh is accused of sexual assault.
Speaking in West Virginia, the president did not directly name the testimony given by Ford to the Senate Legal Committee, but said what is happening in the Senate has shown people to be naughty, naughty, and wrong.
“What could have happened and is actually happening in the last days of the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people being angry, unkind, impure and wrong,” he said.
“When you see official statements and leaks and then you say, ‘Hey, I didn’t do that.
I didn't do that."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you lose weight?
Do you remember her answer to the question, did the document leak? “Oh, oh, oh, what?
No, I'm not.
I didn't run."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we leak... no, we didn’t,” he added, imagining the senator.
In July, Feinstein received a letter detailing Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh, which had been dropped earlier in September, but Feinstein denied the letter had been leaked from her office.
According to The Hill, Feinstein told the committee: “I have not concealed Dr. Ford’s accusations and I have not leaked his story.”
“She asked to keep it a secret, and I did as she asked.”
However, it seems that the president did not agree with her rejection, and he said during a meeting with people on Saturday night: "You know, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't lose it, but it was the worst language I've ever seen in my body."
Further defending a Supreme Court nominee who was accused of unlawful sexual conduct by three women, the president said the Democrats used the accusations to their advantage.
“They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
You see indecency, indecency; they don’t care what they hurt or what they have to go through to gain power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5:3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer wins two goals in match against Dandi club Giants
The Dundee Stars picked up on Friday's loss to the Giants in Belfast's elite league and won Saturday's rebound match against Dandi with a 5:3 score.
The Giants made their way to the front when Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier scored two goals.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized the score before Dwyer brought the Giants forward again.
Francois Bouchard of the Dandi team equalized the result, but later two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
Adam Keefe's men suffered a third defeat this season in the Elite League, having previously captivated and beat Dandi Club 2-1 on Friday night in Belfast.
It was the fourth team meeting this season, three previous games won by the Giants.
Dwyer scored his first goal in the fourth minute (3.35) after Kendall McFaull's transfer, and four more minutes later, Beauvillier doubled his lead after David Rutherford's transfer.
In a difficult start, Sullivan brought the hosts back into the game with a 13:10 win, and after Matt Marquardt's transfer, Cownie equalised the score by 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took their first lead break, and at the end of the first innings, they won their second night's lead.
With a quantitative preponderance, the owners of the square regrouped and Bouchard again equalized the result 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen make it to the front of Dandi's team for the first time at the end of the second set, and cemented their victory by winning the team's fifth goal in the middle of the last set.
The Giants, who have already lost four of their last five games, will meet Milton Keynes' team at home on Friday.
Flight attendant killed to help hundreds of plane passengers escape the quake.
The Indonesian air traffic controller was declared a hero when he died helping a plane with several hundred passengers safely get into the air.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are believed to be missing after Friday’s earthquake on Sulawesi Island triggered a tsunami.
The site continued to be hit by strong repeated underground strikes and many people trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
While colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the highly-fluctuating management tower of Palu city’s Mutiara Sis Al-Jufri airport.
He stayed at his place of work to help a Batik Air plane, which was already on the runway at the time, safely take off on a 6321 flight.
Then, thinking that the flight control tower was collapsing, he jumped out of it.
He later died in the hospital.
According to Australian ABC News, Indonesian air navigation spokesman Yohannes Sirait said his decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
We flew him by helicopter from Kalimantan, Balikpapan, to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning, not yet reaching Palu for the helicopter.
“We are deeply saddened by this news,” he added.
The government fears the death toll could rise to thousands as the country’s disaster mitigation agency reports that the cities of Dangala, Sigi and Boutong are hard to reach.
"It is expected that the number of victims will increase further, because many of the victims are still under the rubble and we cannot reach them," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesman.
Up to six-meter-high waves destroyed the city of Palu, and a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supplies of supplies.
The 35-year-old's mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: "High-speed cars bring in the victims every minute.
There is a lack of clean water.
Self-service shops are being robbed everywhere.”
The head of the Indonesian International Red Cross, Janis Gelfand, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we do not know what we will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but the situation can get worse."
Indonesian President Jok Widoda arrived in Palu on Sunday and appealed to the country’s military: “I ask all of you to work day and night to carry out all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was rocked by the Lombok earthquake, which killed more than 550 people.
Plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says one person is missing after plane crashes into lagoon
The flight, which ended in a plane crash in Micronesia’s Pacific Lagoon, airlines now say one person is missing, though they have previously claimed all 47 passengers and crew were rescued from a sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that it had no knowledge of one passenger's husband on Saturday afternoon.
The airlines said they were working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
Airlines did not immediately respond to requests for more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuko Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said the six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
It remains unclear what caused the accident and what the exact sequence of events was.
Air Lines and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the landing path.
Some eyewitnesses believe that the plane failed to land on the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane crashed from a very low altitude.
“It was very good,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others had managed to glide down to emergency exits in a sinking plane that was flooded to his waist.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and screaming, and he himself suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said its sailors who repaired the dock nearby also helped rescue people who were inflated by a boat before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in plane crashes registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none of them belonged to Air Niugini.
The analyst laid out the sequence of events of the night when the woman was burned alive
The state prosecutor's office said the facts were available in a retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst with the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to bring together the movement of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and nineteen-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chamber on the night of her death, which contradicts previous statements.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to interrogate Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford stated his position and testified that he was not in his city that day.
When asked by prosecutors whether Tell was telling the truth, claiming that he was in a Sanford truck that night, Sanford replied that he was “lieing because his truck was in Nashville.”
Another disagreement was that Tell claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when Chambers died.
Mobile phone records show that they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and addressee information from his phone.
“He wiped her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is expected to begin teaching its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge stated to me that the case would be forwarded to the jurors later that same day.
"The High Breed": what is a conscious hip-hop?
The Hippopotamus trio wants to change the negative attitude to this genre by spreading its music positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that hip-hop has moved away from the roots of political messages and draws attention to social issues.
They want to return to the origins of hip-hop and popularize conscious hip-hop again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently resurfaced in the UK in the works of artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York babysitter sued a couple after being fired from work over 'racist' message
A New York-based nanny has sued a couple for dismissal from work for discrimination after receiving a message from a mother who complained she was "another black".
The couple denies being racist and called the lawsuit “rape.”
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, was shocked to learn that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived on her first working day in 2016.
“No, there’s only one black man,” Mr. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to his husband.
However, she was not sent to her husband twice, but to Mr. Maurice.
According to the New York Post, the reckless Plasco-Flaxman felt uncomfortable and fired Maurice, claiming that the former nanny, who was an African-American, had done her job poorly and instead expected to be a Filipino.
Maurice was paid for one working day and she was sent home by Uber.
Maurice has now sued the couple for compensation for the dismissal and seeks to gain as much as $350 a day for a half-year of living and working at a client’s home, to which she was initially hired even without a contract.
"I want to show them that such things cannot be done," she told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know this is discrimination."
The couple objected to the accusations of racism by denying it and said that dismissing Maurice from work was wise because they feared that they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She is not a racist.
We're not racists," Plasca's husband told the Post.
“Would you trust your children to someone you were ungrateful to, even though it was a mistake?
Your newborn?
They didn't."
Plasc, who described the lawsuit as “rape,” said his wife had given birth to a baby just two months ago and was “in a very difficult situation.”
Are you going to judge for it?
This is not a very good behavior,” added the investment banking specialist.
While the case was pending, the media rushed to condemn the couple on social media, criticizing their behavior and logic.
New Letter Reveals Paddington Publishers Fear Readers Won't Understand Talking Bear
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to feel someone else reading the book for the first time before it was released.
Now it’s very interesting to know what we know about Paddington’s tremendous success.”
Saying that her father, who worked for the BBC operator before discovering the inspiration to write a book for children about a plush bear, would not be too upset if his work had been rejected, added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was the year after his father's death.
Speaking about Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of the family", she added that the father was quietly proud of his success.
“He was a pretty calm man and didn’t like to brag,” she said.
“Because Paddington was so similar to him, he felt like he had a child who had achieved something: you’re proud of him, even though it’s not really your job.
I think he also appreciated Paddington's success story.
Although it was his work and the fruit of his imagination, he always gave his merits to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone
Upon landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors failed to save her life.
"Nadas kept calling and saying that the condition was really bad, not expected to survive," Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got a call from Nado, who called to say that she had two minutes to live and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I said goodbye.
I said to her, “Tashi, darling, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
Doctors gave drugs that supported her heartbeat, slowly stopped working and disappeared from the body.
She died a little earlier and that was the end of it all.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn’t sleep, cry or cry because I was surrounded by people and families.
I had to keep it to myself.”
Finally, Mr Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning his dead daughter, got on the plane with other passengers, not realizing what a difficult test she needs to overcome.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“My head was lowered and tears were shed all the time.
It’s hard to explain why, but it was on the plane that I felt great pity for Nadu.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Postcards of lamenting women aim to prevent suicides on bridges
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys on the Bridge of Wales are distributing cards with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call and ask for help.
Davis's son Tyler was 13 when he became depressed and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want one parent to feel the way I have to feel every day,” she said.
Mr. Davis, 45, who lives on board the plane, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile brightened the room.”
However, he threw the job before death because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found his dead brother.
Davis said: “I’m constantly afraid that a chain reaction might happen.”
Davis created the postcards “so that people know that there are people around who can be approached and spoken to, even if they are friends.
“Don’t sit still, you have to talk.”
Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mr. Davies, has lost his 15-year-old partner Mark, who retired shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed, depressed, and didn’t complain,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
During Christmas, the situation was completely bad: when the children wrapped up their gifts, he didn’t look them in the eye and didn’t react at all.”
She said his death was a huge trauma to them, but they have to overcome it: “In the family, it left a void.
It breaks our heart.
But we all have to go on and fight.”

The future of Bretto Kavanaugh hangs on his head after the FBI launches investigation
I thought if we could really get something he asked for – a limited-term and scope study – we might bring some unity,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would “be in the strong grips” of supporters.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to start an investigation?
Their opposition is determined only by time.
There are only five weeks left before the midterm elections, which will take place on November 6, and if the Republicans are expected to turn out badly, their efforts to elect the person they want to the highest court of the country will be greatly weakened.
George W. Bush called the senators in an effort to persuade them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cut ties and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
With Kim coming to power, the number of desertions in North Korea has “reduced”
The South Korean lawmaker said the number of North Korean desertions to South Korea had fallen when Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Unification Ministry, said 1,127 desertions were recorded last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the main factors were tightened controls on the North Korean-Chinese border and increased prices of human trafficking.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Many of North Korea’s deserts are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and which is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China regards desertions as illegal migrants rather than refugees, and often forcibly returns them to their homeland.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, where negotiations on nuclear disarmament were stalled.
That came after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, when the two essentially agreed to pursue a nuclear-free zone on the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of not changing its sanctions since then.
"If there is no trust in the United States, we will not be able to rely on our national security, and under such circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm first," Ri said at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi dismisses Brett Kavanaugh as "hysterical" and says he is not fit to serve in Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made these remarks during an interview with Austin, Texas, on Saturday at the Texas Tribune.
“I just can’t help but think that if a woman did that, she would be said to be hysterical,” Pelosi said in a statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of sexual assault against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his introductory speech, when he spoke about family and high school, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes uninitiated, or uninitiated.
He also denounced the former Democrats on the committee, calling the accusations he was accused of “grotesque and coordinated reputational destruction” by liberals who were angry at Hillary Clinton’s defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's evidence proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court because he revealed his bias against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself by his statements and by the Clintons and Democrats,” she said.
Asked whether he would seek to remove Kavanaugh if his candidacy were approved and Democrats received a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi objected.
"If he lies to Congress or the FBI, he is not fit to serve not only in the Supreme Court, but also in the court in which he is currently working," Pelosi said.
Mr. Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the District Court of Appeals of Colombia.
Pelosi added that she, as a Democrat, is concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions on the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case because he is considered a conservative judge.
During the approval hearings, Mr Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would reverse certain Supreme Court rulings.
“Now is not the time to say, hysterically, sideways to the personality, ‘How wonderful!’” said Pelosi.
The power that women should use
It is a legitimate criticism, a month-long and even year-long rage that she cannot express without tears.
“When we get angry, we cry,” Ms. Steinem told me after 45 years.
“It’s not unusual for me, is it for you?”
She continued: “I was very helped by a woman, the head of some company, who told me that she also cries when she is angry, but she created a method: angry and crying, she said to the man she was talking to at the time: ‘You may be crying because I’m sad.
I’m actually angry.”
And she just kept crying.
I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are considered an acceptable expression of anger in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories is of one of the first jobs in the office, where mostly men worked and where I once started crying because of inexhaustible anger. Then I was suffocated by an older woman, a tough boss, who always made a little bit of a pretense, and stretched it to the staircase.
“Never let them see you crying,” she said.
They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad, so they’ll be glad to beat you.”
Democratic Congresswoman Patricia Schroeder from Colorado worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught alienating on board the Monkey Business and withdrew his candidacy, Schroeder was deeply disappointed that there was no reason he could not run for president himself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” he told me laughingly after 30 years.
At that time, there were seven other candidates, so there was no need for another.
Someone called me "Snow White with Seven Dwarfs."
When the campaign started late, there was little time to raise funds, so she swore an unannounced candidacy until she raised $2 million.
It was an unequal struggle.
She noted that some sponsors who donated $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
“Maybe they thought I was getting a discount?” she asked.
In her speech announcing the start of a formal campaign, she was so embodied in emotions – people who supported gratitude, a system of disappointment that made it extremely difficult to raise funds and directly reach voters rather than representatives, and anger over sexism – that she was raving.
“You would think I was nervous,” Schroeder recalled in the press reaction to her speech.
– You would think that I am supported by the napkin business of Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what would be inscribed on my tombstone.
“She was crying?”
How the U.S. and China Trade Generation Can Benefit Beijing
The U.S.-China trade war has been raging, and while the battle is far from over, experts say, disagreement could ultimately benefit Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump gave his first warning earlier this year of taxing China’s main export products, including solar cells, steel and aluminum.
The sharpest confrontation came this week when new tariffs came into effect on goods valued at $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), i.e. essentially half of China's exports to the U.S. will be taxed.
Beijing responded by imposing a five to ten percent tariff on U.S. goods with a total value of $60 billion in the latest move.
China has vowed to fight the U.S. tooth for tooth, and it seems that the world’s second-largest market is not really going to land in the near future.
Washington would only ease sanctions if China obeyed the demands, but to publicly bow to the US would be too cumbersome for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing properly cripples its party, the difficulties of a trade war with the US could have a positive impact on China in the long run, as it will reduce the dependence of these markets on each other.
“The fact that a sudden political decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions that will cause the economy of both countries to deteriorate is actually much more dangerous than observers have so far acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher at the Asia New American Security Center.
Syria's Foreign Minister Says It's Ready to Accept Returning Refugees
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help in rebuilding a country that has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions were improving in the country.
"As progress has been made in the fight against terrorism, the situation in the area has become much more stable and safer," he said.
The government continues its efforts to restore the devastated areas of the terrorists and to restore the normal situation.
All conditions have already been created for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave behind because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions directed against their daily lives and well-being.
The UN estimates that Syria has left about 5.5 million Syrians since the start of the war in 2011.
The six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid to rebuild the devastated country.
However, it also stressed that the country would not accept conditional support or assistance from countries supporting the insurrection.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The European team, which knocked out the US team with a final score of 16.5:10.5, won the 2018 Ryder Cup at Le Golf National near Paris (France).
The US has lost for the sixth time in a row in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup on the continent since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn collected 14.5 points, which was enough to defeat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who has had a hard time throughout the tournament, fired a shot from the starting pitch straight into the water in the 3rd day of the 16th hole match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian player F. Molinari scored in all rounds and became one of four players to achieve a 5-0-0 score since 1979, when the tournament took on its current form.
The American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5-4 by the lowest-ranked European team player Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's top-ranked Dustin Johnson lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup tournament.
Spaniard Sergio Garcia has become the most successful European player of all time, scoring 25.5 career points in eight Ryder Cup tournaments.
“I rarely cry, but I can’t control myself today.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful to B. Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm very happy, very happy that we got the cup back.
It all depends on the team, and I’m glad I could help,” Garcia said emotionally after the Europeans’ victory.
He passes the reins to his native John Ram, who took down U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods in a 2-1 Sunday game.
“I’m incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods — I grew up watching him play,” Rahm, 23, said.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now holds the 13-21-3 Ryder Cup career record.
This is a strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, who has won the 14 biggest prizes and descends only on Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team failed to hit the drive all weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who demonstrated a high level of play throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after the team's disappointing appearance: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There was a moment this morning when we started pressuring the Europeans.
We walked.
I put my hat on Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 men and am proud to be their captain.
You have to bend your head.
Our opponents were superior to us."
