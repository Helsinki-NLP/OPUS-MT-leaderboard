Right-wing populists triumph in Austria, they have 29 percent in total
According to preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections in Austria brought a significant weakening of the two parties forming the current grand coalition, as well as a notorious strengthening of the populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (<0xC3><0x96>VP), where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously threatened, suffered particularly significant losses.
On the other hand, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZ<0xC3><0x96>), the Governor of Carinthia Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to the political scene at the national level.
According to preliminary results, the Socialists (SP<0xC3><0x96>) remain, with 29.8 percent of the votes, the country's leading political force, however, compared with the 2006 elections, they lost 5.5 percent of the votes.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP, which with 25.6 percent loses nearly nine percent of the vote, ended even worse.
These are the worst results of the two major post-war parties; especially for the People's Party, which triggered the early elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
Back in early July, when the <0xC3><0x96>VP left the coalition, the Popular Party had a considerable lead over the SP<0xC3><0x96>.
However, the voters visibly punished them for letting the government collapse.
From the first reactions to the results, speculation about the possible resignation of party leader and current deputy chancellor Wilhelm Molterer was uttered.
Observers believe that this could happen as early as Monday, during the extraordinary council of the party leadership.
Such an evolution would a priori facilitate the path towards the outcome of the election, which remains the most likely, namely the renewal of the large SP<0xC3><0x96> and <0xC3><0x96>VP coalition.
Nevertheless, given the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the Free (FP<0xC3><0x96>) would have obtained 18 percent and the BZ<0xC3><0x96> eleven percent of the votes - the Socialists at the same time expressed fear of a repeat of 1999, when the People's Party agreed with the populists (at the time, the FP<0xC3><0x96> itself was still a unified government, it was only in 2005 that the FP<0xC3><0x96> was united on the part of the
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to collaborate with any party and that he is planning to return to Vienna, on the national political scene, apparently put on this evolution.
The last party to have access to parliament was the Greens, but they lost slightly and fell back, among Austrian political parties, from third to fifth.
Clearly, no other party exceeded the four-percent limit and did not gain access to parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India are likely to cool down
If the problem of Czech researchers accused in India of illegal picking cockroaches could not be solved, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said there would be a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The minister declared it today in New York, after meeting his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem was not solved, then yes, a certain cooling would occur," he said after the meeting, which was held following a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee says, coming out of the talks, that the executive branch could hardly intervene in court cases.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>v<0xC3><0xA1>cha, who was discharged from the charge and punished with a fine, the central government could negotiate with the local government, that of Darjeling, the case being placed under the jurisdiction of the latter.
"His problem could be solved," said the minister.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher court.
Therefore, he could ask for bail and wait for the trial to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner also spoke in the same direction during the talks.
"He advises to appeal to a higher court, after which he could be pardoned," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide the convicts with "competent legal support," the Indian minister said.
He also said that such assistance had already been provided to them by India.
Above all, we want to maintain the best relations with India, which have a long-standing tradition.
The Indians also recognize it," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told <0xC4><0x8C>TK, he pointed out to his partner that the Czech Republic attached great importance to the problem of Czech entomologies.
“We regard the incarceration and indictment of these Czech researchers as a great contempt,” he said.
The minister shunned the question of whether he had received a promise from India to deal with the matter.
“I’ve already received quite a lot of promises,” he said.
A Czech arbiters the fight for the seabed
It approaches a walled electronic board, on which is represented Australia and the adjacent marine areas.
Now, he is not interested in the continent, but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
“The island belongs to Australia, as does the adjacent seabed.
This area is however as large as the continent itself," said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the team of thirty members of the UN Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea.
Its head, the director of the division, the Czech jurist V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Mikulka, follows the presentation and completes it from time to time.
The passion at work and enthusiasm characterize the prevailing atmosphere.
The seabed hides a little known world so far, rich in natural resources.
Oil, minerals and other mineral resources can be found there, but also living organisms that are currently unknown, which may hold the key to the development of a cancer drug.
A more vast bottom than the earth
The coastal states have nowadays begun to vehemently aspire to the new underwater territories.
According to a UN convention, they exercise their rights, which they agreed on in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of what is called the continental shelf, which often extends several hundred kilometers from the coast of the given country.
The latter may, according to the convention, claim exclusively all the resources of the continental shelf.
"To simplify, the continental shelf is considered the part of the seabed and its subsoil, which constitutes a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the limits of the coastal sea, often also beyond the two hundred nautical miles that represent the so-called exclusive economic yone,” Mikulka explains.
The request that the country in question submits to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by extensive scientific and technical documentation, based on numerous prospecting and costly metresis.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide the Commission with legal and scientific-technical assistance.
To date, the Commission has dealt with five requests, from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries mentioned have been successful," Mikulka added.
Australia's success, which is the first to have significantly expanded its underwater holdings, has recently seen a global resounding.
New Zealand, too, gained territory - the extent of the seabed, which was assigned to it by the commission last week, corresponds to 1.6 million square kilometers, which is the extent of the country multiplied by six.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in prospecting.
The benefits they will reap in the future from the exploitation of the seabed will, as they project, be invaluable.
Gradually, other countries will, in turn, submit their requests.
They can do so within ten years after they have ratified the "Montego Bay Convention".
There, where the continental shelf ends, begins the zone of the ocean floor, proclaimed by convention "common heritage of humanity".
There, no state enjoys an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this zone is granted by an international institution established by convention.
"Nevertheless, we are not mistaken, the seabed is not a Klondike," Mikulka said, exaggerating the director, adding that "their areas are precisely clearly defined and their regime is anchored in a contract."
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed now also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other States of the former Eastern bloc within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
It obtained in 1991, under the Convention, as well as from investors from a few other States, the status of what is called "a pioneer investor".
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area prospected by the investor slightly exceeds the area of the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is turbulent, it is a kind of underwater replica of the Tatras.
"It is possible to extract it on an area with a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area represents a deposit rich in polymetallic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," said Ind Pakshi Rajan, another lawyer.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, provides an example of such a concretization.
It resembles a small potato, or, with a little imagination, the mythical shoem, which, according to the legend, animated the Golem.
German special forces were on the scene for the release of the hostages
The Egyptian government had asked for help from Germany for the resolution of the hostage crisis - experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special units stood ready, but they never went into action.
More and more details on the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists abducted in Egypt are revealed.
According to the indications of the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence, the German special forces also participated indirectly in the rescue operation.
Thus, both specialists from the Federal Army and officials from GSG 9, the Federal Police Air Squadron and the Federal Criminal Police Office, as well as logistics experts from the Technische Hilfwerk, were at the site of the release.
As the ministry spokeswoman said on Monday night, German forces were ultimately not required, with hostages freeing their prisoners and fleeing when they recognized the imminent release by force.
The Egyptian government would have accepted the assistance offered by Germany to integrate it on the ground as a support force.
“Fortunately, this has not happened so far,” said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The attackers had kidnapped in southern Egypt the group of tourists consisting of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian and their eight Egyptian escorts.
Following their abduction in the desert in southern Egypt, the hostages were trans-ported to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage-takers has so far remained vague, as have details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Those who have been rescued have meanwhile arrived safe and sound in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were under the protection of the German embassy.
He said nothing about the details of the release.
In Berlin at the moment, no information has been given about the date of their return to Germany.
According to the magazine "Bild", the five holidaymakers and special forces are expected to take off on board an Airbus of the Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives rejects rescue plan
The U.S. Congressional First Chamber has failed little in its $700 billion bailout plan.
The Dow Jones descended into the abyss.
With 227 votes to 206, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the bailout plan in favor of the government’s financial markets.
Despite all the calls from U.S. President George W. Bush and politicians at the head of both parties, the program that was supposed to wreak havoc on the financial markets did not gain a majority.
In a dramatic maneuver, the partisans had desperately tried to convince opponents of the well-founded $700 billion plan.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic representatives during the debates, had called for MPs to vote in favour although the plan was unpopular.
“It’s hard to have political recognition for avoiding something that hasn’t happened yet,” he said.
During the vote, the Dow Jones fell by more than six percent, or 600 points.
The reason for this was investors’ concern that the state bailout plan might overturn.
It went back a short time before the end of the vote, and then, after the announcement of the failure, fall again.
Experts are now projecting further serious turbulence in international financial markets.
In order for the program to enter into force, the approval of both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate is required.
Organizers report increasing number of bookings
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
In terms of bookings for the coming months, according to a study, the turnover increased significantly compared to the previous year - for the winter season, even by more than 30 percent.
Despite weak economic prospects, the Germans’ thirst for travel remains unsatisfactory, according to this study.
With regard to bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a turnover of more than 31 percent compared to the same period the previous year, as the German Federation of Travel Agencies (DRV) confided in Berlin on Monday.
According to the survey of the GfK Market Research Institute, increasing numbers of bookings already dominate the autumn months.
Thus, the number of sales would have climbed to about 11 percent more than in 2007, the DRV said.
The sources of these results are figures from the GfK, which analyses the booking data of 1,200 travel agencies on a monthly basis and makes estimates for the global market.
Travel bookings made since the end of August 2008 would be recorded there.
Due to the low dollar price, trips to the US would be particularly in demand, said the DRV.
There, the increase in reservations would amount to about one Third Party.
Besides this, Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as our country would be destinations particularly sought after by the Germans.
Organised trips are particularly in demand, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
Given the rising prices of energy and food products, the costs here would be "more easily computable for the customer than for an individually organized trip".
Consumers can save money, among other things, with early booking discounts or All Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months have also been very picky so that an increase in sales figures will again be recorded compared to last year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who undertook a trip has fallen compared to the previous year.
My first time at the Beer Festival
The hits of Ballermann or Apres-Ski continuously, from beer in pitches to liters and celebrities in Tyrolean designer costumes.
An event at the Beer Festival.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I don't actually have much in common.
She is a blonde, TV animator and wears a tailor-made Tyrolean suit.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is used.
But one thing connects us: barely three minutes to the beer party, and already the photographers are throwing themselves at us and filling their memory card - very flattering, and this on my first visit to the beer party.
That's how we make friends.
The cheap Tyrolean costume seems to achieve its goal.
As a beer-party tourist and normally living north of the Weißwurst equator, my sense of well-being in traditional costume was so far limited.
But once in Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se Square, everything is half as bad.
Everyone or almost everyone wears a Tyrolean suit or leather pants; no one looks blazed or affected by shame - this is completely normal.
Only the apron of my Tyrolean costume collects a few odd eye shots at the banana-choco stand.
A Bavarian woman makes me notice that I would have attached my apron wrongly: "on the left means free, in the middle virgin, on the right cased, on the back widow."
Discreetly, I tripped my buckle from the back to the left.
"It's better," she said and laughed.
Others don’t give themselves as much trouble for these subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felts, on which it is written “Too drunk to get dressed!” and exposes us their naked butt without being invited.
The young man in the exhibitionist attitude is called Bob, comes from England and comes for the first time to the beer party.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a "oooo" elongated.
He told me all this after he was relieved of the chop he had drunk before.
Right next to that fire mouth that everyone thinks is a trash can.
Bob is therefore one of those sadly famous "wildcats".
Others do not have the chance to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At around eight o'clock in the evening, rescuers run into the party square and have to take care of the poor drinkers.
The nurses intervene rather in a pack - always by four, they drag their crib covered with tents into tents.
This is how it works for most visitors to the beer festival: we go empty, we come full.
Those who rest in the coffin of the drunkards under the tarpaulin are not visible.
"They're the ones who can't swallow anything anymore," one of the rescuers yells at me in response to my question and then disappears into the melee.
Victim of accident identified by police
A 63-year-old pedestrian who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle has been identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road to Brentwood, was involved in the Friday afternoon crash in the city on Shenfield Road.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but died there.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Turkey has broadened its diplomatic horizons.
Long before Turkey thought of joining the European Union, the European powers were eager to enter its hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, 20 steps away from Asia, is one of the finest relics of his fallen imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed in a neo-renaissance style by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
At least that’s what the guides tell us.
The monument is arranged on horseback at the bottom of the platforms, equipped with an observation tower at each of its angles, like some German provincial town halls.
The stones are dirty.
The whole building is in ruins.
But once inside the vaulted ticket office, we no longer have any doubts about the size of the company, which represents a passage to the west.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by a German association, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, lagging behind in the game of imperialism, wanted to realize its medieval ambitions of domination thanks to this railway that arrives in Damascus, Baghdad as well as the land better known as Saudi Arabia.
But German imperialist ambitions collapsed during the First World War.
His railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab irregulars.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, engendered by the icy borders of the Cold War, is over.
The British and the Empire's forces advanced beyond Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there was also bad news for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a train loaded with ammunition exploded destroying its subtle roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly fallen into ruin, engulfed in the meanders of history.
But today, the railway crossing to Anatolia and all the eastern points, at least symbolically, serves to underline the expansion of Turkey's diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, generated by the icy borders of the Cold War
Now is the time for a new policy of commitments.
The Turkish government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I embarked on a wagon-bed in the direction of the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit Turkish AKP MP Su<0xC3><0xA2>t Kiniklioglu, one of the foreign policy experts.
The next morning, after a ten-and-a-half-hour journey, shaken on noisy rails whose cadence reminded me of the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived in the Turkish capital – presented as a new city of a new century-old state, turning its back on its German past.
But the AKP, with its well-known Islamist roots, is an example of a change in Turkish consensus.
He suspected the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra modern structure, expressly built in stone and steel, in a developing district, surrounded by semi-constructed shopping centers and many pastries in which the middle managers in costume-ties-men and women- meet for morning business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could have been a centre-right politician from any other party in Europe.
Costume, tie and he even has a Black Berry.
The aim of this foreign policy is to now reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly,” he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its back country.
Now she has to look east and west at the same time.
This was not the case for either of them.
She had to do both.
“But then, at some point, I asked if Turkey shouldn’t choose.”
“Turkey,” he said, “does not want to have to choose between the two.”
He then pointed out an aspect that almost everyone with whom I have been able to speak, told me heartily: The Turkish railway goes not only to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea, so it is as much an advantage for Europe and the United States as for Turkey itself.
With the integration of Turkey, the message seems to draw a Europe traveling metaphorically on the rails to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at the Hydarpasha station, after another sleepless night, I thought about these two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that the European ambitions of the Middle East could, in large part, be in the hands of Turkey.
While I was waiting at the terminal, the ferry to cross the Bosphorus, I remembered the period when Turkey had been called "the sick man of Europe".
At least, there is no longer any doubt about the continent that could claim this fascinating country.
Memoirs of Vernon Handley, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: Music director at Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (died September 11) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Already part of his musical project for the city, he founded the following year, the fantastic youth choir, Proteus.
The choir was supposed to include those under 21, but before Proteus could sing his last song in 1979, many of us who were over 20 refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (which changed shape according to mythology) represented the will and ability of the choir to manage any type of music was presented to him, whether madrigal or Messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often impressive, always exciting, thanks to the inspiration of a single man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remained constant over the years.
Remember how Tod told us to “let the music speak for itself.”
He would have said, "The composer knows what he wants."
Everything is there, in the music.
Sing it!"
His wand technique was absolutely clear, precise, even if never dictatorial or appearing.
Whatever the musical standard, he raised it a lot higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a driver was to be knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the decades from 1962 to 1982, when he was driving the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I have seen more than a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them have ever disappointed me, and sometimes they have even inspired me.
Tod Handley seldom held this combination of personal greatness and modesty.
He hated drivers who, according to him, "focus only on certain people."
He will be missed by many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary of William Woodruff (died September 25) states that "in 1946 he had resumed his studies in economic history, at Oxford, and in 1950 became a member of Houblon-Norma research, while doing a BSc, an MA and a PhD".
That’s what Woodruff’s letter in Beyond Nab End says, but that’s not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at the same time completed a PhD thesis on the British plastics industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; it was then published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
In the 1950s and 1950s in the United States, he studied at Houblon Norman, and in the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to hide this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend José Vicente Resino's exhibition 'The Flamenco and Life' because his black and white photographs, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They have attracted my attention because of their simplicity and the strength they convey and because they always treat the protagonists with a lot of respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments.”
Second Attack for Honda Supersales
In November, Honda will begin marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
If its predecessor already had a good habitability, this new monovolume has an even wider interior space.
In addition, there are some refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more gasoline.
An evolution in the face of a revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Honda Jazz presents a line very similar to the previous model, the changes introduced in this minivan are numerous.
Among them, there is an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before looking at the new model, it should be noted that this new Honda Jazz comes six years after the first generation was launched on the market.
First of all, it is noted that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than that of other manufacturers.
Although in Europe the Honda Jazz is less well known, this model is a phenomenon of sales in other markets.
This is the case in Japan, where the Honda Jazz was the most commercialized car in 2002 and also in 2008.
In Japan, nearly one million Honda Jazzs have been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with more or less one million cars sold in six years, is in second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow it to increase its sales in Europe.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese brand marketed 83,000 Honda Jazz, in 2009 it expects to sell 100,000, which would represent a 17% increase in sales in the European market.
In the Spanish market, Honda has marketed 8,000 Jazz since 2002, which represents 6.7% of Honda's sales in Spain.
The head of the Spanish subsidiary hopes to sell 2,000 Jazz in a year.
It is precisely the release of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to largely offset the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, brand officials hope to end the year with sales of 22,000 cars, i.e. 4,000 fewer cars than in 2007, a 16% drop in sales.
Thanks to this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese brand also hopes to gain a market share of 2% in 2010.
Honda hopes to get that market share when the new model comes out.
This is the Insight, a five-door hybrid with a compact size - 4.37 meters in length - on which the Japanese company hopes to market nearly 200,000 cars per year worldwide.
Depending on the markets and according to the Japanese manufacturer's estimates, 50% of Insight's sales will be in the United States, while the remaining half will be distributed between the Old Container and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is scheduled for the first three months of next year, following its presentation to the public in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz increases its dimensions.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), its width 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the distance between its axes is 2.50 meters which represents an increase of five centimeters.
On the other hand, the height does not change to 1.52 meters.
The dimensions increase and the interior space as well.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of a gasoline reserve in a central position, a solution also adopted for the Honda Jazz.
In the same way, the capacity of the trunk – which has a double-bottom system – can hold up to 399 liters, 19 liters more capacity compared to the first-generation trunk.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, since the capacity of the trunk of the Honda Jazz 1.2L is 379 liters.
The other innovation - in addition to the exterior elements such as the rear lights or the panoramic roof - is the improvement of access to the rear seats.
The doors that give access to the rear seats have an opening angle of 80 degrees, relative to the back doors of the first Jazz that opened with an angle of 67 degrees.
The engines are also new on this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model will be equipped with two 1.2-litre and 1.4-litre gasoline engines.
Both engines feature i-VTEC technology that reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, makes the engine more powerful and increases engine speed.
The first 1.2-litre engine develops 90 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 114 Nm of torque at 4,900 rpm.
This engine - which on the previous Jazz reached 78 horses - has a fuel consumption of 5.3 liters per 100 km and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous engine, which on the previous generation reached 83 horses, now reaches 100 horses.
This Honda Jazz 1.4L 100 horsepower has a combined consumption of 5.4 liters per 100 km and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bee car' that avoids collisions
To advance the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan has been inspired, this time, by nature, especially bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, by imitating the theft of bees, avoids accidents.
It is called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C and represents the first steps towards collision prevention technologies.
The engineers at Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technical Center designed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Brand Management Research and Development, the BR23C represents the rise of Nissan’s security shield.
This robot will allow the brand’s vehicles to prevent collisions.
During its flight, each bee creates its own personal space of an oval shape that closely resembles the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the bee's compound eyes, able to see at an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, allowing him to fly without interruption inside his own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, the engineers developed what is called a laser range finder.
The latter detects obstacles that lie over a distance of two meters and within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to this object and sends a signal to the microprocessor, immediately, to avoid the obstacle.
“As soon as it detects an obstacle, the small robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by forking its wheels 90 degrees or more to avoid collision.
The biggest difference from any other existing system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
If that were the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Moving Laboratory and principal engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be diverted upwards or downwards, nor diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and according to what its wheels allow it and not in infinite directions like bees.
For this reason, Nissan used a function of rotation, but also of acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot could avoid obstacles.
“Every second this device should only process information and act on that data.
It does not need to retain the information or intuitive logic of prior maneuvers, which is why it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This may come as a surprise, but we’re not talking about gigabytes of memory, or even megabytes.”
This represents the first development of new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology that will be introduced in standard cars in about a decade after Nissan.
The robot works with lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
The other possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device on a GPS navigation satellite system to guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
They are afraid of being mortgaged.
It must be recognized that the U.S. Treasury, in addition to having a lot of cash to make plans, is not without genius.
Faced with the crisis, and in order to prevent Americans from embarking on mortgages with solvency banks, they created a game to learn not to go bankrupt: ‘Bad Credit Hotel’.
That's to say 'the Hotel of bad credits'... or stories.
The grim aspect of this accommodation and especially of the Hotel Ma<0xC3><0xAE>tre d'H<0xC3><0xB4>tel leads us to think several times if it is the right time to apply for a loan.
And, most importantly, where to do it.
It is certain that this game gives useful information but not detailed.
It’s more of a game for teenagers.
What to do if the game ends?
Since a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It is better than nothing, since it is unthinkable to buy a house

Morgan Stanley has announced the entry into its roundtable of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan's first bank, which will disburse nine billion dollars to take 21% of its capital, a new one welcomed by a sharp decline in its stock market price.
A week after unveiling a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s ordinary shares at a unit price of $25.25, a total of $3 billion.
The retained price is 19% lower than the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible securities with a return of 10% and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley said the overall transaction would be based on an average unit price of $29, or 28% above its current price.
Morgan Stanley’s stock, however, lost 6.79% at $23.07 around 17:00 GMT.
“This strategic alliance represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to banking holding status,” said John Mack, the group’s chief executive officer.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow it to diversify its activities but put it under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing Wall Street’s biggest names to adopt a much more cautious attitude than before.
The terms presented on Monday also show that the deal has been changed in recent days: Last Monday, Morgan had simply announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares to the Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, explained in Tokyo, "we thought that the participation would be composed entirely of ordinary shares.
But given the current situation of the economy and the market, we wanted to minimize the risks and cover ourselves."
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley shares 7% below their book value.
And the operation will result in a dilution of about 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares within a year if they are exchanged more than 50% above the conversion price, or at about $47, during a given period.
Morgan Stanley said MUFG's capital will allow it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A group spokeswoman, however, declined to elaborate on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to have a Tier One solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said it had "clearly" lightened its balance sheet since late August.
The last few weeks have been arduous for the group, which saw its stock market price slump by half as the cost of insurance against a default risk on its debt hovered.
This cost rebounded on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other “survivor” of major Wall Street investment banks after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, announced it had raised $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
Refounding the republic around 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like his counterparts and friends, he was the third to put to the vote a draft new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since 64% of voters voted "yes" in the referendum, according to official results covering 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" got 28%, 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% were white votes.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to get half the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the exit polling stations and an account by a non-governmental organization had announced a broad "yes" victory, placing it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had claimed the victory of his draft constitution in the night of Sunday to Monday.
The "Constitution has triumphed overwhelmingly," he said, congratulating Ecuadorians at the headquarters of the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez and Morales but also his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which took place quietly according to the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), concerned a 444-point text consolidating the "new socialism" defended by the president.
The draft Constitution enshrines the power of the state over the economy, reserving it the "development planning" of a country living mainly from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and the currencies that its emigrants send.
Supported by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants enhanced powers to the Head of State, who will be able to serve up to two consecutive four-year terms and have the opportunity to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and will seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution further consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President began to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It finally provides for a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for US anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages have been released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts held captive for ten days in the desert were brought back safely to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been released by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived around 3:30 p.m. aboard a special aircraft at al-Maza military base, docked at Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, without being able to speak to the press, on board helicopters to the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, for examinations.
They are in "good health," and "no ransom has been paid" to the kidnappers," Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said on the tarmac.
Captured on 19 September during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this hostage group had been sacked from one hiding place to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Egyptian agency, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, transported on board two helicopters, had launched the assault in the night just before dawn.
“An exchange of shots has occurred, and half of the kidnappers have been killed, the others fleeing,” said the official, who requested anonymity.
He said that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "blitz" unit had been sent to Sudan, where they received the support of German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini mentioned from Belgrade, where he is, the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our secret service, special forces," he said, without further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted during a patrol a 4x4 vehicle on which the kidnappers were, killing six, including the Chadian leader, and arresting two.
The army claimed they were linked to a Darfur rebel group, the Sudan-Unity Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which the movement immediately denied.
Letters - The Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture is at the forefront of the current election campaign.
All the better.
But one aspect of our cultural life is always forgotten.
Who will rise up to denounce the sums of misery that are given to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical places that are starving?
Which politician will dare remind the federal government that it neglects its monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we do not have real laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government is devoting three and a half million euros to the restoration of the only Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
In our American neighbors, it is written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of the Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected representatives and all government departments, and this, in consultation.
In Quebec, the Federation of Quebec History Societies, at least 40,000 volunteers in 211 history, heritage, archival and genealogy societies are concerned with exploring history, preserving with three under private archival mounds and preserving archaeological remains.
They are often the watchdogs of our heritage, protesting with the energy of despair when promoters and decision-makers launch their bulldozers against our old stones and our forgotten cemeteries.
When, a tribune for history and heritage?
The governments of the Benelux nationalize a part of the bank Fortis
The Benelux states are helping the Belgian-Dutch bank, as the first European banking institution in distress following the snowball effect of the credit market crisis in the United States, by partially nationalizing it. The three countries are supporting, with a sum of 11.2 billion euros, this financial and insurance institution as well.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourgish and Dutch governments agreed, at the highest level, on this issue, also appealing to the European Central Bank and the European Commission's competition officer.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the international financial crisis, which has been escalating for more than a year, is for Fortis Bank. In a certain sense, the decisions that will be taken in the case of this bank will serve as a precedent.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night, the three states will buy almost half (up 49%) of the bank’s capital in each of the countries.
The bank is undoubtedly going to sell some of its holdings, among which, in the first place, the activities, mainly insurance, that it acquired last year from the Dutch organization ABN Amro.
Last week, Fortis shares began a dizzying fall. In the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis have already been revealed at the bank.
Analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is far too big to be allowed to go bankrupt.
Only on Friday, the company’s shares fell 12 percent, to its lowest level of 14 years ago.
Since January, stocks have fallen by more than two-thirds of their value.
Taking into account the current value of the shares, the total value of the group's capital is around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion, which, according to the company's leaders, is not realistic.
The company’s management accuses the uncertainty of the over-Atlantic, related to the adoption of the US $700 billion bailout plan, of being at the root of the crash of Fortis shares.
On Monday, the papers have already benefited from a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed head of the bank, as the new CEO.
The financial institution was also looking for private buyers, but has not yet received a proposal on the substance.
Previously, the Belgian government announced that investors should not worry, they will not lose their money.
No panic was felt in the customer circle of the bank and no agency was attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent agencies and has also acquired leasing companies.
A fox in the chicken coop
In America, life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate, based on information about their drug purchases.
Information protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that link the use of information about the prescription of medicines, in all cases, to the consent of the person concerned.
This kind of program must be in independent hands, otherwise it means entrusting your chicken to a fox," Richard Dicket, the creator of the program used to manage prescription drugs, told the Washington Post.
Insurance companies make the insurance premium and the insured capital dependent on the health of the client, and if they feel that the risk is too high, they do not even insure it.
In the past, they sent the candidates for a medical examination, and they only signed an insurance contract with them after becoming aware of the results.
For ten years, Dick has found a much cheaper procedure: from an identification number, he easily provides himself with pharmacies, data about the purchase of drugs of the person in the past eighteen months. From this, the program determines itself, what disease the person suffers from and what is his state of health.
For example, if this person regularly buys high doses of cholesterol lowering, it refers to an extremely high level of fat in the blood, which immediately puts them in a higher risk category.
Several versions of this program are in circulation. Some at the same time determine a risk factor, so there is not much left to do to the insurer other than paperwork. However, minor problems may still appear.
Among the disadvantages of this program is the fact that a drug can be used for different purposes. For example, some mixtures can be used against migraine or against hot flashes, but can also be effective against depression.
The latter is considered by insurers as an aggravating risk factor, while others do not.
Companies have developed in the research and analysis of data. They must ask the patient for permission before collecting the necessary information from the pharmacy.
From now on, they are constrained by the authorities, even if they have not been sanctioned for their failures in the past.
Recently, some companies have also been processing the results of laboratory analyses, linking them with data on drug use, and are able to provide an even more accurate picture of patients' health status.
More and more companies have access to data, and control of use is also becoming increasingly difficult.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope extends only to practitioners and insurers.
A bill to broaden the scope of government control over companies specializing in data provision is currently before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is not enough and that is why he has further developed his program, which would condition the transmission of data to the exclusive agreement of the person concerned.
It is another question of whether the person concerned is really free to give his consent or not, since if he refuses, the insurance companies do not sign an insurance contract with him.
Thus, and ultimately, chickens depend on the benevolence of the fox.
The global menu of Marseille
The European Union and India are doubling their trade.
Since the European Union and India are very important trading partners for each other, this theme also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit alongside the other problems, largely global.
Today, a France-India summit will also take place, where cooperation in the field of atomic energy will be the main issue.
The European Union recognizes that India is a major emerging democratic power that should be given a broader right to speak in international affairs, but member countries have not yet managed to agree on their support for New Delhi for its candidacy as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
They were not too late on this issue yesterday at this 9th summit in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as the current President of the Union, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and the Head of Diplomacy, Javier Solana, welcomed the Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in five years, they would double the good trade of a hundred.
Given that trade in goods has increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this does not appear to be an overly ambitious objective.
In this sense, they have legally harmonized the 26 bilateral conventions with India on civil flights, so that air traffic can also grow in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy has promised to speed up negotiations.
The aim is to balance the situation with India, which is the EU's first trading partner, and New Delhi, which is only ninth among the EU's partners.
The summit focused its attention on global affairs.
The Afghan and Pakistani situation was strongly condemned, as well as all forms of terrorism, and the urgency of holding a United Nations conference on this subject was discussed.
The completion of the Doha trade cycle has also been called for, although both play a large part in the current failure.
The EU has confirmed that it remains committed to the energy and climate agenda, including that it would like to reduce its toxic emissions by at least twenty per cent by 2020.
India also agreed on this point, along with the fact that a global market would have to pass at the climate conference scheduled next year, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by fifty percent by 2050.
They also wished to prevent food prices from rising, and supported the convening of an international working meeting to discuss the financial crisis.
The Indian head of state is on his way to the French capital today, where he is preparing to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders worth 20 billion euros for the construction of Indian nuclear reactors.
According to the news agency, the agreement would last for 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers attend the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international event in the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair is waiting for this edition, with more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 different countries occupying the 171,790 square meters of the fair with more than 403 thousand titles on display, and Turkey as a guest of honor.
It will be the Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Cultural Property and Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government at the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Butterfly: indeed, Italy will be present in an institutional way, with a Point Italy - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will be followed by the press meeting in the Room Struktur, at butterfly 5.0 of the Buchmesse: an opportunity to present the figures, trends and prospects on the position of the edition in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign author books gradually decreases in relation to the total Italian production, and in particular, in relation to that for adults and children.
Found Steve Fossett's plane, the billionaire disappeared a year ago.
The wreckage of Steve Fosset's plane, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, has been found.
The debris was found on a plateau 3,000 meters above sea level in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammonth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, however, no human remains.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson said: “The plane has been located, we have sent a team, and now we have confirmation that this is the one Steve Fosset was traveling on the day he disappeared.”
The sheriff said no human remains were found on or near the plane.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was considered dead.
The U.S. Bureau of Transportation Safety (Ntsb) said that a team of investigators sent to the scene a few hours after the wreckage was spotted, they identified the aircraft: the Bellanca 8kcab, which disappeared on September 3, 2007, when Fosset took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fosset’s personal belongings were found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents bearing the name of Fosset, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweater.
Fossett's search was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of records.
By the sixth attempt, he had become in 2002, the first man to complete the world tour on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he had traveled the world by plane and without a stopover.
Among all these records, also that of having flown at 15,445 meters in height, on the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertisement you're not expecting.
An unusual 4x4 of an original and well-defined design, with marked lines, wide surfaces and sharp angles.
Here, in summary, Glk, the last born of the "compact" off-road of the house of the star, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a wind of novelty in this sector.
Due to its out-of-the-box, unexpected and unconventional content will be the communication that will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms, from October 17th.
Thus, the advertising battle that will accompany the start of the new car will give rise to an unprecedented mode of communication, through a futuristic campaign of 3D displays, used for the first time in Italy by an automobile brand.
A project of maxi displays, articulated in three different phases, which will dominate the heart of Milan's shopping, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication provides for the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, we will have the impression that when looking at the image, the car comes out of the poster.
Then, through the use of innovative technology ELIMA8, the new Glk will be illuminated according to the spots, in all its details, and then recompose into a single image.
It is obvious that with this advertising, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new in the stereotypical field of automotive communication.
Will it succeed in attracting the interest of future acquirers with this formula? We will see.
These are the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 young boys and girls whom Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been following the Italian national team for years, and which, until now, had never created big problems.
Nor had he ever clashed with the opposing fans.
The extraction of the group is to the right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (little in reality) from Campania and Apulia were added.
They had tricolored flags on which their hometown appeared: Saturday night, they were all abducted for not being identified.
They are inspired by the English cheerleading.
In Bulgaria, they found a fanfare of real Nazis, that of Levski.
Figc had made available to Italian fans 144 tickets for the game: all nominal, and therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminal had in fact all controlled them: among those who left for Sofia, none had a Daspo in progress, none had been forbidden to attend a stadium.
Four Italian fans who had a history of stadium crime, were not entitled to the ticket, and could not make the trip.
Now the Viminal is waiting to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police, and then will take action: in this case, it could be that the fans arrested or identified in the disorders purge a Daspo for at least five years .
An international Daspo that prohibits attending Italian, but also European stadiums.
In short, our hooligans will no longer set foot in the stadium.
Thankfully.
But now it is time for fear-emulation: that is to say, others are likely to add to the first one hundred and fifty.
"We must put out this fire immediately, and not legitimize who is behaving like this," Viminal said.
So, "keep your eyes open especially in view of Wednesday's national team game in Lecce"
In Apulia there is indeed a small core of supporters of the Ultras Italy.
Tomorrow, the Observatory meets, Tuesday the Casms, which can even count on a section of the Aisee, that is, secret services, who deal precisely with the problems of the stadium.
"The Duce-Duce choirs, and the arm stretched out during the anthem of Mameli? In Bulgaria, it is not a crime"
Here is the opinion (expressed in a really unpleasant way) of Domenico Mazzilli, recently director of the Viminal Observatory (he took the post of Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was formerly prefect in Trieste, where a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002, resides.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria, renting Mussolini is not a crime, but it is certain that the behavior of these 150-200 typhoons was shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - adds the number 1 of the Observatory - crimes must be attributed in the country in which the fact occurs.
Until now, this group had remained in the rules, now we will see well what happened, and we will evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about the whistles towards the anthem of Mameli: those are not crimes either, but if you allow me, they are not polite..."
