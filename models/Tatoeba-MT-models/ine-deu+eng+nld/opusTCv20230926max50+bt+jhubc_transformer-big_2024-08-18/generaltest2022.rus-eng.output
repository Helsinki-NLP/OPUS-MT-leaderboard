From my point of view, the literature program was formed by ladies of Balzac age on the basis of their interests.
From the Russian literature of the 19th century, we preferred Danilevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote fiction, of course, from the point of view of the same ladies of the Balzac age.
And the psychology and torture of Tolstoy and Turgenev are not so interesting for teenagers.
Teenagers are rarely interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very much, very interesting.

Germany: Fourth Coronavirus Vaccine Unavoidable
A fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or autumn of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be final, but will continue with new force.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of the coronavirus vaccine are likely to be sufficient for full protection.
Ulrich Weigeldt, head of the Association of General Practitioners, is convinced of this.
This was reported by Die Welt on Saturday, December 11.
“We expect that the fourth vaccination will be needed in the summer, at the latest in the autumn,” the expert said.
In addition, Weigeldt hopes that the fourth coronavirus vaccination can be carried out "in combination with influenza vaccination."
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, increased vaccination can help fight the spread of the new strain of the coronavirus "Omicron".
The new version is particularly dangerous.
Thus, the probability of re-infection with "Omicron" is three times higher than in Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, BioNTech/Pfizer manufacturers plan to provide a vaccine adapted for Omikron by March 2022.
The companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new variant of the coronavirus "Omicron".
A study by BioNTech and Pfizer found that with two doses of the vaccine, efficacy is significantly lower: “neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times.”
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the micron strain," BioNTech and Pfizer said in a statement.
A third dose is needed.
Experts insist on accelerating the pace of vaccination in the country.
For example, the president of the German Society of Infectious Diseases, Bernd Salzberger, is in favour of shortening the interval between the second and third vaccinations.
Moreover, according to Salzberger, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the micron variant of the coronavirus.
“Israel’s experience shows this very convincingly,” the expert said.
Wobbler Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21<0xC2><0xAE>.
It (as well as the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibes in that it was originally created to be used for sub-glacial fishing, not just for pozabros.
These vibes have a greater weight than those close to the size of analogues, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuances of the application of these interesting bait.
Another recognisable feature is the upper fin made of durable and elastic plastic, which creates additional shades of vibration in vertical and horizontal wiring.
As a "winter vibe" when caught in the scales Bet-A-Vib demonstrates a rather aggressive game.
Often the most catchy is a simple monotonous animation, that is, movements of the diver up and down almost without pauses.
When planning the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when catching in a limited space, clogged underwater vegetation, crusts and other obstacles for which a catch is possible.
In addition, a small deviation is relevant when catching a bait in winter and a large bait, and especially in the middle of winter, when a punctual and aggressive bait supply is required.
Upon reaching the extreme point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly unfolds and returns to the original vertical.
No less successful Bet-A-Vib is also used for the winter catch of pond trout.
To please her whims, you can choose from two modifications: with a sound capsule (NS – NanoSound) or without it (SL – Silent).
It is also noted that Bet-A-Vib can irritate a passive hook, not responding even to the nerve.
When caught, Bet-A-Vib displays range and accuracy.
This wobbler is understandable and not whimsical, it is well combined with lace and woven cords even of large diameters.
For catching lizards, lizards, eels or stingrays other than evenly relevant and "step", sometimes with "squirting" to the bottom.
If you are hunting in hardy places, you can change the front t-shirt to a double, which will reduce the likelihood of catches.
Among the bait of its class Bet-A-Vib among the most stable in work and, as a consequence, one of the most catchy.
With the same success, it can be used both on relatively small and on fairly deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.

In Libya said about 7 thousand Russian mercenaries
There are more than 7,000 mercenaries of the private military company Wagner in Libya.
This was stated on Sunday, December 12, the chairman of the Supreme State Council of the Republic Khaled al-Mishri.
“Currently, there are more than 7,000 Wagner mercenaries in Libya.
They also have planes.
They also dig trenches in Sirte and Cuffra.
They have 30 jet planes at Gardabia airbases (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte),” Anadolu Agency quoted him as saying.
Khaled al-Mishri also pointed out that Russian mercenaries are “trying to capture” the central part of Libya stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after “bringing their man to power” in the Central African Republic.
Retain Presence
According to the newspaper’s interlocutor, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and “relocated to Libya”.
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using an airbase and port in Sirte, as well as an airbase in Jufra, the agency said in a statement.
The Russian authorities officially deny that the Wagner Center has the support of the Kremlin.
Where else can mercenaries be?
According to the agency, Wagner is believed to operate in nine countries in Africa - the CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training of local forces, personal protection of leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses for the use of minerals and natural resources, as well as for the supply of weapons, technology and military services to these countries.
According to the media, the “Wagners” allegedly fought in the Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and the Tsar.
This group is not listed in the law enforcement agencies or in the register of lawyers, and its fighters are not on the formal lists of personnel.
This company is under U.S. sanctions.
Earlier, the EU’s 27 member states approved restrictions against Wagner.
The decision is expected to be adopted by the Council of the European Union on 13 December.
The situation in Libya
The Supreme State Council of Libya is de facto the second chamber of parliament with consultative functions with its dominant Islamists, writes TASS.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of a single day of voting on the elections of deputies of parliament and the head of state from 24 December to at least February 2022.
"There are less than two weeks left before the elections, and the chances that they will be held on time are rapidly decreasing," the report said.
Against this background, the Libyan High Electoral Commission has postponed the announcement of the final list of candidates for an indefinite period, reports Sky News Arabia.
Foreign Policy in the Eyes of Russians
38% of Russians see more success than failure in the country’s foreign policy, 29% believe that failure predominates.
"Examples of success - "in Syria defended, restored the peace there", "the decision on the Nord Stream-2", "the whole world was intimidated by that cool weaponry", "Crimea we pushed away".
The main failures - "conflict with Ukraine", "confrontation with Western countries", "isolation from the world", - says in a study of the Foundation "Public opinion".
The government of Dubai has completely abandoned the paper business - all public services have also become digital only
The Dubai government has announced the complete abandonment of paperwork and the transition to digital technologies.
All public services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This is reported by the Emirates news agency WAM.
"Today marked the beginning of a new phase of digitizing all aspects of Dubai's life - we have completed the transition to a completely paperless government," Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the Crown Prince of the Emirate, said on Saturday.
Now the internal and external document circulation in all the public institutions of Dubai will be carried out only in digital form through special information platforms.
The innovation has affected everything without exception in the industry: health care, housing, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc. Many commercial structures have also joined the government's initiative.
The transition to e-government and digitalization of document circulation began in Dubai in 2018.
During this time, according to the authorities, 336 million sheets of paper were saved, which is 14 million hours of human labor and 353.8 million dollars in cash equivalent.
Earlier, the mayor of Moscow, Sergey Sobyanin, said that electronic services save citizens 2 days a year.

Turkey's Car Production and Exports Fall Below 2020 Level
Turkey’s car production and exports fell sharply in November amid a depreciation of the lira.
As a result, the industry’s 11-month performance was worse than last year’s, Bloomberg reported, citing data from Turkey’s Automobile Manufacturers Association.
According to the association, in November, 115,000 cars were released from factories in Turkey, which is 20% less than a year earlier.
About 75.9 thousand cars were sent for export, which is more than 25% lower than last year's figure.
And if, according to the results of the first 10 months of this year, the automotive sector of Turkey showed a positive dynamics to the previous year, then at the results of 11 months of 2021, the production of cars was already 0.3% worse than last year.
The reason for this decline was a sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which in November fell by 29% against the dollar.
This has led to a decline in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 SME entities received a deferral on credit payments in 2021
First Deputy Prime Minister Alikhan Smailov spoke about the situation of granting benefits for small and medium-sized businesses, reports the correspondent of MIA "Kazinform".
"According to the information of the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan on regulation and development of the financial market, this year, pursuant to the instructions of the Head of State of April 1, 2021, the order of the Chairman of the Agency of April 9, 2021, No. 127 "About approval of the order of granting of deferred payments on loans of small and medium enterprises"
He recalled that the procedure for granting deferrals of payments on loans provided for the granting of deferrals of payments on loans issued to SMEs, including IP, by banks and organizations carrying out microfinance activities until April 1, 2021, in the period from April 1, 2021 to June 30, 2021.
The deferral period was from 30 to 90 days at the choice of the SME entity.
The borrower's application could indicate a different period of deferral of payments.
During the period of delay for the borrower, the claim work, notification of the need to repay the overdue debt, as well as the creditor's collection of commissions and other payments, were suspended," the deputy prime minister said.
For 2021, banks of the second level received applications for deferral of payments for loans of 603 borrowers-subjects of SMEs, of which 553 subjects of SMEs received deferral in the amount of 9.7 billion tenge.
In the IMF submitted applications for a postponement of 131 SMEs, of which a postponement was granted to 95 entities in the amount of 105.8 million tenge", - concluded A. Smailov.
Pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with weak immunity are able to easily tolerate the strain of "okmyron"
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can tolerate it more easily than those with a strong protective response of the body.
Pulmonologist Sergei Puryasev explained why the strain of coronavirus "okmyron" can be dangerous.
The reason should be sought in the conditions of the origin of the virus.
Scientists believe that "okmyron" originated in the body of HIV-infected or immunodeficient.
That is, during the mutation, he encountered no resistance from immunity.
This makes it more aggressive.
Due to the fact that there was no response from immunity, he became very fast.
Apparently, there he has these spike-proteins, spikes, may be more than laid, their antibodies were not cut during mutations, - comments pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can tolerate "okmyron" more easily than those who have a strong protective reaction of the body.
It turns out that a strong response of the body to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
This is what happens with pneumococcal infections, when a 30-year-old dies, and the 60-year-olds in the form of a sneeze tolerate it.
The immune response is angry at the young man, it is completely inadequate: where it was possible only to threaten with a finger, he beats like a cannon on a spear, - concluded Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor also recalled that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Inflammation of the lungs is bacterial and viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case it is often possible to stop only the symptoms - all hope for the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the onset of intoxication of the body - this is temperature, weakness, malaise.
Then there are respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, sore throat, cough.
Pain to the right or left, abdominal pain can also indicate a developing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia before the end of the year can begin to vaccinate the younger generation from 12 to 18 years.
Virologist, head of the genomics engineering laboratory of the IFTI Pavel Wolchkov noted that this category is very actively suffering from covid.
Teenagers who go to school have as many contacts as possible.
This is the most socially active stratum, as are the children of kindergartens, - said "Moscow 24" Pavel Wolchkov, virologist, head of the laboratory of genomic engineering of the IFTI.

Immunologists Have Hypothesized Why People With Obesity Become Victims of Covid
The authors studied the remaining fat tissue from bariatric surgeries and found that fat cells known as adipocytes could become infected with the coronavirus.
Immune cells located in adipose tissue, macrophages, also became infected, and showed a strong inflammatory reaction.
Scientists also examined the adipose tissue of patients who died from covid and found coronavirus particles in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can hide in adipose tissue, using it as a reservoir, in attempts to avoid the immune system’s response.
SARS-CoV-2 is also capable of this.
Biologist explains the causes of dementia
Biological science candidate Semen Goloshekin mentioned the causes of dementia and told about ways to prevent it in an interview with Sputnik radio.
According to WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome is manifested by a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person can hardly navigate even in a familiar environment.
Goloshekin noted that dementia is most often caused by neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, and a lack of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
These include hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression, and alcoholism.
At the behavioral level, the role of factors such as social isolation and the lack of active cognitive activity is possible," he said.
The development of dementia is also affected by harmful habits - smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorders and a sluggish lifestyle.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
“There is a discussion that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer’s disease and one of the risk factors for it,” he added.
To prevent the onset of the disease, WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of physical load, training cognitive skills and abilities that require the involvement of memory and logic.

Egypt has returned about 30,000 illegally exported artefacts
Over the past 10 years, the government of Cairo has managed to return to its homeland about 30,000 artifacts that were illegally smuggled out of the country.
This was reported on Saturday, December 11, on the Al-Hayat TV channel, the chief inspector of the Department of returned antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt Shaaban Abdel Gaud.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has managed to return 29,300 artifacts.
This year alone, 5,300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered at the Bible Museum in Washington, D.C.,” he said.
Abdel Gaud said that all the artifacts smuggled out were registered in the archives.
The staff of the department are currently working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, the experts "track auctions around the world and sales on the Internet" through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks.
The chief inspector said that upon return, cultural values are restored and then exhibited in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts was the ancient skeleton of a man discovered in Belgium, which is now part of the exposition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, Egyptian authorities asked Interpol to help find the bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun sold at auction in London.
Christie’s auction house held auctions on July 4, on which a bust over 3,000 years old was sold for $5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused dissatisfaction on the part of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the art object was illegally removed from the Karnak Temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted in the image of the sun god Amun, was kept in a private collection and has not been put up for auction since 1985.
How the relic came to Europe is unknown.
In recent years, Egypt has been actively seeking to repatriate illegally removed from the country at different times of antiquity.
According to the authorities, 95% of smuggling antiquities is the result of archaeological searches of "black excavators".
"The Crimean Tatars are not taken into account" - and this is correct, since the Crimean Tatars (232,000) are an independent people (close to the Turks).
If you want to add, only 42,000 people - so many Tatars (Kazakhs) live in Crimea (see census).
The Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
They are united only by the Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to employees’ personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse requires its employees to give the bank access to their personal mobile devices, according to the Financial Times.
The fact is that in Europe and the US, the Swiss bank does not issue its employees corporate communication devices, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
Under the current rules, the bank can view information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as these are used to resolve business issues with colleagues or customers.
The bank has the right to verify mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if the employee used it to hold a meeting with a customer that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now that many employees have switched to remote mode, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that have been used to solve work issues.
According to the newspaper, the management of the bank has set a deadline by which employees can familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Credit Suisse has not officially commented on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Yesenin's life - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but the most difficult for the earthly existence of the poet and his "ego".
He is already out of any literary associations, floated with imaginism, he is himself, but famous, demanded, sometimes strongly slandered by critics, even maliciously, but the reading public is ready to wear it on their hands.
Over the year, more than 60 poems have been written, many of them are true masterpieces, the cycle of "Persian motifs" has been completed, a poem "Anna Snegina" has been written, 8 books have been published, a collection of "Soviet Russia".
And the main success - at the end of June 25, Gosizdat concluded a contract with Yesenin for the publication of his works in 3 volumes.
None of the modern poets, Sergei Alexandrovich, was given this honor, he is the first!
In addition, it was very good money - according to the contract the fee was 1000 rubles per month for 20 months (the plant director, for example, received 300 rubles. per month, the engineer - 200).
The money was needed that year more than ever.
Yesenin married the granddaughter of Leo Tolstoy, Sofia Tolstoy, it was necessary to arrange family life, to keep the sisters Katya and Sasha, as well as the mother.
Life seems to have settled, there is something to rejoice, but for him everything is painted mainly in dark tones, as if a nightmare materialized from the poem "The Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after the death of Yesenin):
My friend, my friend,
I'm very, very sick.
I don’t know where this pain came from.
Does the wind blow?
Over the empty and uninhabited land,
Like the rainbow in September,
Drinking alcohol to the brain.
Many acquaintances have noted that Yesenin gave up strongly, looks bad, is clearly ill.
More and more often recurrence of seizures, nervous breakdowns.
And the reason probably not only in alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - Sergei Alexandrovich someone was put, there are no reliable documents.
Say, relating to May 1923, when Yesenin at the insistence of the fourth wife, American Isadora Duncan corrected the health in the clinic near Paris by Professor Peter Gannushkin (again to him Yesenin two years later, already in Moscow).
But the evidence of the poet's insanity, the scandals on this ground, the motives for the police are enough - scattered over dozens of memoirs.
Since the early 1920s, the poet’s frightening romance with the green snake has developed rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Yesenin briefly settled with his friend, the imaginist Ivan Startsev.
Surprisingly, with his very good income, Yesenin never had his own accommodation either in Moscow or in Peter, he was found in removable apartments, in hotels or with acquaintances.
The old man recalls:
“I only came to sleep, and in most cases in an incomprehensible, drunken state.
One day, returning at four o'clock in the morning, Yesenin fell on the staircase...
Falling, he rubbed his face and sneezed.
Having come a little to himself, he began to cough continuously, splashing the whole sheet with blood..."
Yes, and Yesenin himself after traveling through Europe and the United States (there was a dry law in the States then, but Duncan took with him a decent supply of alcohol) admitted:
"I didn't see anything there except the cabbages and the streets...
I'm done, and I've stopped remembering people.
Well, and drinking, of course...
And I drank because I was thirsty.”

Polish Foreign Ministry Says Belarus Uses Migrants as ‘Weapon’ Against EU
Polish Foreign Ministry Says Belarus Uses Migrants as ‘Weapon’
Poland’s Deputy Foreign Minister Pavel Yablo<0xC5><0x84>ski said Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko used refugees as a “weapon” against the European Union and intends to return to such an “operation” next year.
The Deputy Foreign Minister made the corresponding statement in an interview with the Australian Financial Review newspaper.
According to Yablonsky, sanctions against Belarus temporarily “stopped Lukashenko”, but he “is actively looking for new ways”.
Also, the Polish official is confident that now illegal migrants will be used as weapons "in many parts of the world".
According to the website kp.ru, the European Union previously implemented the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
It affected 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they said they were ready to extend the restrictive measures against the republic further, "unless the situation in the country improves".
In response, Minsk imposed a food embargo on a wide list of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not for a hat": when a velvet jacket makes a man laugh
The world events of 2021 were dominated by velvet jackets.
Perhaps the first to say about his new fashion solution was Daniel Craig.
Back in September at the premiere of the film "No time to die" he appeared in a velvety raspberry jacket and a traditional "bondage" butterfly.
He was followed twice by Prince William, who first wore a green velvet jacket incompatible with the royal dress code at the The Earthshot Prize eco-award ceremony, and then chose a more classic option for the event in support of the Royal Variety charity fund.
A couple of weeks ago, the trend was tested by Lionel Messiai.
The footballer came to pick up the seventh "Golden Ball" in the velvet jacket Dolce & Gabbana.
By the way, his sons were dressed in the same.
AliExpress already notes the growing demand for velvet men’s jackets in Russia.
According to analysts of the service, which came to Gazeta.Ru, they began to buy 1.4 times more often.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with lining and silhouette, the main colors are dark beige, burgundy, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models - from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy exclusively jackets - sets of velvet suits they choose less often.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
Budget options are available at H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the luxury velvet jackets segment this season are presented in almost all brands - and Brioni, and Paul Smith, and Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most desirable is the Gucci model, in which one of the premieres of the film "House of Gucci" brand ambassador Jared Leto.
Choosing jackets of expensive brands, you can be sure that the velvet is made of silk.
Thanks to the special technology of weaving the threads, a dense fabric with a curly outer texture and a smooth inner side is obtained.
More budget options are made of cotton or polyamide, but also, respectively, serve less.
Fashion expert Lamoda Ilya Vakhoshin, warns that in the case of a velvet jacket, the main thing is not its model or style, but its relevance.
"The barhat requires evening light, so such a jacket is ideal if you are gathered for a party or a festive event," Vakhoshin explains. - It is also suitable for those cases where the dress code "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie" is indicated in the invitation.
Another important criterion, the compliance of which allows to make a choice in favor of a velvet jacket, is the status of its buyer.
"A man in a velvet jacket, first of all, should get the right advanced party with plenty, - the authors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion "Beautiful Brammel." - The owners of velvet jackets, as a rule, belong to the caste of those people who rarely buy.
They are simply invited to timed secular events, where the dress code is always indicated.
Ilya Vakhoshin offers to combine a jacket made of velvet with the same decorative things: classic pants with arrows, monochrome shirts, silk tie, lobsters with brushes, cufflinks.
Too simple and everyday things will look inappropriate.
Fashion experts from "Beautiful Brammel" are sure: it will be inappropriate to appear in a velvet jacket of a regular employee at the company, but if it is about "the leader among those who manage this event, then - "yes", to him such a thing in the subject. "
If the employee ranks lower, and his goal is to move higher in the company’s complex hierarchy or knock out financial bonuses, it is better not to wear a velvet jacket.
The guide will appreciate this with the phrase "not a shadow hat", - the editors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion.
Very ambiguous sensations from the voice.
It's an unnatural timbre, it's so annoying.
And it is not at all associated with the cute face of a young girl.
Honestly, I don't understand the admiration of others.
But with all my heart I wish you luck in life!
It’s all about money – alternative energy is well-lobbyed, that is, paid for.
billions of investments.
Are they sad?
No, the price of electricity has gone up.
Traditional energy is also not in stock – both gas, oil and coal were bought cheaper than they are now selling.
There is a wild demand for fuel.
The cop is dripping.
Who's in the air then?
As usual, an ordinary buyer.
Are the problems of the Indians touching the sheriff?
Therefore, Western politicians should not be considered idiots, "missing" the energy crisis.
They did their job.
For a good salary.
I didn’t see any beautiful people in the photos.
Just mediocrity within the framework of average passengers.
It is possible that if such characters are so confident in their beauty that they decide to show it to the whole car, then they are unlikely to fit into such.
But only because of the mental disorder and ignorance of such "beautiful (-its)", but certainly not because of their appearance.
“A slave who is aware of his slave status and who fights against it is a revolutionary.
A slave who is not conscious of his slavery and who is lurking in a silent, unconscious and speechless slave life is simply a slave.
A slave whose saliva flows when he self-satisfiedly describes the delights of a slave life and is delighted with a kind and good master, is a holop, hah.
Immunologist said that revaccination in 4-5 months will help protect against the strain of the coronavirus "omicron"
Revaccination after four to five months can protect against a new strain of coronavirus infection "micron".
This statement was made by immunologist Nikolai Kryuchkov, who called the vaccination six months later, taking into account the appearance of a new strain, "a very long period"
"In previous strains, this period was normal, but now it is best to carry out the procedure in five months, and people with chronic diseases - in four," - said the expert, calling in parallel with the vaccination campaign, to undertake revaccination.
Kryuchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
“If a person has been given two vaccinations and a booster, or he has become sick and vaccinated, or has been vaccinated and has become sick, then he has received ‘hybrid immunity’, that is, antibodies that are many and neutralizing enough,” the expert said.
The “Big Seven” warned Russia of “scaling consequences” in case of invasion of Ukraine
The “Big Seven” countries (UK, Germany, Italy, Canada, USA, France and Japan) published a statement following the meeting of foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It emphasizes that Russia’s “military aggression” against Ukraine “will have huge consequences and will cost Moscow a lot,” but the specific measures are not described in the document.
"We, the Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of the buildup of Russian military power and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine," the statement said.
Further, the ministers call on Russia to “weaken the escalation, use diplomatic channels and comply with its international obligations regarding transparency of military activity,” which US President Biden spoke about during a video call to Russian President Putin on December 7.
"We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk agreements with a view to resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine," the G7 foreign ministers said.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have enormous consequences and a serious price in response,” they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its future.
We welcome Ukraine’s restrained stance.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response," the statement said.
Earlier in the day, the head of British diplomacy Elizabeth Trass said that Russia would be subject to "serious consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
According to her, this meeting showed the “single voice of the countries of the “Big Seven”, which account for 50% of the world’s GDP, and which made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine will have huge consequences for Russia.”
The Pfizer vaccine was found to be 32 times less effective than the omicron strain
The efficacy of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech against the micron strain of coronavirus is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
Scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong have come to this conclusion, reports the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was found to be less effective based on a study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of the drug from COVID-19.
"We see that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the original Sars-CoV-2 variant, but this ability was significantly reduced against the micron variety," said Professor Malik Pairis.
At the same time, the scientists emphasized that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against the severe course of the disease when infected with the coronavirus.
Previously, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic taking into account the influence of the omicron strain on it.
The authors of the study concluded that the omicrone strain could cause a new wave of virus circulation and an increase in mortality if no additional measures are taken.
The Head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine accused Germany of blocking the supply of NATO weapons to Kiev
The head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Alexei Reznikov accused the government of the former Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel of blocking the purchase of deadly weapons by Kiev within the framework of NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany vetoed the purchase by Ukraine of anti-sniper systems and rifles for the defeat of drones.
At the same time, it is noted that Berlin later softened its position on the rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the defense minister, Kiev intends to seek the acquisition of the above-mentioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with the allies.
In particular, we are talking about the United States, the United Kingdom, Lithuania and France.
Meanwhile, FT notes that the position of the new German government led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz on allowing arms supplies to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, the Ambassador of Ukraine to Germany Andrei Melnik expressed the opinion that Kiev should not expect arms supplies from Berlin under Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous leadership of Germany explained its refusal to provide weapons at the risk of the military escalation of the conflict in the Donbas, despite the "occupation by Russia" of part of the Ukrainian territory.
The same "illogical" position, the diplomat is sure, Germany will maintain with the new chancellor.
In August, the Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky said that Kiev expects help from Berlin in equipping the navy.
In Ukraine, they expect that Germany "will be a partner of Ukraine in a technical sense," the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chairman of the "green" party of Germany, Robert Habeck, visited the republic, where he advocated the sale of defensive weapons to Kiev.

Mercedes filed a protest against the result of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix
The German Mercedes team, whose driver Lewis Hamilton finished second in a row at the Abud-Dabi Grand Prix, after Red Bull driver Max Ferstappen, protested the final result of the race, the Formula 1 press service reports.

G7 warns Russia of responsibility for invasion of Ukraine
The G7 foreign ministers warned of "serious consequences" for Russia if it continues its military aggression against Ukraine, the parties said in a final statement.
The participants of the meeting also noted that they condemn the strengthening of the Russian armed forces at the borders of the country.
“Russia should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have serious consequences and serious costs,” the statement, published on the UK government’s website, said.
The G7 ministers and the EU’s High Representative said they were “alone in their condemnation of Russia’s armed reinforcement and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine.”
British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Trass at a press conference in Liverpool warned of "great consequences" for Russia in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
We have made it clear that any invasion will have significant consequences...
The G7 wants Russia to renounce its aggression towards Ukraine,” she said.
Earlier at the summit in Liverpool, G7 foreign ministers agreed that to resolve the crisis due to the build-up of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine, the parties must return to the negotiating table.
We were talking about negotiations in the Normandy format.
The North Atlantic Alliance also advocated dialogue on Ukraine in the Normandy format.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that by calling on Russia and Ukraine to return to the negotiating table, the G7 countries “resigned in their failure to take responsibility for their own mistakes.”

Revealed ways to return stolen money through online stores
There are several ways to recover money stolen through online stores and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
They were revealed by information security experts in an interview with the RBC.
Thus, to reduce the risk of major losses when getting bank card data into the hands of attackers, it is recommended to keep basic funds on the card or bank account that are not used in online shopping.
Part of the savings can be deposited into a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend to buy a separate card for online shopping.
If the money was stolen when shopping in stores that do not use 3D Secure security technology, you can start the refund procedure.
“Under the rules established by payment systems, for unauthorized transactions carried out without the use of 3D Secure, the responsibility lies with the participant in the chain of settlements who does not use this service,” the representative of Promsvyazbank said.
Expert from the international payment provider Ecommpay Arthur Zaremba stressed that the buyer has the right to apply to the bank to challenge the fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the criminal has used the card on online resources that do not require two-factor authorization, the transaction can be challenged and refunded.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores themselves return funds to the customer, if the order has not yet been sent for delivery.
On November 19, a member of the Public Chamber, director of the League of Safe Internet, Ekaterina Mizulina, said that in 2021 alone, 11,000 requests were received for various cases of fraud: from the sale of fake documents to the theft of personal data.
According to her, an effective solution under the current circumstances could be to create a single window for complaints about online fraudsters.
Scholz arrives in Poland to discuss Nord Stream 2 and EU legislation
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw for talks on the migrant crisis on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the build-up of Russian troops on the borders of Ukraine and the situation with the Russian Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
Although Scholz expressed his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries expressed unequivocal expectations from each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said he would call on Scholz to oppose Nord Stream 2, which is supposed to deliver Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
According to Moravetsky, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland’s efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin said it would help Warsaw and Brussels to resolve the crisis.
Poland’s judicial system, however, remains one of the reasons for disagreement.
The European Court of Justice fined Poland, finding that the judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing Law and Justice party violated EU law.
Poland has refused to pay the fine, and its highest court has ruled that national legislation takes precedence over EU rules.
Germany’s new government, sworn in on Wednesday, despite the demands of Poland and the United States, has not made public commitments to stop the Nord Stream 2 operation in the event of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
U.S. officials told members of Congress that they had reached an agreement with Germany to stop the gas pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, a senior U.S. congressional official said on Tuesday.
German officials did not confirm these reports, but Scholz warned on Wednesday of the consequences if Russia violates Ukraine's border, and the position was confirmed by the representatives of the "Big Seven" on Sunday.

The money found in the wall of the church plumbing will be paid 20,000 dollars
A plumber who found money in a church wall in the U.S. state of Texas will be rewarded.
This is reported in the press release of the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident took place in a large evangelical church in Lakewood, where pastor Joel Austen preaches, promising that devout Christians are waiting for wealth and prosperity.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cole repaired one of the church toilets and found under heat insulation thousands of bags of money and checks.
He passed on the find of the church and, according to him, did not receive even thanks from Austin.
“I wanted to hear him say, ‘You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you did and what you could have done,” KPRC-TV quoted him as saying.
The discovery is believed to have been linked to a theft that occurred in the Church of Lakewood seven years ago.
Then about $200,000 in cash and $400,000 in checks that were stored in the church safe was lost.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer any losses.
However, for information about the criminals announced the award, amounting to $25,000.
Justin Cole could not claim this amount, as the term of the award has already expired.
Despite this, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, which at one time awarded $5,000 and later received another $20,000 from the Church of Lakewood, decided to reward the honesty of the plumber.
He'll get $20,000.
Earlier it was reported that the police interrogated pastor Joel Austin about the money found in the wall of the Church of Lakewood.
Tanya, her statements, her actions - this is her characteristic "as a real person".
That’s why her attitude is so negative.
And it’s not that “she’s financially significantly richer than all the pens,” as they write here.

In Brazil, citizens were required to present vaccination passports when entering the country
In Brazil, they were obliged to demand a covid passport from those entering the territory of the state, the corresponding decision was made by the judge of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF) Luis Roberto Barroso.
This is reported by CNN Brasil.
Citizens who have contraindications to vaccination are exempt from the presentation of a certificate of vaccination.
Also included in the list of exceptions are persons who have arrived from countries where the absence of the vaccine has been proven.
"The situation is even more serious, given that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's Eve, pre-carnival and carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in the flow of tourists," Barroso said.
Previously, the Brazilian authorities had obliged unvaccinated tourists to observe a five-day quarantine.
A complete scheme of protection against COVID-19 has been revealed
A virologist, doctor of medical sciences, a well-deserved Russian scientist, Anatoly Altstein, in a conversation with Ura.ru, revealed a scheme of complete protection against coronavirus infection.
According to him, this can be achieved by injecting and using a nasal vaccine.
With international use, a large amount of immunoglobulin A is formed. When the vaccine is administered by injection, this does not happen.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot penetrate the body.
And inside, after vaccination, we have the most immunoglobulins G (antibodies).
And if you introduce both vaccines, you will get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there is still no solution for double vaccination," the doctor said.
The main prophylaxis of UrFO, doctor of medical sciences Sergey Tokarev, in turn, said that the main advantage of using nasal vaccination together with injection is the ability to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this will help that in this case, the protection of the body should supposedly become the maximum.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of the Nizhny Novgorod region David Melik-Huseynov said that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic will lead to the spread of a new coronavirus infection among children.
According to him, it is this picture that is observed in other countries, where the next wave of the pandemic came earlier.
Inna, um...
I talked to the donkey (died a long time ago) like this - if you are ready to change the warm house, the pet, the affection, the love and the games to the liquid bitch, then go ahead.
But the dog was trained and smart at all.
He chose my company and went home.
A video method that works in 90% of cases.
Not from the ceiling, believe me.
I prevented many of the owners from running after the dog, although they believed that there were 200,000 running away (spoilers), took a straight hand and led them to the other side.
In the end, "200,000" chose the owner, not the dog that ran somewhere there.
In Europe, mass protests of anti-vaccination activists do not stop
In the Austrian capital Vienna, more than 40,000 demonstrators took to the streets.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and plans of the authorities to make vaccination against covid mandatory.
From February next year, unvaccinated people will have to pay a fine of 3,600 euros.
The Spaniards, outraged by the health policy of the authorities, held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held in their hands posters that said, "This is a fake pandemic," "I'm not going to get vaccinated."
A major protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, the covid certificate is mandatory for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and night entertainment establishments.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports in several regions of the country was taken against the background of an increase in the number of cases of coronavirus infection.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand demonstrators protested against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action began peacefully, but then grew into clashes with the guards of order.
A group of demonstrators began throwing stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officers used water cannons.
Nikolai S., even in Wikipedia there is no consensus on this.
Kashevarova-Rudneva is also referred to as "the first Russian doctor, doctor of medicine", probably because she began to study earlier.
Let’s just not argue, I think they both deserve this title.
There is only one thing I agree with Zakharova: the Americans carried only death and plunder to any country, wherever they appeared.

WHO has detected the “micron” in six dozen countries
The World Health Organization (WHO) said a new strain of coronavirus “micron” has already been detected in 63 countries.
A number of experts have already said that the spread of the new strain can have catastrophic consequences.
The rate of distribution of the strain was reported in a WHO report.
According to the organization, as of December 9, the strain has already been identified in 63 countries, in all six regions of the WHO.
This is despite the fact that it began to spread actively only since the end of November.
WHO is also concerned about the high rate of spread of the new variant of the coronavirus.
WHO experts express concern that the new strain according to preliminary data could bypass the extent of the spread of the "delta" strains, it is the Indian version of the coronavirus, which now leads in all countries without exception.
Earlier, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the omicron strain could have a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions have also been drawn in the UK.
Experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that the “micron” will push the “delta” in the coming months.
And the number of patients in the UK alone will be about 1 million. This is despite the fact that officially "micron" at the moment in the Kingdom sick several hundred people, and according to estimates up to 10,000.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the strain "micron", and at the peak, more than 2,000 people will be taken to hospitals every day.
What the British health care system will not be able to cope with.
The situation is complicated by the fact that according to the latest studies, the effectiveness of the vaccine from the company Pfizer-BioNTech against the strain "micron" is 32 times lower compared to the other types of the disease.
How the Russian “Satellite V” reacts to the “micron” is not yet known – this will become clear in the next few weeks.
The center named after Gamalei has just started testing the Russian vaccine on the strain "omicron".
Why do we need to see the stages of aging?

Soviet times are called “the time of the devils.”
At that time, people believed in God much more honestly than they do today.
And they were raised practically according to the laws of God (love of neighbor, do not steal, etc.).
What an ideology today is money at all costs.
Boltons like the Globe of Faith are few (yes it is not at all), but even if so, the time of the devils came in the 90s...
Our St. Petersburg, or rather Leningrad Communal with the Great Green still maintains communication.
Of course, we are not the closest friends, but we try to preserve the warmth of the relationship of the older generation.
Perhaps this is due to the fact that there were no guests in the apartment, the rooms were not given up, and no one canceled the blockade fraternity.
We are seeing each other more and more at funerals.

Russians warned about a new scheme of fraudsters
The attackers began to look for new maneuvers for fraud in video messages.
This is reported by Izvestia, citing experts.
According to Ivideon’s product director, Zaura Abutalimova, the main danger associated with the distribution of video communications is dipsticks.
In this case, the scammers create a fake video based on real recordings involving the victim.
Thanks to this neural network, it is possible to accurately reproduce the features of a person's behavior.
Abutalimov added that using a dipfake, the attackers could call a friend of the victim on video or create a video with a copy of the person for the purpose of blackmail.
“Such fakes can easily provoke bullying, as a cunning attacker can put people in ridiculous, dangerous or compromising pseudo-scenarios,” the expert said.
Leading system engineer Varonis Alexander Vetkol, in turn, noted that psychologically, people trust others more when they see them.
He stressed that this could create specific risks when it comes to video-based technologies.
David, I'll add.
In what I wrote above, I emphasized that I bought it all in a small town where the local mentality did not allow much to paint and walk in short skirts, show stockings and pantyhose on my legs.
This is a province, but there was such a product in the store.
In large cities and Muslim women were painted, and beds were shown.
So in Dushanbe, it is a big city, the capital of the republic.
There are a lot of fashionistas, but there are no cosmetics.
Here are five things that can help prevent diabetes mellitus.
Blood sugar problems are one of the most common in the world.
However, some do not attach much importance to it, and in vain.
Diabetes mellitus can eventually lead to serious complications and even death.
Preventive measures play a major role in preventing the formation of diseases.
Thus, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - a decrease in the number of various drinks and the transition to plain water positively affect metabolism.
Sweet foods raise blood sugar levels to a dangerous indicator when consumed in excess quantities.
Therefore, the first step towards a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and store them at home.
The onset of the disease is affected not only by improper nutrition, but also by habits.
To reduce the risks of diabetes, you need to move a lot.
Experts advise to adhere to a low-carb diet.
Such a diet will not only help to reduce weight, but also protect against sharp fluctuations in sugar levels.
To protect against diabetes, it is necessary to eat a lot of fiber.
Food fibers fill the stomach and thus contribute to the emergence of a feeling of satiety, the secretion of digestive juices and the increase in the absorption of food.

Dr. Pavlova told about the "migraine of the weekend" in the workaholics
Deterioration of well-being on the weekend can lead to several factors
The reason for the deterioration of health after working weekdays is often "the migraine of the weekend", said a well-known doctor-endocrinologist, a doctor of medical sciences, a senior researcher of the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine of the MSU, the scientific director of the Clinic of Systemic Medicine of Zukhra Pavlova in his telegram.
According to her, especially often workaholics suffer from this, who on weekends have headaches, brokenness and weakness.
Dr. Pavlova noted that in addition to the accumulated fatigue for a week there are many objective reasons for the negative reaction of the body to change conditions.
Over the weekend, our lives are changing radically.
“We sleep for a long time, we lie on the sofa all day, we probably eat more and drink less,” the doctor argued.
Because of overeating and lack of water - heaviness and breakdown."
An additional role is played by the late rise.
So, if you get up three hours later than usual, there will be a reaction called jetlag.
It occurs in travelers who cross several time zones.
In order to determine which of the factors plays a decisive role in the deterioration of well-being, Pavlova recommended to monitor what changes most strongly on the weekends.

South African scientists say low efficacy of Pfizer vaccine against "micron"
In South Africa, said the low effectiveness of the vaccine Pfizer against "micron"
Scientists from the South African Republic conducted a study and reported the low efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against the micron-strain of coronavirus infection.
According to estimates, it (the level of neutralization of the "micron") corresponds to (the level) of effectiveness of the vaccine at 22.5% against infection with symptoms, due to which... the ability of the vaccine to protect against infection is questioned, - said in the text of the study, published on the portal MedRxiv.
At the same time, experts clarified that the drug can save from the severe course of the disease.
Previously, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that an omicron strain of the coronavirus could trigger a new wave of pandemics in the UK with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much sugar is hidden in common foods?
Sugar is not the best source of nutrients.
Its excess in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cause cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should take into account that under an unfamiliar word in the composition of the product can be indicated hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to sugar in calorie, composition and glycemic index.
Several dozen names can be represented on the label, essentially denoting sugar.
One of the most common and common names is glucose and fructose.
There may also be other canned sugars, such as dextrose (sugar derived from corn), levulose (fruit sugar), molasses (black duck), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that belong to mono- and disaccharides, and they can be not only in confectionery, but also in ketchup, in doctor's sausage, bread, etc.
As stated in Roskachest, the most effective way to reduce the consumption of sugar is to consume whole and unprocessed products, as well as pay attention to the label and many different names of sugar.
Different types of sugar differ in taste, but no matter what the ingredient in the product is called - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it still remains sugar.
Calculating the exact amount of sugar is not easy, as it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the packaging, but also that vegetables, fruits, etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar may be significantly higher than indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: Gas will lose importance for Germany in 25 years
The new Chancellor of Germany Olaf Scholz said that gas imports are losing importance for Germany as the country continues the transition to decarbonization of the economy.
According to him, Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal by 2045, becoming a climate neutral country.
"That is, in 25 years the world will be such that the question of transporting gas to Germany and Europe will play a different role," the chancellor said.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to remain committed to ensuring that Ukraine transports Russian natural gas in the future, as at the moment this resource is important for the energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States made a statement that recorded support from Berlin for Ukraine’s energy transformation.
Earlier, German Foreign Minister Annalena Berbock said that the process of certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline is ongoing.
According to the Minister, in the framework of the coalition negotiations and the discussion of the coalition agreement, it was stated that the European law in the field of energy should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also indicated that the pipeline “does not yet comply with the requirements” of the European Union.

Hackers hack into India's Prime Minister's Twitter
Hackers have hacked the Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The attackers managed to publish a fake message.
It was reported that India allegedly recognized bitcoin as a legal tender, and that the country has already purchased the cryptocurrency.
Modi's office was asked to ignore the new messages.
Representatives of the Prime Minister said that Twitter reacted quickly - access to the account was restored.
The Prime Minister of India’s website was hacked in 2020 and called for donations to the fund with the help of cryptocurrency.
In a referendum in New Caledonia, a majority voted against independence
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on 12 December, ended with the same result as the two previous ones.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, December 12, at noon, a majority of the inhabitants of New Caledonia voted during the referendum against the independence of their territory.
At the same time, the level of participation in this third vote has been significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, New Caledonia's independence from France was supported by 3.51% (2,755 people) of voters, while 96.49% (75,762) voted against.
The turnout was 43.90%, with more than 80,000 residents of New Caledonia taking part in the elections.
According to France-Presse, “the outcome of these elections left no room for doubt” as supporters of independence urged voters not to participate in the vote.
As the initiators of the referendum, they opposed it on 12 December, believing that a new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the archipelago prevents a full and "honest" election campaign.
Thus, this non-participation paved the way for the French New Caledonia’s third victory, following the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of the population voted against independence, in 2020 - 53.3%.
As the separatists have said, they do not recognize the results of the last vote and will challenge them in the UN.
As reported on Sunday, December 12, at the Elysee Palace, French President Emmanuel Macron is due to deliver the results of this referendum.
The issue of New Caledonia’s independence has largely revived the last weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several presidential candidates have spoken out in favor of the territory remaining part of France, as it is "the last region of the European Union's presence in the Pacific".
“New Caledonia must definitely remain French,” Eric Zemmur said repeatedly.
The same statement was made by Republican candidate Valerie Pecress, who in late October published a column in Le Figaro, urging the Caledonian people to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position, "because it is not his responsibility".
However, the president added: “France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia.”
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed "a strong desire for the choice of the Caledonian people to be the choice of France".

In Turkey tested the world's first drone with laser weapons
Turkey has successfully tested the world’s first laser-armed drone.
UAV "Eren" tested at a distance of 100 to 500 m, reports "MIR24".
The device is able to neutralize explosive objects at a distance with the help of a laser.
The maximum flight height of the novelty reaches 3,000 m.
After passing the relevant tests, the UAV must enter the Turkish military, which will use it to destroy explosive devices without attracting sappers.
Turkey is one of six countries in the world capable of developing and producing its own drones.

WSJ readers criticized the article on relations between Russia and the United States
Readers of The Wall Street Journal have criticized Professor Christopher Hartwell’s article, in which he described his vision of Russia and the United States.
The author of the material expressed concern that the West is allegedly sacrificing Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinces readers of the danger that comes from Moscow, and has made a number of offensive statements against Russian President Vladimir Putin.
In the end, Hartwell called on Western countries to “come on a united front against Russia.”
Readers of the WSJ expressed their disagreement with the position of the American professor.
"In this article there is quite a lot of false information," RIA Novosti commented one of the readers.
“Europe is not ours to ‘lose’ it, and Ukraine is not our land.
“The United States and NATO allies will never enter a nuclear war with Russia for Ukraine,” he said.

An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred in the area of the Kuril Islands
An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred near the Kuril island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was located 231.8 km northeast of the city of Severo-Kurilsk.
The focus was at a depth of 92.5 km.
Earlier, seismologists recorded an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 in Peru, during which ten people were injured.

Ukraine will start to produce jet drones of the new generation
At the new Ukrainian-Turkish plant will begin to create jet drones (UAVs) type ANKA.
This was reported on December 11, by the independent adviser of the head of the office of the Ukrainian President Alexei Arrestovich.
That is, they are able to act against air objects, against other drones.
Even against a manned aircraft.
On them will be Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish avionics: the body and the like," - quotes him Dialog.ua.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA devices, Arrestovich said that these are jets, not piston UAVs.
According to him, this is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which exceed it "in all characteristics".
The first batch of the UAV should be produced by the plant at the end of next year, Arrestovich concluded.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone has been carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
The day before, the Ukrainian General Staff secreted data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems during military operations of the joint forces in the Donbas.
On December 6, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky said that the construction of a plant for the manufacture of modern military drones had begun in the country.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, the company Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense concluded an agreement on the construction in the Kiev region of the center, in which they will conduct training of personnel, as well as testing and maintenance of Turkish Bayraktar UAVs.
The press service of the office of the Ukrainian leader called this memorandum "a big real step forward".
Two lions escaped from the container at the airport.
In Singapore Changi airport, lions escaped.
This is reported by The Straits Times.
The two predators managed to get out of the container with seven lions, who arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore and where they were going.
One of the runaway lions rested on the roof of the container.
The beasts could not get away from it because of the protective net installed next to it.
The confrontation ended after the arrival at the airport of employees of the Mandai Wildlife Group, which runs all Singapore Zoos.
They immobilized the lions with a tranquilizer and plan to deliver them to a quarantine facility.
Earlier it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, the lion fled from the owner and walked through the streets of the city.
On the same day the animal voluntarily returned home, people were not injured.
Experts warn about the threat of cancer due to vitamin B9
Research suggests that an excess of vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was reported by Daily Express.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who are not deficient in folic acid are less at risk of getting some types of cancer, in particular colorectal cancer.
However, overdose on the contrary contributes to the growth of cancer cells.
Professor of the University of Alabama in Birmingham, dietitian Beth Kitchin advises to monitor the amount of folic acid consumed during the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer increases only if you deviate significantly from this figure in a greater or lesser direction.
Kitchin recommends not to take vitamin B9 in tablets without the recommendation of a doctor, be sure to monitor the dosage and avoid flakes with milk and other foods that contain folic acid.
Previously, nutrition consultant Rachel Fine called folic acid a substance that slows down aging.
Because it is contained in avocados, among other things, Fine recommended that men after 50 years eat this fruit more often.
In the UK, by April, about 75,000 people could die from an omicron strain.
Forecasts by British scientists show that up to 75,000 people in England could die from the spread of the coronavirus strain in the next five months if the restrictive measures are not tightened in the winter.
This was reported by The Guardian, citing a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), reports TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast of specialists who are part of the scientific and advisory group on emergencies under the British Cabinet, by April 2022 in the country will record at least 25,000 deaths due to the strain of omicron, and all will be hospitalized about 175,000.
At the peak of the incidence, hospitals will receive more than 2,000 infected daily.
"Serious measures to combat the coronavirus may be needed to prevent the National Health Service from overloading if the omicron strain is more contagious than the delta variant, and current vaccines cannot rule out infection," said LSH mathematician Rosanna.
The U.K.’s Health Safety Agency has said that if the proliferation rate of the strain remains at its current level, around 1 million cases will be detected by the end of the year.
By mid-December, the omicron strain could become the dominant strain in the United Kingdom.
Currently, 1898 cases of coronavirus infection have been detected in the UK, of which 633 have been detected in the last 24 hours.
On December 9, the head of the British Ministry of Health Sajid Javid indicated that in reality this figure can already reach 10,000 cases.

The demand for superyachts has increased by a quarter in the world
Construction of superyachts this year and orders for next year are breaking the world records, despite calls to reduce the hydrocarbon footprint and combat climate change.
In the world register of ships, the number of ordered yachts amounted to 1,200 units - a quarter more than last year.
In the era of tackling the impacts of climate change on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it is hard to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money for a floating fortress for <0xC2><0xA3>50 million and above will not decrease.
However, they are becoming more and more.
This year, 25% more ships were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say there has not been such a buzz in the market for 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht are afraid of infection on land and prefer to escape the pandemic on board their own ship.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
If before all these people went to the office and met with business partners in person, now the absolute majority of them work remotely, and negotiations are carried out on a fool’s errand.
Broker Will Christie told the newspaper that the shipyards accept orders for new yachts for 2025 and later.
This means that customers are willing to pay more if only their yacht was ready at least a year or two earlier.
“People just crave freedom, and the super-rich could afford it,” he says.
In Western society, many criticize this behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, say sociologists, do not want to understand that in times of deprivation of space travel, life on yachts or flights on their own planes are irritating to society because the elite do not want to share responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists are urging governments to take action and suggest introducing new taxes and rules for the super-rich, although they understand that with such money mobility, it will be extremely difficult to implement.
In the meantime, it is impressive only the number of ordered super yachts, but also their characteristics.
Of the 1,200 ships, 27 have a length of feed above 100 meters.
Norwegian billionaire Rekke is building a 183-metre-long REV Ocean.
After landing on the water, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht features a "moon pool" as well as a submarine designed to explore the sea depths.
On the existing super-yachts became the usual platforms for helicopters, open-air cinemas, and on some of them, as, for example, on the yacht of the fighter McGregor - a platform for single-handedness.
But it has symbolic significance when you consider that there are just over 2,000 billionaires in the world.
This is just another example of overconsumption by a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the emission footprint of billionaires is thousands of times greater than that of the average inhabitant of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, the planet’s biggest polluter Roman Abramovich is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases that hit the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two-thirds of the emission trail was hidden on his 162.5-metre-long Eclipse yacht.
Even if the owner is not on board the yacht, the team continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the command to catch the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
Superyacht owners don’t sympathize with other people when they, as Australia’s richest woman, Gina Reinhardt, who owns mines on the continent, complain through YouTube that their giant vessels have no place for docking.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for ships 50 meters long.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol is determined, leading to the development of intestinal cancer
American scientists have determined how much alcohol a week increases the risk of developing cancer.
This is reported by Daily Express.
Experts have concluded that the consumption of four or more servings of alcoholic beverages per week is associated with an increased risk of developing oncology.
At the same time, the likelihood of developing the disease increases with the increase in the amount of alcohol consumed.
Moreover, moderately drunk men have a higher risk of developing intestinal cancer than women.
The exact cause of this type of oncology can not be determined by scientists, noting only that certain factors lead to a process that is harmful to the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many, or rather all, dog lovers are sure that these creatures are very smart.
But even they don’t realize how much the four-legged pets are actually developed.
Over the years, biologists have conducted various experiments to learn for sure how intelligence develops in animals.
Although a dog’s vocabulary is not as extensive as a human one, a new study proves that a dog can consistently respond to 89 words or phrases.
The work of the scientists was published in the journal Sciencealert.
Dogs can’t play chess or compose poems, they don’t make sense in politics, economics, and art, while they often manage to fool their owners.
Representatives of some breeds, experts believe, show better results in understanding the words of the human language, but statistics for accurate conclusions are not yet enough.
So, some breeds are traditionally considered dog geniuses - for example, labradors.
Scientists have concluded that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and the ability to learn is not inferior to a two-year-old child.

Ukraine prepares for trade with the United States and Russia
The United States and Russia will “negotiate” Ukraine’s accession to NATO, analyst Alexander Kochetkov said in his article for the publication “Glavred”.
In his opinion, Washington and Moscow plan to continue negotiations on the United States' guarantees that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of the American leader Joe Biden about the right of countries "to enter anywhere".
If you are offered something knowingly unacceptable, well, for example, to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, you will not negotiate, but simply send the offerer.
And with regard to Ukraine, a trade is planned," the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but seeks dialogue with Kiev.
"Preparation is conducted secretly, quickly and immediately proceed to offensive actions, and do not wait for the group to detect and deploy the opposing forces," he said.
China stimulates the development of the rail transport industry
Advanced Chinese technologies attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the China International Exhibition of Rail Transport and Equipment in 2021, held in Zhuzhou, Hunan Province.
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical faults, said a representative of the company Hou Zhaowen.
The high-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway line, which was put into service earlier this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will provide increased reliability and performance of the rolling stock.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased its rail vehicle exports and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing “Chinese speed.”
In May of this year from the production line of CRRC company Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd came down the first developed in China two-story high-speed electric vehicles intended for export to Europe.
With a maximum working speed of 200 kilometers per hour, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the trial operation of the subway train developed by the aforementioned company for Turkey began.
The train will run along the subway line connecting the center of Istanbul with the city’s airport.
The subway line will open next year.
It will be the fastest metro line in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
“China’s railway equipment manufacturing industry is one of the industries with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovation competitiveness,” said Feng Yaosian, head of the trade and investment department of China’s Committee to Promote International Trade.
“This industry represents the main competitive advantage of China’s production of high-end equipment in the global market,” said Feng Yaosian.
After more than 60 years of hard work, conducting a number of independent research and development, China has created an advanced system of production of equipment for rail transport, with a full range of auxiliary equipment and with large-scale production activities.
According to Feng Yaosian, the country ranks first in terms of the level of electrification of the railways and in terms of the operating mileage on high-speed and urban railways.
Biologist lists early signs of dementia
Biological science candidate Semen Goloshekin in an interview with radio Sputnik listed early signs of dementia.
According to him, signs of future dementia can be forgetfulness, as well as a number of moderate cognitive impairments, such as an inability to concentrate, planning, and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
There is currently a discussion that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer’s disease and one of the risk factors for it, the specialist said.
Goloshekin stressed that the causes of dementia can be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, a lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer’s disease and atherosclerosis of the vessels of the brain are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that to date, doctors do not know effective ways to treat dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in time.
According to him, reducing the risk of developing dementia will help the study of foreign languages and active communication.
WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intensive memory involvement and logic thinking.
"There are recommendations for the use of different baths, but their effectiveness and expediency are still being discussed in the scientific community," Goloshekin said.
“The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities with the help of games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logic of thinking,” Golosekin said.
Earlier, a charity for the study of dementia in the UK said that the disease is increasingly affecting people over the age of 40.
Doctors called the early symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease.
The first alarming sign can be considered vision problems, due to which the patient acquires difficulty in recognizing objects.
Another sign of developing dementia experts have called aphasia - a condition when a person can't find the right words to convey what he wants to say.
Neurologist asked to send Saakashvili for treatment abroad
Former Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili needs psycho-nerve treatment and rehabilitation abroad, neurologist Otar Toidze, who is a member of a medical council set up under Georgia’s ombudsman, told reporters.
His [Saakashvili] neurological status is leading in his disease.
Stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, variability of character," the expert said, noting that this does not go beyond the regulatory framework and now the ex-president needs to be sent to special rehabilitation.
"This is what we call neurorehabilitation and psycho-nervous rehabilitation, the possibility of which we did not find in Georgia," Toidze said, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution that does not exist in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began sabotaging medical care after prison officials subjected him to disciplinary punishment.
Georgian policy quickly succeeded in abolishing the punishment and restoring itself to its former rights.

Protests against Covid passports in Spain
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, protests have taken place against the mandatory certificate of vaccination against COVID-19, according to the agency Europa Press.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants of the action amounted to about 3,000 people.
In Barcelona, COVID passports have become mandatory for treks to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and nightclubs.
Many demonstrators came to the action without masks.
With slogans on their posters, they accused the state of totalitarianism and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required to enter entertainment establishments and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in this city declared a medical dictatorship, and the vaccination was called an experiment.
In Spain, since the beginning of the pandemic, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been detected, and more than 88,000 patients have died.
In Russia, it is also planned to introduce restrictions for the unvaccinated.
The bills on a single system of QR codes were introduced by the government in the State Duma on November 12.
It is assumed that Russians will be able to visit places of mass events, cultural institutions, public catering and retail facilities with the presentation of either a certificate of vaccination or a transferred disease, or a medical discharge from vaccination.
The same rules will be laid down for travel on trains and planes.

A steep rise: how the Chinese become skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create international-level resorts in the country
In China, it is hoped that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, which will allow President Xi Jinping to collect 1 trillion yuan, but also contribute to the economic development of remote provinces.
The Taiwan ski resort in Zhangjiakou, located near the Winter Olympic Games, is becoming increasingly popular with the Chinese.
In addition to the construction of infrastructure in the region, landscaping is also being carried out: workers planting trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international competitions.
In many regions of China, where resorts are located, including Zhangjiakou, there are problems with snow.
The main task in the long term is to provide a comfortable and interesting holiday in Chinese resorts, so that all newcomers become regulars.
However, it is still a long way off.
Gaming consultant Justin Downs says that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese ski industry has changed into unrecognizable.
Every year, more and more Chinese go to the slopes in winter.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, one of them.
Despite the major changes, it will take many years to create a skiing culture here, Downs believes.
Many of the resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions still need to actively develop and create the necessary infrastructure for recreation there.
70-year-old Gao Makong lives in Chunli, near the venues for the Winter Olympics.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism here.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway was built from Beijing to Chunli, and now none of the locals are suffering without a job.
More and more shops are opening in the country, selling clothes and equipment for winter sports.
On the slopes open points of general food with dishes of national cuisine.
In Taiwan, there is even a testing station for COVID-19.
China is striving to create a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes must become leaders in the biggest international competitions, and the resorts and equipment to reach the world level.
More than 500 million people in the world could face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, the WHO said
More than 500 million people worldwide could be plunged into extreme poverty due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has slowed humanity’s progress on universal access to health services, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB) have said.
In connection with the International Day of Universal Health Coverage on 12 December, WHO and WB have published two complementary reports.
They noted that the pandemic has led to failures in the provision of medical services, caused excessive tensions in health care systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, immunization coverage has decreased, and mortality from tuberculosis and malaria has increased.
The World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) said the pandemic caused “the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it harder for people to pay for treatment.”
This situation pushes more than 500 million people “into extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services out of their pockets.”
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the coronavirus pandemic has impoverished more than 100 million people, and more than four billion people have virtually no social support.

Reuters: Taiwanese minister has been suspended from the broadcast at the Summit for Democracy at the request of the White House
The speech of Taiwan’s Minister of Digital Technology Audrey Tan at the panel discussion during the US-organized Summit for Democracy was translated into a video-free mode, according to a YouTube recording of the summit.
Reuters, citing sources, said the image was disabled at the request of the White House.
According to them, the reason was a map on which Taiwan was distinguished by a separate color from the PRC, which considers the island to be its territory.
The map, shown by Ms. Tan, was compiled by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked the countries of the world in terms of civil rights.
Taiwan was highlighted green on it as "free", and the PRC, DPRK, Laos and Vietnam - red as "closed".
After the minister showed the map, the picture on her side was replaced by a screenshot with the remark that the views of the participants in the discussion "do not necessarily express the position of the US government."
The PRC was not invited to the Summit for Democracy.
Reuters sources note that the map, which was demonstrated by the Taiwanese minister, may have run counter to the policy of “one China” that Washington adheres to.
One of the agency’s sources said that after the demonstration of the map, the U.S. National Security Council was angry with the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The Summit for Democracy, organized by Washington, took place from December 9 to 10 with the participation of representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charities.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the "zero day" of the summit, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta Dmitry Muratov called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be donated to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation Yuri Averyanov said that the summit carried an "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge".

If I go beyond that, I don't throw it away, I don't give it to charity.

Write that they're "stupid, they didn't get their money back."
But how many and when they have children is none of your business until they gather these children to hang on your neck.
And if this is excluded, then what right do you have to condemn them?
It's probably only in education so...
The chosen (self) parents dictate their rules, frankly influencing the already existing ones.
What if this applies to other areas of life, court proceedings, etc.?
The laws are not written for them.
What if the father still implements his method of upbringing and education?

Those who come to cities where land crossing points are located must pass at least one COVID-19 nucleic acid test upon arrival.
The document states that these requirements will apply from the date when the relevant provincial-level administrative units determine and publish the areas of these cities, until March 15, 2022.
In addition, it is noted that cities that have land crossing points and that meet certain conditions may consider setting up buffer zones for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

The Foreign Ministry spoke about the "sad conclusion" in relations between Russia and the United States
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov in an interview with Izvestia assessed the prospects of relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long path of interaction led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries did not begin yesterday.
There is one-sided negative predictability, but in part, the prospect of improving relationships is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion from the long journey we have gone through with the current administration, with Trump and with Obama.
The problems did not begin yesterday," the diplomat said.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are related to the desire of the United States to impose approaches on Russia on many issues.
The Deputy Foreign Minister added that he would not risk giving optimistic forecasts about the prospects of improving relations and would not expect a change in Washington’s position.
He explained that, with the exception of areas such as strategic stability and cybersecurity, there was no progress.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security issues and hopes that the signals will be heard and the Americans will listen to common sense arguments.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov at a meeting with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said that Moscow is ready to resume dialogue with the United States.
The virologist warned about the danger of vaccination with nasal drug from COVID outside hospitals
Vaccinated nasal vaccine from COVID-19 may have allergies and need the help of doctors, so the first points for vaccination with this drug should not be organized in airports and shopping centers.
This was reported by TASS virologist, correspondent member of the RAS, Sergey Netesov, of the Laboratory of Bionanotechnology, Microbiology and Virology of Novosibirsk State University.
Organizing nasal vaccine vaccination sites in airports and shopping malls is easier, but I would do it at first only in medical institutions.
The fact is that the probability of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine is small, but it is desirable for a person to sit next to the doctor's office.
Doctors have special sets of antiallergic drugs that act literally in a minute or two, which sometimes is very necessary," said Netesov.
According to the virologist, it will be possible to think about vaccination in shopping centers when experience in the use of the drug will be accumulated.
He also stressed that when using a nasal vaccine, it is important that it hits the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
At the same time, there is a chance that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the one being vaccinated with congestion of the nose murmurs after injection.

In the UK in a day recorded 1,239 cases of the omicron-strain of the coronavirus - RT in Russian
In the UK, 1,239 cases of infection with a new coronavirus strain were detected per day.
This is reported by Sky News.
In particular, 1196 new cases of the strain "omicron" were recorded in England, 38 people fell ill with a new type of infection in Scotland and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of COVID-19 cases from the new strain in the UK reached 3,137 people.
Scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine previously calculated in a pessimistic forecast that in England by April, 75,000 people could die from an outbreak of the coronavirus caused by the strain "micron".
Peskov warned about the suffering of Western countries, which impose anti-Russian sanctions
Press Secretary of the President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Peskov commented on the possible imposition of anti-Russian sanctions in case of continuation of "aggressive actions" against Ukraine, including due to the alleged "invasion" on the territory of the country.
“It is impossible to impose some restrictions against Russia and not to experience suffering itself,” the Kremlin’s official said on the TV channel “Russia 1”.
Peskov claims that “everyone in the world understands this.”
Earlier it was reported that the United States is considering the possibility of imposing anti-Russian sanctions in the field of energy as an extreme measure.
In addition, Washington and the European Union plan to introduce restrictions that will be aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles into dollars in relation to Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
The head of Sberbank, Herman Gref, is convinced that this is impossible.

Residents of New Caledonia reject the idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the vast majority of participants refused to leave France.
This was reported on 12 December by the French television channel BFM.TV.
96.5% of voters voted against independence.
Supported independence from France 3.51% of the population of the archipelago in the South Pacific.
The results of 2.99% of the ballots were canceled.
The level of participation in the vote on this day was very low: about 55% of the inhabitants of the archipelago came to the sites.
According to experts, the low turnout is due to the separatists' calls to refuse to participate in the referendum because of the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, the people of New Caledonia voted in a referendum against independence from France.
In 2018, a referendum on independence was held in the region.
Most of the inhabitants supported the location of the archipelago in France.
New Caledonia is located almost 20,000 kilometers from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its possession.
About 270,000 people live in the archipelago, the territory has a special administrative and territorial status.
The 1998 agreement between Paris and the New Caledonian administration allows the region to hold a vote on its independence twice, with a difference of two years.

WHO Preliminarily Considers “Micron” Less Dangerous Than “Delta”
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the “micron” is less dangerous than the delta strain of the coronavirus.
However, there is evidence of a decrease in the effectiveness of vaccines in the disease with a new variant of COVID-19.
As of December 9, the micron has been registered in 63 countries.
"Preliminary data and a significantly altered antigenic profile of the protein of the strain 'micron' suggest a decrease in the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and transmission of the variant.
According to preliminary findings from South Africa, it is assumed that it ("the severity of the disease" - ed.) may be less severe than that of the "delta", - said in a technical report of the WHO.
The organization notes that so far, all recorded cases of “micron” infection in the EU are easily or asymptomatically.
However, the new strain, according to preliminary data, spreads faster "delta".
In Russia, two cases of infection with an omicron strain have been registered.
They were “previously immunized,” the Gamalei Name Center reported.
Rospotrebnadzor head Anna Popova said that there is currently no reliable evidence that the new variant of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the rest.

In Ukraine named four scenarios for Zelensky
The former deputy of the Verkhovna Rada Vadim Denisenko listed four options for the development of events for the President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky in 2022.
According to him, the head of state may remain without the support of the West, and may also make compromises on the Donbas.
On Sunday, December 12, Denisenko told in a publication on the portal "Glavred".
The first option, which Denisenko called the "ideal storm", suggests that Ukraine will stop supporting key Western countries, having reached an agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
Such developments will contribute to the deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
“In parallel, there is a decrease in the prices of key goods that we traditionally export . . . internal protests and the confrontation of power with key FPGs (financial-industrial groups. - Ed.) “, - added the ex-parliamentary.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario of the development of the situation - "war against all".
This forecast will come true in the event of high turbulence in world politics, in which the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Because of this situation, the leadership of Ukraine can make compromises on the Donbass, as a result of which there is a possibility of confrontation within the country.
At the end of the summer, Zelensky's positions will weaken, the probability of such a situation, according to the former deputy minister, is up to 50-55%.
The third option of the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is the confrontation of dissenting population groups with Zelensky and the president, which is why it is likely to seize control of the power bloc and implement "populist initiatives".
In the course of such a variant of the crisis, Zelensky will begin the “reformatting of power”, Denisenko added.
Another scenario is the transformation of Zelensky into the "father of the nation".
This can lead to some event that will be a strong shock to society.
"The event should be large enough to provoke a reaction from external partners and lead to increased support for Ukraine," Denisenko said.
Such a variant of the development of the situation is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a technogenic catastrophe or aggressive actions of Russia, says the ex-deputy.
At the same time, the Russian side has repeatedly rejected any possibility of an “attack” on Ukraine.
In Moscow, it was the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States that are increasing military activity at the Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, data from the sociological group Rating showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president fell to a record low, amounting to 19.3%.
This is the lowest figure since his election as head of state.
Analysts predicted a situation in which in the case of the upcoming elections of the President of Ukraine for Zelensky would give their vote only 21.8%, while for the former president of the country Petro Poroshenko - 14.5%.
Of all the respondents, only 19.3% expressed support for the president.

Thanks to the author for the story about the great athlete, I did not know that Elena Shushunova died, it is very sad to know this.
I remember how I was sick for her at the Olympics in Seoul, for us, the inhabitants of the Primorsky region, it was a live broadcast, real time.
Such a surge of passions, emotions swelled, I remember the joy when Elena won.
They were also happy with the rest of the victories, as they suffered for Salnikov, for the footballers, for all the then Soviet athletes.
On TV, I saw a documentary about one of the Central American countries, and there watermelons rolled down the steps of the ship like barrels.
The watermelons were monstrous in size.
I myself many times in my youth worked on cleaning and loading watermelons in the Astrakhan region and did not meet watermelons weighing more than pudding.
I buy watermelons weighing 4-5 kg directly from Bahchi and not before the beginning of August.
Bra-balcony with soft lace cups (size: 90E, color beige, composition: 90% polyamide, 10% elastane, article: 12008).
Bra-balcony with soft lace cups, on the frames.
The lower part of the cup is reinforced by a non-elastic transparent cloth.
The lateral inner part of the cup, in the area of the seam strap, is reinforced by a non-elastic fabric in the fold, without additional seams for comfort.
It is this element that prevents the lace from stretching.
The richness of the lace can be appreciated thanks to the feston on the neckline and under the breast.
Vertical bones on the side panels of single-layer microfiber do not allow the fabric to rotate at large sizes.

Arrested for the action on the Red Square, the poet: "For the quote Yevtushenko gives 10 days, here she is, the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, the 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenko was arrested for ten days.
A HSE student was detained in Red Square with a poster on which was written the hashtag #poetrussiamorechempoet.
This quote belongs to the writer Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
Alexander was drafted a protocol on the administrative article on the repeated violation of the procedure for holding a public action.
For the first time he was detained on January 23 in Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
“The goal was to attract attention to poetry in general, now interest in it is unfortunately lost, to the decline of the common culture in Russia and also little hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems on the Internet under this hashtag,” explains Alexander.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of the detention and to reveal the message of his message in more detail.
How have you been treated by the police this time and before?
What did you ask in the department, how did you comment on your action?
This time, the staff were more correct, the detention as much as possible, polite, no matter how funny it sounds in some context of the word.
Pushkinskaya was taken by the OMONovts and took hard.
Asked by default, about motives.
When they heard, in principle, looked, if not approving, then understanding.
With the exception of the four-sided monkey, everything was perfectly correct, but I knew what I was going for.
And if after the action under this hashtag they start writing their poems, at least a few people, I will not sit these 10 days in vain.
Maxim, according to the protocol, speak alone at least in the language of the Tumba-Yumba tribe.
And at public and official events, they speak in the language of others, so that everyone can understand what happened in the Bundestag on September 25, 2001, or in their native language through an interpreter.
This is a protocol and nothing more, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks perfectly in Russian and still resorts to the help of an interpreter.
And also at official events, a transcription of the old autorukhka is held, and the stenographer does not have to know several languages.

Researchers Tell Us How Potatoes Help Fight Age Disorders
The study found that potatoes are rich in vitamins and trace elements that help improve blood circulation and lower cholesterol levels.
The root fruit contains vitamins of group B, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic and pantothenic acids.
All these elements help the body’s systems to function.
In addition, potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders.
Due to the large content of the anklet, it is useful for the gastrointestinal tract, and with regular use can also help in the prevention of hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the greatest benefit, it is better to stew or boil the carrots, rather than fry on butter.
Previously, The Daily Express warned that potatoes could be dangerous for diabetics, like other foods with high glycemic index.
These are carbohydrate-containing foods that quickly break down into sugars, such as sugar, sweet soft drinks, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the Kommersant newspaper warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a reduction in its production in personal auxiliary farms and an increase in processing capacities.
According to market participants, the shortage of products at the moment can replace only imports.

The Micropacket is the most high-frequency of all the Dimax spring blocks, so it has a pronounced orthopedic effect and is considered premium.
Fillers: combinations of layers of koira and natural latex are installed on the top and bottom of the springs.
The only difference is the order of the plates.
If one surface has latex, the other has coconut coir.

If the koira provides proper support for the back, then the latex gives adaptation of the surface under the human body.
Cover: the model comes in a stretched knitted cover Aloe Vera.
At the customer's request, it can be made both removable and stationary.
The total height of the product - 27 cm, the recommended load on the sleeping place - 170 kg.

Estonian scientists will search for life on Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in cooperation with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, the state-of-the-art camera said on Sunday.
The goal of the five-year missions is to assess the suitability for life of the clouds of Venus and then search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists proposed tools to measure the acidity and oxygen content of Venus’ clouds.
Until now, it was assumed that the clouds of Venus, the planet closest to Earth, were too acidic for life to exist, but Venus was probably originally an Earth-type planet.
During the third mission, a sample must arrive from Venus.
Suppose that if we find life there, the main question will be whether it is similar to earthly or different.
If it is very similar, it will be obvious that earthly life did not begin on Earth.
If it is different, then it may be more likely that life originated on Earth, "- said the head of the Estonian project "Venus Life Finder" Michel Paiusalu.

Meta-universes will change Russian business
The metaverse theme became popular in the fall of this year, when Mark Zuckerberg announced the transformation of Facebook into Meta.
For the market, this event has become an important signal: the biggest player has confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
This means that businesses in Russia, as well as around the world, will invest in the creation of their own metaverses and their subsequent monetization.
Meta-universes should be seen as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the trend to create remote interactions in the context of a pandemic, because people are tired of division and limitations.
On the other hand, this is a consequence of the business’s desire to develop ecosystems and adapt operating models to them.
With the third - they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitalization of assets, when any rights, securities, works of art and even money go into digital format.
Ania, you are right, changing your diet is a conscious process.
When you start eating right, you no longer want something too fat and harmful.
Of course, we're going to have a traditional olivia and a herring under our coats, but no one makes me eat it all at once.
You can eat on a spoon, try - and that's enough.
After all, in advance and really ten days off, you can prepare any tasty and useful dishes.

The British economist could not give a forecast for 2022
The British economist Jim O’Neill could not give a forecast for 2022, because he believes such attempts will fail.
He wrote about it in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change the turnover.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, and in the second place - inflation, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he does not know whether the price increase for the goods is temporary or not.
As the expert pointed out, even before the pandemic, it was clear that “the world of infinite generosity of central banks has already outlived itself” and it is time to return to a relationship where inflationary interest rates will correlate with the expected rate of GDP growth.
O’Neill noted that against the backdrop of the pandemic, the continuation of ultra-soft economic policy may, according to some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
In addition, attention should be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as rising levels of poverty and climate change, O'Neill summed up.
Earlier, Mikhail Shulgin, head of global research at the Department of Investment Discovery, said that the positive expectations for the dollar’s exchange rate for 2022 remain, while the growth potential will be less significant.
Among the risks to the dollar exchange rate, Shulgin called the monetary policy of the Fed, the dynamics of oil prices and fears against the background of the coronavirus pandemic.
I have to agree.
But there is one thing that makes me happy: if you compare yourself to yourself, five years ago there were fewer containers.

Russians gave auto dealers about 4.5% of the country’s GDP
According to the results of 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on the purchase of new cars, which is 28% more than in the same period of last year, according to statistics of the agency Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI).
To understand the scale - about the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
Last September, at a meeting of the heads of countries of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that this amount is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
In terms of revenues in the Russian market, the Korean brand Kia leads.
For 10 months of this year, it managed to sell cars for the amount of 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than the year before.
The growth of the Kia-related brand Hyundai is even more significant - more than 35%, and the revenue from the sale of cars is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
In the leading positions, this brand and the increase in the weighted average price of the car - for the year Hyundai it grew by almost 21%, to 1.94 million rubles - stronger dynamics of travel was only with Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz.
At the same time, sales of Korean brands increased not so significantly: according to the statistics of the Committee of automakers of the Association of European Business in Russia, in quantitative terms, Kia sold 9.4% more cars over the same period than a year earlier.
Hyundai - almost 12%.
Closes the top three in terms of sales in monetary terms Japanese Toyota - on cars of this brand Russians spent in 10 months 275.5 billion rubles, which is 14% more than the year before.
The Japanese followed Mercedes-Benz with a figure of 266.1 billion rubles (+75%) - the German premium brand also increased its sales volume (by 37%), and the weighted average price of the car (almost 28%, up to 8.2 million rubles).
“Mercedes-Benz has seen a good increase in sales and a weighted average price at the same time – more than, for example, BMW – hence greater growth in financial capacity,” said Tatiana Arabagi, CEO of NAPI.
At the pace of sales growth, fantastic figures show Chinese brands, which have also significantly increased their financial capacity this year.”
The Russian Lada on the dynamics of revenue growth shows average market figures (plus 28%), for cars of this brand Russians spent in 10 months 229.4 billion rubles.
At the level of last year's financial capacity are companies whose car sales in pieces in 2021 fell: in particular, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ and quite in the minus - for 10 months, the Russians spent on SUVs and pickups of this brand 12 billion rubles against 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Against the background of problems with the supply of auto components and production disruptions, covering the entire world auto industry, auto companies continue to continuously adjust prices - the same "AutoVAZ" increased the cost of Lada models seven times a year, the last increase (by 8-10 thousand rubles) occurred in the end.
Price lists for their products and other car manufacturers are regularly rewritten.
The volumes of the Russian car market in monetary terms will continue to increase - in addition to the shortage of cars, inflation contributes to this, as well as the desire of automakers to recover from past losses, experts say.
In the context of car shortages, I think that many car companies have even been able to partially pass on to the consumer the costs of past periods, which they could not put in the price of cars before,
says the analyst of VTB Capital in the auto industry Vladimir Bespalov. -
I believe that in financial terms, automakers are feeling very well right now, maintaining a high sales margin.”
A direct indicator of this is the rate of growth in the value of cars, which is observed during 2021, prices for new cars are growing faster than inflation, the expert specifies.
In the long term, the market will grow both in quantitative terms and in monetary terms, but mainly due to inflation and the complexity of the design of the machines themselves, Bespalov predicts.
As the supply increases, the opportunities for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian car market will continue to grow and in the coming year, even if the growth in the cost of cars slows down, car manufacturers will be able to get their income from volumes, says independent automotive consultant Sergey Burgazliev.
Given the increased demand and insufficient supply, now car manufacturers are striving to get the most profit from each car sold, notes Burgazliev. -
The increase in the volume of production of machines is not expected at least in the next six months, while in Russia the excitement is also heated by the uncertainty of citizens in the future.
Against the background of the current market situation, cars proved to be a good object for investment - a car bought a year ago, even with a mileage, now it is possible to sell more expensive than the original value, says the expert.
Biden said about the transfer of the US military to Ukraine in the event of the invasion of Russia
The U.S. leadership has never considered sending U.S. troops to Ukraine in the event of Russia’s “invasion.”
This statement was made by U.S. President Joe Biden.
"There have never been any such plans," the White House chief said, responding to a journalist's question as to whether the United States had abandoned such an idea.
Biden said that in the event of an escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia will face economic consequences.
At the same time, he stressed that the United States and NATO have no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of an escalation.
The American leader also said that the possibility of using American troops unilaterally for the defense of Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades the territory of Ukraine, the United States will transfer its forces to the Eastern European NATO countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Estonia).
“We will have to send more U.S. and NATO troops to the eastern flank, the B9 – all those NATO countries against which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack by Russia,” Biden said.
Earlier, the press secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov stressed that Moscow has no intention to invade the territory of Ukraine.
At the same time, he pointed out that Moscow sees the problem in the combat use of the drones supplied by Turkey by Kiev, as well as in the fact that "American weapons are approaching our territory".

If a fraudster calls from such a number, such as an "employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs" or another force structure, it is ineffective to immediately drop, and to put on the blacklist, most likely not to have time.
Because to confirm his lie about involvement in power structures, he quickly repeats the challenge and continues to frighten and persuade.
We need more useful advice for the people.
That's bullshit.
I can't believe it was like that.

As shown by the regular friendly meetings of the presidents of Russia, Azerbaijan, Turkey, in my opinion, you are, to put it mildly, not in the subject.
Only yesterday, the President of Azerbaijan approved the opening of a joint Azerbaijani-Russian enterprise KamAZ.
