The American Gymnastics Federation supports the letter of the U.S. Olympic Committee and accepts the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the statement by the USOC (United States Olympic Committee) that the interests of our athletes and clubs, as well as their sport, could be better served by moving forward and making significant changes within our organization, rather than by revoking accreditation.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that could shed light on how the abuse of the proportion so bravely described by the survivors of Larry Nassar has been unnoticed for so long and adopts any necessary and appropriate change.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC have the same goal: to make gymnastics, as well as other sports, as safe as possible for athletes to pursue their dreams in a safe, positive and accountable environment.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional layout.
Scientists say the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown on the top and pale or carotenoid in color on the bottom.
This discovery also makes it possible to better understand the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a fully developed stem, called spines, but do show other characteristics specific to feathers – beards and beards – the researchers concluded that the spine was probably a later evolutionary development to these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight but rather for temperature regulation or display.The researchers suggested that, even if it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult feathering and not the down of a chick.
Scientists point out that this is indeed the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, but the sample reveals a plumage belonging to an adult individual, not a young one.
A car exploded at police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 others.

They found that the Sun worked according to the same basic principles as the other stars, and the activity of all the stars in the system is determined by their brightness, their rotation, and nothing else.
Brightness and rotation are used together to determine the number of Rossbys of a star, which is related to the plasma flow.
In terms of magnetic reversals, the smaller the number of Rossbys, the less active the star is.

The work was mainly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by the tidal forces between the galaxy's black matter and the Milky Way's black matter.
Just as the moon exerts a pull on the earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that black matter affects other black matter in the same way as normal matter.
According to this theory, most of the black matter around a galaxy is in a kind of halo, and is made up of a large number of small particles.

“They are cooler than the surrounding surface by day and warmer at night.”
"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of the planet's large caves that maintain a constant temperature, but they are similar in that they are deep holes in the earth," said Glen Cushing, a member of the USGS (American Center for Geological Studies) crew and staff at the University of Arizona in Northern Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, put in an envelope a sheet of pre-printed paper indicating the candidate of their choice.
After the officers have verified his identity, the voter throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs his voter card.
The French Electoral Code regulates operations quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballots must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelopes are present at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added, except those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to attend each stage of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under high supervision, according to specific procedures.

She first participated in the slalom, where she obtained a "did not finish" (DNF) in her first race. 36 of the 116 competitors obtained the same result in this race.
His other race, the giant slalom, allowed him to finish in tenth place in the group of women sitting with a combined time of 4:41.30, which is 2:11.60 minutes less than the Austrian Claudia Loesch, first finish, and 1:09.02 minutes less than the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, ninth finish.
In the category of women skiers sitting, four skiers failed to complete their course; in terms of giant slalom, 45 skiers out of a total of 117 in this race failed to qualify.
Police in Madhya Pradesh have recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said: “We arrested five people for raping the Swiss national, and we recovered her phone and laptop.”
The defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused had their faces hidden when they appeared in court.
Although three people were present in the house when the car hit her, none were injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The track where the accident occurred was temporarily blocked to allow emergency services to extract the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son by the Sheriff Court of Edinburgh.
She is in custody pending her trial, but eyewitness accounts could be compromised as her portrait has been widely disseminated.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and the courts considered the publication of photos to be potentially detrimental.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, of the University of Dundee, notes that “journalists seem to follow a dangerous line if they publish photos, etc. of suspects.”
The Office of the Crown Prosecutor, which is in charge of all prosecutions, has told reporters that no further comment will be made at least until the indictment is filed.
According to the leak, the document will focus on the border dispute that Palestine claims on the basis of pre-Middle East war borders.
Other topics discussed include the future State of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of ten years from the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority only consents to a period of five years.
The shooters of the additional pest control trial had to be closely monitored by rangers, as the trial was controlled and its effectiveness assessed.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) inc., qualified volunteers were recruited, as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting head of conservation of the park and heritage at NPWS, the four shooters designated for the first slaughter campaign have been duly trained and trained in safety guidelines.
Martelly announced a new Provisional Electoral Council (PEC) consisting of nine members.
This is Martelly’s fifth PEC in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures aimed at engaging the country on the path of new elections.
This commission was Martelly’s response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the absence of elections, some of which were due to take place in 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating of defective iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called “non-serious.”
The ministry responded by calling Apple’s postponement of the report “really regrettable.”
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 a.m. local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office said no damage had been reported in the country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage by diverting their bus to Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and the deaths of at least six of them have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released prematurely, as were Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a medical career.
He trained as an obstetrician, and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working in the hospital, Liggins began investigating preterm births during his spare time.
Her research has shown that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the lung maturation of the baby.
The Xinhua agency reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders (or “black boxes”) on Wednesday.
The other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: “Luna was the first queen of the extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of two moons. A unique moment, just like her. A strong woman.”
Dustin “Goldust” Runnels commented that “Luna was as weird as me...or even more...I love her and I’m going to miss her...I hope she’s resting in a better place.”
A survey of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal elections found that the number of opponents of Australia's transformation into a republic had increased by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of respondents share this view, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch to rule Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim in the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his fitness was questioned.
He was not able to take the necessary medications to overcome his pain, these being prohibited within the Games.
Curtis Cooper, mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered on January 25 the largest prime number known to date.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water for the earth, as well as organic matter that can form proteins and promote life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and more specifically how Earth formed, since comets collided with it a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors “political chatter and nonsense.”
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, limiting carbon emissions.
It relies on satellite technologies, not the ground-based radar systems used before, allowing air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more detailed information.
Additional transportation is non-existent and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and relay car parks and parks are not available on the ground.
The fear of lack of transport created the possibility that the match could be played behind closed doors, without the supporters of the teams.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the genesis of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from the University of Princeton in the United States and the University of Uppsala in Sweden reported that the new species had evolved in only two generations, although this process was estimated to be much longer, following reproduction between an endemic Darwin pineapple, Geospiza fortis, and the conical-beaked immigrant pineapple, Ge.
Gold can be shaped in many ways. It can be rolled into tiny pieces
It can be drawn into fine yarn, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very fine, and glued onto another metal. It can be so fine that it has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "enlightened manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of the cabbage juice changes depending on the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electrons (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then, with clean and wet hands, squeeze them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will induce a strange sensation and produce a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets equipped with a watershed in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of sewer systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women met.
When you call a person who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite receives the call in space and then sends it back to Earth, almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 30 meters high to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in many ways. The biggest advantage it has brought us is that it has made transportation much simpler and faster.
This brought us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below are medium-sized cats that eat equally medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and other deer.
In addition, there are many small cats (including free companion cats) that eat much more small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of a niche, a special task assigned to each feline, preventing it from competing with others.
Lions are the most sociable cats, living in large groups called packs.
The packs are composed of one to three related adult males, as well as about thirty females and lions.
Women are usually very close to each other, their family being made up of a large number of sisters and daughters.
Lion troops act like packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in their behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (but sometimes difficult), swim, jump long distances and pull with five times the strength of a powerful human.
The tiger belongs to the same family (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones able to roar.
The roar of the tiger does not resemble the roar of the lion, but rather a phrase whose words would be cries and rumblings.
The ocelots are fond of small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than him.
According to scientists, ocelots track and find animals to eat (preys) by smell, sniffing their way on the ground.
They see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision, and also move very stealthyly. The ocelots track their prey by melting into their environment before throwing themselves on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it comes (for example, if it moves over a mountain range or river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily go back), it often finds itself in a different environment than it was in.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need new features or adaptations to be a powerful competitor to what it previously needed.
The original population has not changed at all, it always needs the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they can no longer be considered to belong to the same species.
We call this process "speciation," which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e. exhale).
Plants produce their food using the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes and clothes based on plants. Most of the foods we eat are plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The mosasaur was the superpredator of the time, he feared nothing except the other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth like razor blades, as well as an additional series of teeth in the palate, so that everything that crossed his path could not escape.
We're not sure, but he may have had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and he may even have been cannibalized.
He also attacked everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur such as a T. rex was not sized against him.
Although the Romans ate food as we know it, they ate some strange or unusual festive dishes, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and the blonde, a kind of rodent.
Another difference: while the poor and the woman ate their food while sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to organize banquets together where they rested on the side while eating their meal.
Ancient Roman meals could not include those foods of American or Asian origin that were introduced to Europe centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Romans ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a main temple that was considered the dwelling place of the god.
People were making sacrifices to the gods and priests were trying to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivities.
Each temple had an open courtyard, and then an inner sanctuary that only priests could access.
Some pyramidal towers, the ziggurats, were sometimes built as elements of a temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family was in the open air.
The women were cooking in the courtyard; the shops were only open counters overlooking the street; the houses were built of stone.
As there were no large forests in the land of Canaan, the wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and in the Scandinavian sagas it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder which he found in Greenland — and named it so — while traveling further west.
But regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at the time.
Although each country is "Scandinavian", there are many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the film Benjamin Gates and the Treasure of the Templars, you may think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is an inscription on the back of the document, it is not a treasure card.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4 July 1776" could be found on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although no one really knows who wrote it, it is known that at an early stage of its existence, the large parchment (which measures about 29 inches three quarters out of 24 inches) was stored rolled.
It is therefore likely that the rating was added simply as a label.
The landing of Day J and the subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the French of Vichy, French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupier instead of confronting him.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in southern France, an invasion called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Forces de la France Libre had liberated southern France and headed for Germany.
A civilization is a singular culture shared by a large group of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
The term "civilization" is derived from the Latin word "civilis", which means civil and is related to the Latin words "civil", which means citizen, and "civitas", which means big city or city-state and which also indicates, in a way, the size of the society to which it refers.
Cities-States are the forerunners of nations. A civilizational culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a sustainable cultural footprint and a fair distribution.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—the Congress being its only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress did not have the power to impose taxes and, as there was no national executive or judicial power, it turned to the authorities of the state, often uncooperative, to enforce all its acts.
Nor did it have the power to derogate from the tax laws or the laws on customs duties between States.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all States before they could be amended, and States took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, with the German national team, the second most titled team in the world and it won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the group of islands that make up it, Japan is often referred to geographically as an archipelago.
Early information about Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, while European navigators passing by referred to it as Ilha Formosa, or “beautiful island.”
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, introducing a transformation of indigenous cereal production practices and employing Chinese workers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared it a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, which then ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings adjacent to the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better view of their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and this restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photographic format in the world is 35 mm; it was the most common film format at the end of the analog film era.
It is still manufactured today, but what matters is that its image format is inherited from the digital camera’s photographic sensor format.
The 35 mm format is actually, and it's pretty baffling, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
It is therefore said that the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest of integer ratios) is 3:2.
Many common formats (family of APS formats, for example) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The third-party rule, which is heavily abused and often ridiculed, is a simple directive that creates dynamism while offering protection to the image.
It indicates that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was questioned.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has linked European states to each other despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone, from the king to the roturier.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth must be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church’s monetary funds are there specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over 1,000 years and this concentration of power and money has led many people to wonder if this doctrine was respected.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain set up a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy has proved effective, cutting vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade has violated generally accepted international law and codified by several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from venturing into entire maritime areas, posing a threat even to neutral ships.
As this tactic only aroused a timid reaction, Germany expected a similar reaction to its limitless submarine war.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations showed a penchant for pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of the war during the First World War, the nations wished to prevent such a situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four hundred in his name, a poetry book and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his director in his previous job) to the attention of Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing the different eras; each stage of China or each family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also an unstable age of divided provinces. The best known of these periods is the Three Kingdoms era which took place for 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
During these periods, fierce struggles took place between many members of the nobility who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in Chinese history, with thousands of people killed in battle to sit on the throne of the great XI'an palace.
There are many social and political repercussions such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single leader.
Also, after the Revolution, the trades were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
The same goes for the army, because the classification of armies is no longer based on class, but on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working classes in other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that went beyond the framework of this worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that became famous as "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which survived at the time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, it's not easy to find, even if you know it exists. When you enter the cave, you are completely isolated.
Above, you can see nothing but the clear and beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains.From the inside of the cave, you can see or hear very little of this universe.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians during the third millennium BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many giant structures erected in honor of the deceased pharaohs.
The plateau of Giza, or "necropolis of Giza", in the valley of the Dead in Egypt, contains several pyramids (the great pyramid being the most imposing), several small tombs, many temples and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Cheops, and many small pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor his wives and family members.
The “push” symbol resembles a V and the “pull” symbol resembles a staple or a square whose lower side is missing.
The top means you have to start with the tip and push the bow, and the bottom means you have to start with the rise (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
A bow to the top usually produces a softer sound, while a bow to the bottom is stronger and more assertive.
Do not hesitate to register your own marks in pencil, but do not forget that the printed bow marks are for a musical reason, and therefore they must generally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old) and the king's sister, Madame <0xC3><0x89>lisabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of saleswomen.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people screaming and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The king and queen were forced, because of the crowd, to open the windows of their chariots.
At one point, a member of the crowd brandished the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the terrorized Queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover much of the expenses and interest on bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking institutions.
Of course, the superprofits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people could constitute the fundamental advantages of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of order.
These events took place in the period generally considered the High Middle Ages – period of history in Europe running from the 11th to the 13th century (1000-1300).
The Central Middle Ages were preceded by the Upper Middle Ages and followed by the Lower Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense that the fate of humanity is dictated by an underlying logic related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies.
Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself takes place in a process far beyond cultural and political influences, and technology has an impact on intrinsically rather than socially conditioned societies.
For example, it could be said that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, which is why new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Massive possession of cars also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, leading to the invention of new techniques in the field of health care to treat bodily injuries.
Romanticism presented an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
According to the theories of Romanticism, geography would have shaped individuals and, over time, customs and culture related to this geography would have appeared, which, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to laws imposed arbitrarily.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was regarded as that of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicentre of luxury began around the year 400, and lasted until around 1100.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders took charge of gifts such as silk and spices, with which the Byzantine markets could hardly compete.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style experienced its climax between the 10th–11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, the dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slowness of the means of communication, Western modes could experience a delay of 25 to 30 years.
During the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time, following the Crusades, was the use of buttons to close clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is an agriculture practiced to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, system using preserved seeds from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and share the same ideas, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The criteria that determine a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their belonging by a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which encompasses fashions, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune or voluntary abuse, were not socialized by adults during their childhood.
Some wild children were confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of this child was due to the rejection by the parents of a serious intellectual or physical disability that the child was suffering from.
Wild children may have suffered severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fled.
Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in nature.
When raised entirely by non-human species, wild children exhibit behaviors (within the limits of their physical dispositions) almost identical to those of the animals that raised them, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project pedagogy should make learning easier and more interesting, support goes further.
Support is not a method of learning but rather a means of helping learners who discover a new teaching such as the use of a new program or the start of a new project.
Supports can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but the little trombone man from Microsoft Office is one as well.
Virtual scaffolding is built into the software and is intended to interrogate, guide, and explain procedures that could have been too difficult to manage for the student alone.
Children are placed in foster families for a wide variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, caring and educational, but it is.
We perceive the family placement system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster family placement system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
The foster family placement is supposed to provide all the necessities that were missing in the home from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approach to uses and rewards.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are considered to be major factors in favor of the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuous relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied the public's reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to great discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, i.e. facial expressions for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, pointed out how people who can't understand speech due to brain damage are still able to accurately assess sincerity.
It even suggests that such abilities of interpretation of human behavior may be found in animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the reserve of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination alternate the variations between the two basins at each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a human-like digestive system to meet its amino acid needs from available plant resources.
In addition, a lack of response has serious consequences: growth disorders, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins contained in the leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (worms, termites, eggs) are easy to digest while providing a large amount of protein containing all the vital amino acids.
All in all, we shouldn’t be surprised if our own ancestors solved their “protein problem” a bit in the same way that savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentional awakening during your sleep period and drowsiness shortly after (from 10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively silent awakening, in order to make you regain consciousness without waking up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock during your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids before going to sleep (including water or tea, known to be diuretic), which forces you to wake up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace of a person is opposed to the degree of tension in his body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the vital force present. Each person has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that hinders this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been enriched by the path of Mahayana love and by many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of deity. It is through the visualization of different deities that the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras activated, and the consciousness of awakening created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, the deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures ended the agreement between these two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would see real clashes, through substitute armies, on battlefields as well in Africa as in Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
But these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union arrived and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian front after invading the eastern regions of Poland, thus violating the Peace Treaty of Riga and the international treaty of non-aggression.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The Marines’ job has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and property, while interfering with your enemy’s ability to move his people and property.
One of the most notable recent examples of this situation was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans were trying to get soldiers and equipment to cross the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, mainly using U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as it did for the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them close to them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that wandered on hills or other pastures, often cared for by goats who were mostly children or adolescents, similar to the more well-known term of shepherds. These pastoral methods are still in use today.
The “wagonways” were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagon tracks were simply made up of parallel wooden boards, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach higher speeds and draw higher loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the day.
The junctions were introduced early enough to keep the tracks in place; however, it was gradually realized that the tracks would be more efficient if they were fitted with an iron strip on top.
This has become common practice, but iron has caused more wear on the wooden wheels of wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails appeared.
The very first means of locomotion was walking: humans started walking standing up two million years ago with the arrival of Homo Erectus (“right man”).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, did not walk upright as usual.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus was able to walk on two legs already seven million years ago.
We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even fight in order to alleviate future suffering.
In many cases, this is a symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want only a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is clear that the world has changed a lot thanks to the scientific and technological advances made by human beings, and that the problems have become more important due to the overpopulation and the extravagant way of life of humanity.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few streets away to John Dunlap's printing house.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as Dunlap Broadsides.
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the Independence Hall court on July 8.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had him read to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap sheets of which the existence is still known are the oldest copies of the document. The original manuscript copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs has survived and is still alive. They are called birds.
Few people consider them to be dinosaurs given that they have wings and can fly.
But there are a lot of things about birds that still look like a dinosaur.
They have legs covered with scales and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like T-Rexes.
Virtually all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers, or bits to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be visible immediately. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are sufficiently general that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of drugs or toxic domestic chemicals.
Consult the label for first aid instructions specific to this poison.
The term “insect” is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from an ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are very suitable insects to parasitize humans.
Reduves, like bed bugs, are nidicolous, that is, adapted to live in the nest or habitat of their host.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, composed of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may very well feel that it is not in their interest, nor in that of the child, to take care of the upbringing of a baby.
These couples may choose to do an adoption project for their baby.
As part of an adoption, biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method guides most scientific research.
However, it is not the only experiment, and an experiment is a test that serves to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, ask questions and make observations, but also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have focused on ancient texts, and in particular on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline of knowledge of the Greek, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue an operating cycle for a certain period of time, even in the absence of external stimulation.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments to mark either phage DNA with a radioactive phosphorus or phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the part of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only germ cell mutations can be passed on to children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism is of interest to people wishing to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, in particular the fauna and flora.
Hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying ecosystem information are examples of on-site activities.
For example, one can go see, photograph and discover the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small country towns by car to go to their workplace and meet other people who are going to work in the countryside they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to a transport system based on passenger cars and supports it.
Science now shows that this massively carbon-based economy has dislodged the biosphere from its state of stability that has supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is part of the company and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear as many complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and particular vehicles between two points, and the interactions they exert between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the flow of traffic because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act within a reasonably consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically approximately.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow rate, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of road installations.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to escape their enemies and find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
This gives them a larger number of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and ephemeral flies.
A few thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system was moving around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second-longest and largest river on Earth and carries more than eight times the volume of water of the second-largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on the planet, sometimes reaching 10 km wide.
No less than 20% of the water that flows from the planet’s rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main arm of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and collects water from thousands of small rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Empire, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed by their size and the technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Empire were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, who were then well over a thousand years old.
The Vatican has about 800 inhabitants, the smallest independent country in the world, and the least populous.
The Vatican City drafts its legislation and official communications in Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The citizens of Vatican City are all Catholics.
Since ancient times, people are familiar with basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, as they are found in nature in raw form and are fairly simple to mine using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
Rather, it was the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he also issued the theory that the latter are transformed into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table has many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that comprise a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could enter the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, the advent of new writing modes has relegated the pen to a more confidential status and rarer uses.
People now write messages on computer screens, without ever having to approach a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when the next novelty arrives.
The fission bomb works according to the following principle: it transforms energy by assembling a nucleus of a myriad of protons and neutrons.
It's kind of like climbing a hill with a heavy cart, splitting the core again, and then releasing a little bit of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, so they tend to break with little or no pressure.
The surface of the moon is made up of stones and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the visible face and 100 km on the hidden face.
It is thinner at sea level and thicker under the continents.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to come back to the surface.
Content theories are centered on researching what makes people feel good or that they are attracted to.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories examine what drives some people to want the things they do and what, in their environment, drives them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's theory of the two factors.
Generally, two behaviors can emerge when a manager becomes the head of former colleagues, one of the ends of the spectrum being to try to stay “the right guy” (or the right girl).
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, take disciplinary action, conduct assessments, assign responsibilities, and hold others accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that he/she must change everything the group has created so far and do things in his/her own way.
After all, the boss is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local leadership.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member is accountable. It sets the standards for each of them.
Why would an organization want to impose the tedious process of creating a learning structure? One of the objectives related to the implementation of organizational concepts of learning is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively used in an organization’s functional services, creativity and ingenuity can be fully expressed.
Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the customer’s need.
Before an organization is innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and its own culture of learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve better results.
Neurobiological data provide material evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thus reducing the field of research and making it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of damage, lesions, tumors and brain trauma affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes never before seen.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our mind.
Although Artificial Intelligence is often heavily connoted science fiction, it represents a very important part of computer science that studies the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
Artificial intelligence research has as its object the automation by task machines requiring an intelligent approach.
Examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as the recognition of writing, voice and face.
These practices have led to distinct disciplines, focused on providing solutions to the problems of everyday life.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as it has been put into place in several home computer and video game software.
Excursions are an integral part of any school class. Quite often, a teacher would like to take his students to places where a bus trip is not conceivable.
The solution is brought by technology in the form of virtual educational outings.Students can look at the ancient objects of a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a superb work of art while sitting with their class.
Practically participating in an excursion is also a great way to think about a trip and share your experiences with future generations.
For example, students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website dedicated to their visit to the state capital each year. Each year, the site is updated, but older versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Even though students often try the blog experience with a neglected grammar and spelling, having an audience usually changes the situation.
As students are often the most critical audience, the author of the blog begins to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging “obliges students to get to know the world around them better.” The need to arouse public interest encourages students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
"When properly used, blogs ""can enable students to strengthen their analytical skills and critical mindset: by actively reacting to online content, they can confront their opinions with those of others and expose their own views on very specific topics"" (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and has a large number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south you will find Niagara Falls and to the north, the Muskoka area and its surroundings that have a virgin natural beauty.
All of these measures, and many more, make Ontario what foreigners regard as the quintessence of Canada.
Large areas further north are fairly sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited in the wild.
For a comparison of the population that surprises more than one: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the East African coast.
Madagascar is by far the largest country, and even a continent in its own right, in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known to be luxury resorts.
The Arabs also brought the practice of Islam into the lands and this religion spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama discovered the Cape road that connects Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any woman who travels say that she is married, regardless of marital status.
It is also advisable to wear an alliance (which should not seem too valuable.
Women need to realize that certain cultural differences can lead to behaviors that they consider to be harassment, because it is common for them to be followed, caught by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting male advances, and don’t be afraid to hold on (cultural differences or not, that doesn’t mean it’s acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber sinners in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese, who after destroying it had rebuilt it and named it Casa Branca, finally abandoned it in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name of Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading counters there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in all of Morocco to shop.
Around the old medina, you can easily find places where to buy traditional Moroccan products, such as tajines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and bibells of all kinds, but that's it for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the far east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano that buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside of Goma must be researched to understand the state of fighting that continues in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of the Nyiragongo volcano as well as for mountain gorilla tracking treks among the cheapest in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorbike taxi) to get around Goma. The normal price (local) is about 500 Congolese francs for a small race.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu has become a metaphor for distant and exotic countries.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stages of Henry Louis Gates' "Wonders of the African World" on PBS.
The city contrasts strongly with the cities of the rest of the country, because it has a more Arab than African style.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The total area of the park is 19,500 km2, it is divided into 14 ecozones, each housing a specific wildlife.
It is one of the most famous amusement parks in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily entry and conservation rights for the park.
It can be beneficial to get a Wild Card that gives access to some parks in South Africa, as well as all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the main center of interest for many tourists.
The row of buildings that draws the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a glittering bar chart, which is revealed by reflection in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To admire the most beautiful panoramas of Hong Kong, leave the island and join the Kowloon waterfront located opposite.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated on the landfills of the North Shore.
This is the place that British settlers have invested, so it seems to me to be a good starting point, if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this region.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching over 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not only composed of mangrove swamps: they also contain some of the last remnants of the majestic jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, about a third of which is covered by water/moor areas.
Sundarbans has been a nature reserve since 1966, where you can find about 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the interdistrict bus station (located on the other bank) throughout the day, but most, especially those serving the east and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6.30 a.m. and 7.30 a.m.
Inter-district buses are often full, so it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the districts are served by small Japanese caboteurs, who are comfortable and robust.
Collective taxis are a quick and comfortable way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock Bridge is a haubans bridge overlooking the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oyapoque to Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock to Guyana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters; it is 378 meters long and has two tracks 3,50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The structure was completed in August 2011, but it was only opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaran<0xC3><0xAD> were the largest indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also practicing subsistence agriculture.
Other indigenous tribes that inhabited the Chaco, such as the Guaycur<0xC3><0xBA> or Payagu<0xC3><0xA1>, survived mainly through fishing, hunting, or harvesting.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as “the giant province of India”, was born from the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous peoples.
The Spanish inaugurated the period of colonization, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunci<0xC3><0xB3>n in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its native character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and among the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Ca<0xC3><0xB1>itas.
In addition, tournaments and smaller matches are sometimes held here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, visit the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands Pound (FKP) whose value is equivalent to a pound sterling (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only island bank located in Stanley, in front of the FIC West store.
The pound sterling is a commonly accepted currency throughout the islands, while at Stanley, credit cards and U.S. dollars are also often accepted.
On nearby islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, although British and American currencies may be. Talk to the owners in advance to agree on a payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange money from the Falkland Islands outside the islands, so change it before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of Ecuador, winter in the northern hemisphere corresponds to summer there and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone and summer temperatures above 30°C are common.
Winter can be misleadingly cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but wind and humidity combine to give the impression that it is colder than what the thermometer says.
There are not really “rainy” and “dry” seasons: the rainfall is almost constant throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, these are wild species; please do not feed them or disturb them.
According to the park authorities, it is necessary to stay at least 100 meters from bears and wolves and 25 meters from all other wild animals!
As docile as they may seem, the bison, the squirrel, the moose, the bear and almost all the great animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they have not kept enough distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, know that odors attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid transporting or cooking fragrant food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval deadlock in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, with the exception of a British cruiser, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
Supreme Leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was assassinated during a peaceful rally held in the city, during the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement.
The beaches are numerous, as Auckland is riding on two ports. The most popular are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all beaches are sandy and allow you to swim safely, and most are shaded by pohutukawa.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located on Waitemata Harbour, in the chic suburbs of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in central Auckland.
These beaches, sometimes very frequented by families, have many shops along the coast. Swimming is safe there.
The main local beer is the "Number One", a fairly ordinary beer, but tasty and refreshing. There is also another local beer, the "Manta".
There are plenty of French wines to taste, but New Zealand and Australian wines may travel better.
You can drink local tap water safely, but you can easily find bottled water if you have concerns about it.
For Australians, the idea of a "cream coffee" is foreign. A short black is an "espresso", the cappuccino is filled with cream (no foam) and the tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate conforms to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries due to one of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all the signs and pay special attention to safety warnings.
From October to April, north of 1770, box jellyfish arrive near beaches and estuaries of rivers. They can also sometimes be seen outside this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans; most of them are afraid of humans and would stray from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their main habitat is in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind of knowing that he will have a place to sleep once he arrives at the destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but you can also book through travel agencies other types of accommodation, such as camping areas.
Travel agencies usually offer packages including breakfast, airport shuttle service, or even packages combining flight and accommodation.
They may also retain the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or get you other documents needed for your destination (for example, a visa).
However, any changes or requests must be addressed to the travel agency first and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants decide to camp on site, and most consider this to be an integral part of the experience.
If you want to participate closely in the musical event, you will have to arrive early to find a well-placed campsite.
Keep in mind that even if the musical performances are finished on the main stages, other musical performances can continue until late at night at other festival sites.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the North Baltic in winter, be sure to check the location of the hut, as crossing the ice can cause unbearable noises at the most exposed huts.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos generally make a lot of effort to maximize the time and money spent by customers. There are rarely windows and clocks, and exits can be difficult to spot.
They usually offer special offers of dishes, drinks and entertainment in order to maintain the good mood of the guests and keep them on site.
On some sites, it is the locals who offer free alcoholic beverages. Nevertheless, drunkenness alters the judgment, and all good players know that it is crucial to stay sober.
Anyone who drives at high latitudes or crosses mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or glacial temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you can’t drive like you’re on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, it can fall in a very short time enough snow to block you.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall or powdering or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, the presence of ice and snow is normal in many countries, and traffic is virtually uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most striking moment for many visitors.
In common usage, the term "safari" refers to an excursion to the African land, and especially the savannah, with the aim of attending the spectacle of wild animals in their midst.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars and the standard equipment allows them to be well observed.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called “bush walk”, “pedestrian safari” or “footing”) consists of hiking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, after hosting the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation in 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with typical tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Many hotels have irons and ironing boards that can be borrowed, even if there are no irons in the rooms.
If you don't have irons to iron or don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if you find one.
Avoid letting the fabric overheat (which can cause it to shrink or in extreme cases, burn it).
There are different methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some places it is enough to boil the water for a minute; in others it is necessary to do it for several minutes.
The efficiency of filters varies, and if you have a concern, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter noxious animals that they do not know in their home region.
Parasites can contaminate food, cause irritation or, in the most severe cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can hurt or kill people by force, are generally not considered parasites.
In some localities, duty-free shops offer an opportunity to purchase goods that are exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Travellers to countries where taxes are high can sometimes make significant savings, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages or tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often passing through isolated backcountry terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep an open mind: steep slopes, narrow lanes and tight curves predominate.
The speed limits displayed are significantly lower than in the previous and subsequent sections – usually from 35 to 40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and their strict observance is even more important than before.
On the other hand, the mobile service is curiously much stronger here than on many other parts of the road, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are very rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common: apples are cooked and cooked in pastries all year round, while cherries and plums point the end of their noses in summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes often pair particularly well with a cup of tight coffee.
If you want small but hearty pastries, try the balls of Berlin, also called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the regions.
A curry is a dish made of herbs and spices, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
A curry dish can be “solid” or “liquid”, depending on the amount of sauce it contains.

Indonesia with 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines present throughout the country.
However, when this term is used without any other qualifier, it tends to refer to foods from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a range of simply seasoned dishes, the predominant flavors that Javanese prefer are peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The handlebars are supports for the rider's feet, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the user, but they can pose a security problem: in fact, the user's feet can get stuck in it.
If a rider is thrown from a horse, but has a foot caught in the reel, he could be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a smooth and fairly narrow heel and sole.
Then, some saddles, especially the English ones, have safety bars that allow a stirrup to fall from the saddle if it is pulled backwards by a falling rider.
Cocham<0xC3><0xB3> Valley – The destination of excellence for climbing in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with many different large walls and granite cliffs.
From the top of the peaks, the panoramas of the mountains are breathtaking. Mountaineers from all over the world are constantly discovering new paths that can be walked on the slopes, where the possibilities are unlimited.
Downhill winter sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that consist of sliding down a snowy track with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity that has many aficionados, sometimes called “ski bums”, who organize their entire skiing holiday in specific places.
The idea of skiing is very old: rock paintings showing skiers date to some of 5000 BC!
The practice of alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century; the first recreational ski club was founded in 1861 in Australia by Norwegians.
Skiing: This activity is also called Nordic skiing, cross-country skiing or hiking skiing.
This is similar to alpine skiing, as well as mountaineering, but does not generally include these activities, which are practiced on rough terrain and which require the use of skis and boots much more rigid.
Think of the ski itinerary as a similar hiking route.
Under good conditions, you will be able to travel slightly larger distances than on foot – but you will very rarely reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on dammed slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries, so in conventional circumstances, traveling through several countries requires multiple visa applications and multiple passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, works a bit like a single country in this regard.
As long as you stay in this area, you can usually cross borders without going through passport checkpoints.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply separately for a visa for each of the member countries of the space, which saves time, money and administrative formalities.
There is no universal definition of whether a manufactured object is an antique, and some tax authorities define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
Criteria vary depending on where you are; in some parts of the world, such as North America, the age limit may be lower than in Europe.
Artisanal products can be considered antiques, even if they are less ancient than similar industrial products.
Reindeer farming is an important livelihood for the Sami and the culture surrounding this trade is of great importance to many other professions.
Although, according to tradition, not all Sami were involved in breeding large-scale reindeer, they lived on fishing, hunting and other similar activities, while using reindeer primarily as reindeer.
Today, many S<0xC3><0xA1>mi are engaged in modern trades, and tourism is an important source of income in Lapland, the S<0xC3><0xA1>mi region.

Travellers are strongly advised to inquire about the risks of bad weather that may affect their destination region, knowing that this may have an impact on the itineraries they are considering.
Anyone planning to travel to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive vocational training.
An online search for “Course in a hostile environment” is likely to provide the address of a local business.
A course will normally cover all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually with hands-on experience.
Training normally lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes training in gun handling.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wild are common, but publications dealing with war zones are few.
Travellers planning a sex change operation abroad must ensure that they have in their possession valid documents for their return trip.
Governments' willingness to issue unspecified gender (X) passports or documents updated to match the desired name and gender varies.

Preoperative transgender people should not expect to pass the scans while preserving their privacy and dignity.
Pull-out currents are currents that come back from waves that break on the beach, often on a trap or equivalent.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated on a few deeper sections, and a rapid flow to the deep waters can form there.
In most cases, the deaths are due to exhaustion resulting from an attempt to swim countercurrently, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, returning to swimming is no more difficult than usual.
Try to aim for a place where you will not be caught again. It is also possible that depending on your skills and whether you have been spotted or not, you may want to wait for help.
The reinsertion shock occurs earlier than the cultural shock (the honeymoon phase is less long), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travellers who have struggled to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it very difficult to adapt to their original culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and have lost some habits of your original culture.
At first, when you went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers to a new country had to adapt.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting attractions in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Usually, we always hear the noise of tourists and sellers. The history of sound and light is like a history book.
The Sphinx is placed as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the largest number of research stations and sixteen of them are active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The island of King George, with the village of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest.
Other examples include Livingston Island and Deception, where the caldera flooded by an active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, then reappear to form the Ellsworth Mountain Range, 360 km long and traversed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel chain, includes the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson massif, which culminates at 4892 m.
In remote locations without a cellular phone network, you may have no choice but to use satellite telephony.
A satellite phone usually does not replace a mobile phone, as you need to be outside and have an unobstructed view of the satellite to make a call.
It is a service often used by navigation, including pleasure craft, as well as by shipments that have remote data transmission and telephony needs.
Your local phone operator should be able to tell you more about connecting to this service.
Those who plan a sabbatical year have the opportunity to learn while traveling, and more and more of them choose this possibility.
This formula is especially appreciated by young people who leave school, as it allows them to take a year off before university, without compromising their studies.
Often, taking sabbatical year courses abroad can actually give you better chances of graduating in your country.
As a rule, registration fees are payable to follow these educational programs.
Finland is a destination of choice for boating and the "Country of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You do not necessarily need a yacht in the archipelagos and on the lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are actually large enough for a yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat for seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden and New Zealand are in the same situation, but apart from that, it is a unique case (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises are characterized by an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a few full days while returning to sleep on the boat at night.
If you only go ashore with cruise excursions, you will not need a separate visa (starting in 2009).
The city of Berlin, Germany, is mentioned in some brochures for cruises. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not at all located near the seaside and no visit to this city is included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or experienced a traumatic event.
We should not be ashamed of it: it is no different from the personal fears and fears that many people experience about other things.
For some, understanding something about how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or not having control.
Transport companies are well paid to make quick deliveries. Often, as part of an urgent repair, the question of time is crucial for the documents, goods or spare parts that relate to it.
On some roads, large companies have their own planes, but on other roads and for small businesses, there has been a problem.
If they had sent goods by air freight, on some routes, it would have taken days to pass the unloading and customs.
The only way to send it faster was to send it as checked baggage. Air regulations will not allow them to send luggage without a passenger, and that's where you intervene.
The most obvious way to travel in first class or business class is to spend a large sum of money on this privilege (or, even better, to ask your business to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economic rate for the business class, and eleven times for the first class!
In general, it is unnecessary to seek discounts for business class or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that they can rely on a certain type of traveller who are willing to pay very dearly for the privileges of speed and comfort, and they set their fares knowingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chi<0xC5><0x9F>in<0xC4><0x83>u. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that suffers from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, with its own government and its own currency, but recognized by no member country of the United Nations.
Economic ties have been restored between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of the political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.

Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not disfigure the site by marking or scratching graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understands it, and almost everyone is able to speak Spanish.
However, most of the panels are only in Catalan, as the law establishes that it is the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the subway are made only in Catalan, but unforeseen disruptions are announced by an automated system in many languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, rude and arrogant.

Most monasteries provide stoles to women who arrive without anything, but if you bring your own, and that in addition it bears bright colors, you will be entitled to a smile of the monk or nun at the entrance.
Just like men should wear pants covering the knees.
You can also borrow this garment in stock at the entrance, but as it is not washed after each use, you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all!

All names, followed by the word Sie which means you, always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is a great way to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
It can also be said that it makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to know whether a verb or an adjective is used in a substantivized form.
The pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written

However, those who speak a little Spanish might hastily conclude that Portuguese is close enough to it that it is not necessary to study it separately.
Premodern observatories are generally obsolete today, and remain in place as museums or educational sites.
As light pollution in their time was not as worrying as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge infrastructures placed in remote regions where atmospheric conditions are favorable.
The contemplation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where plum blossoms were the favorite flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor solely for himself and other members of the nearby aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants look their best when they are in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even “one” of them.
If you visit a strictly landscaped garden, the sampling of “specimens” will also get you expelled without discussion.
Singapore is generally considered an extremely safe place, where it is very easy to move around, and where you will be able to buy almost everything you need once you arrive on site.
But, located in the “high tropics” just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to adapt to the heat (always) and strong sunlight (when the sky is clear, which is rarer).
There are also some buses going north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.

The more traditional churches often organize an Easter vigil on Saturday evenings during the Easter weekend, with congregations often breaking into the feast at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that arrived on these islands did so originally by water, swimming or floating objects, or by air.
Due to the great distance that separates them from the mainland, the mammals could not get to the end of the trip, making the giant turtle the main pasture animal of the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you can discover the polar night, during which the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to admire the northern lights, as the sky will be dark almost all day.
Since the regions are sparsely populated, and therefore light pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners can be accustomed to.
Costumes are classic work outfits, and collaborators are called by their family name or by their function.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial because it focuses on collective effort rather than praising individual accomplishments.
