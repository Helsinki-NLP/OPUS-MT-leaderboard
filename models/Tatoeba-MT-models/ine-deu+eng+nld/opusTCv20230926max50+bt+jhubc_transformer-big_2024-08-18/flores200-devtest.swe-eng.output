The U.S. Gymnastics Association supports the letter of the U.S. Olympic Committee and agrees that it is imperative that the Olympic family promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC’s statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs can be better served if we proceed with a meaningful change to our organization, rather than if the certification is removed.

It not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but also provides details that fossils often cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
The researchers say that this animal's feather suit was chestnut-brown on the top, with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The findings also provide insight into the development of feathers in birds.
Since the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, the so-called coil, but on the other hand have other characteristics of feathers – rays and bitrawls – the researchers concluded that the coil was likely a later evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers indicates that they were not used for flying but instead for temperature regulation or for display. The researchers suggested that the specimen shows an adult feather suit and not chicken down, even if the tail comes from a young dinosaur.
The researchers said that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not young down.
A car bomb that detonated at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killed two police officers and injured more than 20 others.

They found that the sun worked according to the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all stars in the system was found to be driven by their brightness, their rotation, and nothing else.
With the help of brightness and rotation, the number of rosbytes of the star is determined, which has to do with the plasma flows.
The lower the rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic reversals.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made by the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by forces reminiscent of the tidal waters of the galaxy's dark matter and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts pulling force on the Earth, which causes tidal waves, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The researchers found that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter does.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located in a kind of halo, and is made up of lots of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the extremely drug-resistant form of tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said the new variant was "very worrying and alarming due to the very high mortality rate."
Some patients may have been infected by the bacterium in the hospital, Dr. Moll believes, of which at least two were hospital staff.
During the year, an infected person can transmit the infection to between 10 and 15 close contacts.
On the other hand, the proportion of XDR-TB in the whole group of people with tuberculosis still seems to be low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected at any given time in South Africa.

“Their thermal behavior is not as stable as large caverns on Earth that often maintain a relatively constant temperature, but it agrees that these are deep holes in the ground,” says Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey’s (USGS) team for astrogeology and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, the vote has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and put a printed sheet of paper with their chosen candidate in an envelope.
After officials have verified the identity of the voter, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting document.
French electoral law codifies the approach quite strictly.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added except those duly counted by the competent voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process. In the evening, the voices of volunteers who are under extensive supervision, and who follow specific procedures are counted.

Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Superintendent General D K Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile and laptop computer."
The accused are named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki announced that the accused were in court with their faces covered.
Despite the fact that three people were in the house when the car collided with it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the rescue service cut off the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrook Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court for murdering her son.
She is in custody pending prosecution and trial, but all eyewitness evidence may be worthless because her image has been widely published.
This is common elsewhere in the UK but Scottish law works differently and courts have considered the publication of photos as potentially harmful.
"Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University states that ""journalists choose a dangerous line if they publish photos etc. of suspects.""
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecution, has told reporters that no further comments will be made before prosecution.
According to the leak, the document deals with the border dispute, where the Palestinians want the borders to be based on them before the 1967 Six-Day War.
Other topics reported are the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a ten-year permanent military presence in the valley after a deal has been signed, while the PA only agrees to leave such a presence for five years.
Hunters in the complementary pest control experiment would be closely monitored by the park stewards, when the experiment was observed and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, volunteers were recruited, under the Sporting Shooters Associations hunting program.
According to Mick O’Flynn, Deputy Director of Park Conservation and Culture at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting mission received extensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly pledged a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members yesterday.
It is Martelly’s fifth provisional election council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former Provisional Electoral Council, as part of a package of measures to bring the country closer to new elections.
The Commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that started in October.
The partly violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have lapsed since 2011.
There have been reports of about 60 cases of overheating of faulty iPods, causing a total of six fires and causing four people minor burns.
Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (Meti) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the units.
METI announced last week that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "mild."
"The Department responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report ""very regrettable.""
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Office of the Northern Mariana Islands Rescue Service announced that no injuries have been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has held tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later switched places with an older lady because she was in need of toilet visits. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in his father’s footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland’s National Women’s Hospital in 1959.
While working in the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature births during his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was given, it would speed up the lung maturation of the fetus.
"Xinhua reported that government investigators carried two ""black boxes"" during Wednesday."
Some of my colleagues also praised Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said ""Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first boss. Luna died during the night with two moons. Pretty unique just like her. Strong woman.""
"Dustin ""Goldust"" Runnels said in a comment that ""Luna was as big a freak as I was...maybe even bigger...love her and will miss her...hopefully she's feeling better where she is now.""
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, the number opposed to Australia becoming a republic had grown by 8 percent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, Prime Minister Julia Gillard argued that Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of respondents to the survey share this view that Queen Elizabeth II will be Australia’s last last monarch.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist would have swimmed 100 m and 200 freestyle as well as three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his inconvenience, there have been doubts about his fitness.
He has not been able to take the medications needed to overcome his pain as they are banned in the competition.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest known prime number to date, on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery with various hardware and software at the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water resources on Earth, along with organic matter, which can form proteins and sustain life.
Since comets collided with Earth long ago, scientists hope to be able to understand how planets form, especially how Earth was formed.
Cuomo, 53, joined his government earlier this year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political plaster and trams."
It is speculated that he will run in the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would mean the plane flies shorter distances, saving millions of litres of fuel each year, and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, unlike older ground-based technologies, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is put in, and overland trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride stations are not available at ground level.
Fears of lack of means of transport opened up the possibility that the match would have to be played behind closed doors without the team’s supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Gal<0xC3><0xA1>pagos Islands.
Scientists from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University reported that the new species developed in just two generations, although this process is believed to have taken much longer due to breeding between the endemic Darwinfink, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant Espa<0xC3><0xB1>oladarwink, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn to thin wire that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
"It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted images in books called ""enlightened manuscripts""."
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The juice from the cabbage changes shade depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The PH value is shown by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (because hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Stir the two dry powders together, then form them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel funny and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet with flushing in almost every house, with a connection to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman society, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women lived together.
When you call someone hundreds of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space using the rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and field of view.
It takes a giant roof over 30 meters to get a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing that the wheel brought is to provide us with much simpler and faster methods of transport.
It has given us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including loose pets) that eat a much larger amount of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret behind their successes is the concept of a niche, a special job for each cat that keeps it away from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, and live in large groups called herds.
Herds consist of one to three related adult males along with as many as thirty females and young.
The females are often closely related to each other; a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lejob acts a lot like herds of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large cats) in behavior, and also very deadly for their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (but not well), swim, jump long distances and pull by five times the strength of a strong person.
The tiger is part of the same group (family Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the loud roar of the lion, but more like a meaning of roaring, screaming words.
Ozelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all animals that the ozelot hunts are much smaller than the one itself.
Scientists believe that ozelotes follow and find animals to eat (exchange) through the smell, by sniffing on the ground where they were.
They can see very well in the dark with dark vision and also move very sneaky. Ocelots hunt their prey by melting into their surroundings and then throwing themselves over the prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small stock) is separated from the main stock from which they originate (for example, if they move across a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily recover) they often end up in a different environment than the one in which they were previously found.
This new environment has other resources and other competitors, so to be a strong competitor, the new population needs different functions or adaptations than they previously needed.
The indigenous populations have not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they begin to look smaller and smaller than the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe and they absorb carbon dioxide that people emit (i.e. breathe out).
Plants produce food using sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses of plants and manufacture our clothes of plants. Much of the food we eat is plants. Without the plants, the animals cannot survive.
The Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain during its time, so it had nothing to be afraid of, except for other Mosasaurs.
The long jaws were obsessed with more than 70 knife-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the gum, meaning there was no chance of escaping from anything that crossed its path.
We do not know for sure, but it may have had a cleft tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been cannibal.
It also attacked everything that came down in the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex was no match for it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual festive features such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a kind of rodent called a hazelnut.
Another difference was that while the poor people and the woman ate their food while sitting in chairs, the rich men liked to have banquets together where they could lay halfway on the side while they ate their meals.
Ancient Roman meals may not have contained food that came to Europe from America or from Asia in recent centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no cocoa, no potatoes, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods who were considered to be the home of the god.
People took offerings to the gods and the priests tried to appease the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary to which only the priests had access.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziqqurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special refuge for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family took place outside.
Women cooked on the farm; shops were just open trays facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Nordic legends it is said that Erik the Red was expelled from Iceland as a punishment for murder, and that when he traveled west he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Whatever his discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at the time.
"Although each country was ""Scandinavian"" there were many differences between the peoples, the kings, the customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland."
If you’ve seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there’s a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Even if there is something on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence the words ""Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776"" were written." The text appears on the underside of the document, up and down."
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but we know that the large parchment (measured 75.6 cm x 62.2 cm) was rolled together for storage early in its existence.
So it is likely that the text was only written there as a label.
The landings on D-Day and the subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
"It was run by the Vichy French, French people who came to terms with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them."
"On August 15, 1940, the Allied invasion of southern France, the invasion was called Operation Dragon."
In just two weeks, the Americans and the free French forces had liberated southern France and turned against Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a significant large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning citizens, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and which also defines in some way the size of society.
Urban states are the forerunners of nations. A civilized culture means the transfer of knowledge between several generations, a tarnished cultural footprint and a fair spread.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces, and are not recognized as real civilizations.
During the American War of Independence, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—with Congress as the sole component—according to the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked all the power to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive power or judiciary, it fell to the authorities of the states, who were often unwilling to cooperate, to implement all its decisions.
Nor did it have the authority to abolish tax laws and customs between states.
The articles required unanimous approval from all the states before they could be added and the states attached so little weight to the central government that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football, together with the German football team, is the world's second most successful team and was the champion of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller skating and Formula 1.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
With its many islands, Japan in a geographical sense is often considered an archipelago.
Taiwan’s history dates back to the 15th century when European sailors who passed by registered the island’s name as Ilha Formosa, which means beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation of the original production of grain and employing Chinese workers to work on the rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 Taiwan was declared a province by the Qing Empire.
After the 1895 defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty, by which sovereignty over Taiwan was given to Japan, which then ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, the Intihuatana, the Sun Temple and the Temple with the three windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they looked like in the original.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still manufactured today, but even more important is its image ratio inherited from the formats of photo sensors in digital cameras.
The 35mm format is, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
Therefore, the aspect ratio in this format (dividing by twelve to achieve the simplest integer relationship) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS format) match this image ratio or are close to it.
The highly abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while keeping a certain order in an image.
It is argued that the best location for the subject is where the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally meet (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was examined.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had united European states despite their differences in language and customs.
Its ubiquitous power affected everyone from king to common man.
One of the main doctrines of Christianity says that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church’s funds are for that very purpose.
The central power of the Church had resided in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether this principle was fulfilled.
Shortly after the conflict broke out, Britain began a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective in cutting off necessary military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in most international agreements over the past two hundred years.
Britain mined international waters to prevent all ships from crossing entire areas of the sea, making it risky even for neutral ships.
Given the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited underwater warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitude was pacifism and isolation among most inhabitants and countries.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, countries wanted to avoid such a situation being repeated in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with four cents in his pocket, a poetry book and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of distinguishing different time periods; each stage in China’s history, or each family in power, was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty there was also an unstable period in which the provinces were divided. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms, which took place between the 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, violent warfare often took place between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The three kingdoms were one of the bloodiest times in ancient China's history when thousands of people died in battle to sit in the highest chair of the Great Palace of Xi'an.
There were many social and political effects such as the use of the meter system, a transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not a single ruler.
Furthermore, the professions were opened up to all men seeking, which allowed the most ambitious and successful to discover successes.
The same applies to the military, when rank within the army was now based on caliber rather than on class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to make a revolution.
"Muhammad was deeply interested in subjects beyond his everyday life. He used to visit a cave that became known as ""Hira"" on ""Noor"" mountain (light) to consider."
The cave itself, which survived the passage of time, gives a very clear picture of Mohammed’s spiritual tendencies.
The cave, located on one of the mountain peaks north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find even if you know it exists. Inside the cave there is total isolation.
You can see nothing but the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exist today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Cheops Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor dead pharaohs.
The Giza Necropolis, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of Death, contains several pyramids (of which the great pyramid is the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Cheops pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
"The ""up-stroke"" marking looks like a V and the ""down-stroke"" marking looks like a bracket or a square that lacks the bottom side."
Up means you should start at the tip and press the bar upwards, and down means you should start at the frog (where your hand holds the bar) and pull the bar downwards.
A stride usually generates a softer sound, while a downstroke is stronger and more resolute.
You are welcome to draw your own markings, but keep in mind that the printed stripe markings are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
The insane King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame <0xC3><0x89>lisabeth, were forced back to Paris on October 6, 1789 from Versailles by a swarm of merchant women.
They traveled back to Paris in a wagon surrounded by a mob screaming and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep their carriage windows open at the fork.
On one occasion, one of the participants in the mob swung the head of an imperial guard killed at Versailles, in front of the frightened queen.
The war expenses for the conquest of the Philippines by American imperialism were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover most of the cost and interest on bonds in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the great gains derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of American imperialism.
To understand the masters of the temple, one must understand the context that led to the creation of order.
The period when the events took place is often called the High Middle Ages period of European history during the 11th century to the 14th century.
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Old Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which formally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses many different ideas in practice, from technology driving development or the technological imperative in the strict notion that man’s destiny is driven by a basic logic related to the laws of nature and how they manifest in technology.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas in common: that technology itself follows a path that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has ""effects"" on societies that are original, rather than socially conditioned."
One could say, for example, that the motor-powered car inevitably leads to the construction of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically sustainable for just a small amount of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass ownership of cars also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, leading to the invention of new technologies in healthcare to repair damaged bodies.
Romance contained a large element of determinism originating from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romance, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture related to this geography emerged, and these, which harmonized with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily enacted laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the feudal fashion capital of Europe.
Its reputation as an epicentre of luxury began to circulate around 400 A.D. and continued until around 1100 A.D.
Its influence diminished in the 14th century mainly due to the fact that crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were valued higher than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its climax between the 12th and 13th centuries.
In the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slow communication routes, the styles of the West could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time as a result of the Crusades was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Self-sustaining agriculture is agriculture carried out for the production of sufficient food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family only.
Self-contained farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses stored seeds originating in the ecoregion combined with alternate farming or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers operated self-sustaining agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by society and allow them to find their identity.
Subcultures may be distinct due to their age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender.
The characteristics that determine a subculture as distinct may be of a linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical nature, or it may be a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through a distinctive and symbolic style choice, which includes fashion, manner, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to look at the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, accident or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their upbringing.
"Such children are called ""wild"". Some wild children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to the parents rejecting a child's serious intellectual or physical disabilities."
Wild children may have experienced serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or moved.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wilderness on their own.
When the wild child is reared entirely by non-human animals, it exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost completely identical to that of the specific care animal, such as its fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, supportive teaching goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a support for individuals learning something new, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of support, but it’s also the little gem-man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support is internalized in the software and is intended to question, guide and explain methods that may have been too challenging for the student to cope with themselves.
Children are placed in foster homes for a variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, or educational, but it does happen.
We believe that the foster home system is a safe zone for these children.
Our family home system will provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable healthcare.
Fosterhome is there to offer all the necessities that were missing in the home they previously came from.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The Internet’s distinctive character traits lead to additional dimensions in terms of user theory.
"For example, ""learning"" and ""socialization"" are proposed as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995)."
"Even ""personal engagement"" and ""continuous relationships""" were identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when investigating audience reactions to websites."
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial expressions lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can determine whether a person is lying by interpreting microexpressions correctly.
"Oliver Sacks showed in his writing ""President's Speech"" how people who can't understand speech due to brain injury can still judge sincerity correctly."
He even claims that we share such knowledge in interpreting human behavior with animals such as domesticated dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two areas of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of pronounced variation.
Segregation and recombination shift variations back and forth between the two poles for each new generation.
Out on the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like the human to satisfy its need for amino acids from the plants that are available.
In addition, a lack of this has serious consequences; inhibited growth, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
By comparison, animal food (amphibians, termites, eggs) is not only easily digested, but also offers high-quality proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
“After all, we shouldn’t be surprised if our own ancestors solved their ‘protein problem’ in much the same way chimpanzees on the savannah do today.”
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10–60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that brings you closer to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you usually turn off the clock in your sleep, you can set it on the other end of the room, so you have to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking lots of fluids (especially water or tea, a known fluid driver) before going to sleep, which means you have to get up and pee.
The amount of inner peace a person has correlates opposite to the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive the present life force. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has expanded with the path of love within the Mahayana and many techniques within Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
With kundalini yoga, the kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Through the visualization of different gods, the energy channels are purified, the chakras activated and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. When the war ended, differences in systems, processes and culture led to the co-operation of the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be physically fought by contract armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian frontiers, having invaded the eastern regions of Poland and at the same time violated the bilateral peace agreement in Riga, both the non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Poland.
By far the most efficient way of transporting large numbers of people and goods across the seas is to use ships to transport goods.
The task of the fleets has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods, while disrupting the enemy’s ability to move people and goods.
One of the most notable sentient examples was the North Atlantic Campaign during World War II. The Americans tried to move troops and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet, mainly with the help of submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain in the same way as the rest of Europe.
Getters appear to have been domesticated only about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes had them to get milk, fur, meat and skin.
Tamgetts were usually kept in shovels that walked on hills or other pastures, often picked by shepherds who were often children or adolescents, similar to the more well-known sheep herd. These methods of picking are still used today.
Tramways for carriages were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although carriageways consisted only of parallel wooden planks, the horses that pulled them allowed them to achieve higher speeds and draw greater loads than on the then slightly coarser roads.
Slippers were introduced quite early to keep the tracks in place. However, it was gradually realized that the tracks would be more effective if they had a layer of iron on top.
This became practice, but the iron tore more on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. The first rails entirely made of iron were introduced in 1767.
The first known mode of transport was walking, people started walking upright two million years ago when Homo erectus (meaning the upright man) saw the light of day.
Their predecessor, australopithecus, was not used to walking upright.
Bipedal specializations have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can engage in the environmental movement, and we can also become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is in many cases as a symptomatic treatment. But if we do not just want a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is very clear that the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological progress of humanity, and the problems have been exacerbated by overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
After it had been adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon on the farm in Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read out to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 of Dunlap's wide pages that are known to still exist are the oldest preserved copies of the document. The handwritten original has not been preserved.
Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and remain to this day. We call them birds.
Many do not think of them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things in birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and chlorine, they lay eggs and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1 and these numbers are called binary numbers - or bits to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning is not always immediately noticeable. Symptoms such as vomiting are too common for an immediate diagnosis to be made.
The best sign of poisoning can be an open can of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
The term berries is used in the formal sense by entomologists for this group of insects.
This term derives from ancient kinships with wall lice, insects that are sharply adapted to parasitize on humans.
Both predatory snails and wall snails are resident, adapted to live in its host's home or dwelling.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their interest, or is for the good of their children, to raise a child.
These couples may choose to establish an adoption plan for their child.
During an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method is indicative in almost all research.
Experimenting, where an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, to ask questions and make observations, also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle’s view on all scientific issues, including psychology, was accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the Western world found itself cut off from its Greek roots in philosophy and science.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms that are not just reactions to external periodic signals have been documented in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
A biological clock is a self-propelled oscillator that repeats its cycle for a period of time even in the absence of external influence.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to plant their own DNA in a bacterium.
They did two experiments that marked either DNA in the substance with a radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the substance with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are sex cells.
Only mutations in reproductive cells can be inherited to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting nature areas for the purpose of experiencing the landscape, including its plant and animal life.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, as well as visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
One example is to visit, photograph and learn more about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small towns in cars to go to their jobs and are passed by others whose destination for work is the place they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle traffic, everyone is in some way interconnected with, and supports, a transport system based on private cars.
Science now shows that this massive coleconomy has disrupted the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human development over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. In principle, everyone complains about transport systems.
In inland countries, similar complaints about water quality or collapsed bridges are rarely heard.
Why do transport systems generate so many complaints, why do they fall on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of how individual drivers and vehicles move between two points and how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows because driver behaviour cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
As well, drivers tend to behave appropriately consistently; thus, traffic tends to float on somewhat consistently and can be presented mathematically in large measure.
To better represent traffic flow, three main variables have been identified: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These conditions are helpful in the planning, design and operation of facilities along the roads.
The insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid the enemy more easily and to find food and partners more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
This gives them more small spaces where they can hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can’t curl their wings are the wizarding fairies and day fairies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right but many believed the opposite; that the solar system was moving around the earth, including the sun (and also the other stars).
This seems reasonable, because it doesn’t feel like the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the world’s most aquatic and second longest river. Its water flow is more than 8 times as large as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, 9 km wide in some places.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from Earth’s rivers comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River's main ravine is 6,387 km. It gets its water gets thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the stone pyramid construction continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza's size and construction technology were never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the new kingdom were amazed at the monuments of their predecessors, which at that time were well over a thousand years old.
The Vatican City State has about 800 inhabitants; it is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
The Vatican State uses Italian in its legislation and in official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used at religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
Humans have known basic chemical substances such as gold, silver and copper since antiquity, as these can be discovered in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had a theory that everything consisted of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four phases of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he had theories that they switch to new substances to create what we see.
Alloys are a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that there are many different elements in the periodic table.
Substances such as calcium and potassium are counted as metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic substances such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them can fit into the point at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a faithful companion for many people when it came out.
Once newer writing methods have been developed, unfortunately, the pencil has been given a lower status and fewer uses.
Today, people write messages on computer screens, and never need to get close to a pencil sharpener.
You can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes.
The fission bomb is based on the principle that it takes energy to produce a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like rolling a heavy cart up a hill, squeezing the core again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, so it doesn’t take much for them to decay.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the right side and 100 km thick on the left side.
It is thinner under the moon and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more maria on the nearby side because the crust is thinner there. This made it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories revolve around finding out what gets people going or what appeals to them.
The theories argue that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized after they become adults.
These theories look at what makes some people want what they want and what in their environment makes them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
"Generally speaking, two behaviors can occur when bosses begin to lead their former guilds. At one end of the spectrum, the boss tries to remain ""one in the gang"""."
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, you become an unrecognizable person who feels that he or she must change everything that the team has done and make it his own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for whether the team succeeds or fails.
This behavior often results in gaps between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams maintain the same high standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members tend to act as a point of contact for the physical group.
They often have more to say about than conventional team members as different time zones can influence when their team can meet and this may not be understood by management locally.
"The presence of a real ""invisible team"" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team."
"The ""invisible team"" is the management group to which all members report. The invisible team sets the standards for each member."
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization? One goal of starting using organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in an organization’s functional departments, creativity and ingenuity can flourish.
Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that meets the customer’s needs.
Before an organization can innovate, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuum approach as a method used to support organizations in achieving a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological information provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Therefore, it makes the research area narrower and much more accurate.
The correlation between brain diseases and behavior supports researchers in their research.
It has long been known that various brain injuries, traumas, diseases and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technology allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that we have not seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science that involves machine behavior, learning, and intelligence.
AI research is about getting machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this are control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, and also recognition of hand style, voice and face.
Such things have become separate disciplines, which focus on offering solutions to real problems.
The AI system is now widely used in finance, medicine, technology and the military, and has been built into multiple home computers and video game software applications.
Field studies are a big part of the teaching in each class. Often the teacher wants to take the students to places where there are no buses.
The technology offers solutions with virtual study visits. Students can look at museum objects, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art sitting with their class.
Sharing a study trip virtually is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital; the website is made every year, but previous versions may remain online as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. Students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of readers improves this in general.
Since students are often the most critical readers, the blogger tries to write better to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging "forces students to become more aware of the outside world." The requirement to cater to the interest of readers stimulates students to be skeptical and interested (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
"Adequate use of blogs can give students the opportunity to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to internet material, students can define their positions in relation to what others have written, as well as account for their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada’s charming bilingual capital and offers a range of galleries and museums that showcase Canada’s present and past.
Further south are the Niagara Falls and in the northern part is the beautiful, untouched nature of Muskoka.
All this and more, Ontario excels with what outsiders consider to be the quintessence of Canada.
Large areas further north are very sparsely populated, and some are near enough uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent of its own in terms of fauna.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or belong to France, and are known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam to the areas, which had a major impact in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century after the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama rounded the Godahoppsudden and thus found the sea route from Europe to India.
The region borders the Sahel in the north and the Atlantic in the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also good to wear a ring (not just one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can result in what they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon for someone to follow one, grab one’s arm, etc.
Be determined when you say no to men and don’t be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences don’t make it okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 11th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port named Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca. only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city of Daru l-Badya, which was named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tagine, ceramics, leather products, water pipes and a full spectrum of crime scenes, but that’s all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located very far east near the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the volcano Nyiragongo, which buried most of the city's streets, especially in the central parts.
Goma is quite safe, but if you want to visit outside of Goma, you should investigate what it looks like with the fighting in the northern Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the volcano Nyiragongo along with some of the cheapest tracks of mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use the boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price for the short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
"Combined with its relative inaccessibility, ""Timbuktu"" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, remote places."
Today Timbuktu is a poor city, but its reputation makes it a tourist destination, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered world heritage sites due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the major stops during the Henry Louis Gates PBS program Wonders of the African world.
The city stands in stark contrast to the other cities of the country, with an atmosphere that is Arabic rather than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, while the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which houses different wildlife.
It is one of the largest attractions in South Africa and is considered to be the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Just like all other South African national parks, the park charges daily conservation and entrance fees.
It can also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which provides access to either a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives Hong Kong’s territory its name and is the place that many tourists consider as the main focus.
The buildings in a row constituting Hong Kong’s silhouette have been likened to a glittering bar chart reinforced by the water in Victoria’s harbor.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to Kowloon's seaside opposite.
The vast majority of the settlement on Hong Kong Island is tightly packed on the former seabed along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists took over, so if you’re looking for evidence of the area’s colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world and stretches 80 km into Bangladesh and the Indian hinterland from the coast.
Sundarbans National Park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site located on Indian territory and is also known as Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only mangrove-growing —they contain some of the last remaining sites of the great jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
Sundarban covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third is wetland.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife reserve, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 axe deer in the area.
Buses depart from the district communal bus station (over the river) all day, but most, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, run between 6.30 and 7.30.
Since buses between the districts are often full, it is a good advice to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Now) and Punakha (200 Now).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable bridge that runs across the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise 83 meters up, it is 378 meters long and has two corridors that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical free height under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened for traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs stations are expected to be completed.
Guaran<0xC3><0xAD> was the most significant indigenous group that inhabited present-day eastern Paraguay and lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was populated by other groups of indigenous tribes such as Guaycur<0xC3><0xBA> and Payagu<0xC3><0xA1>, who lived as hunters, collectors and fishermen.
"In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called ""India's Giant Province""", was born as a result of the meeting between the Spanish conquerors and groups of the indigenous people. "
The Spanish began the period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since Asunci<0xC3><0xB3>n was founded in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its native character and identity.
Argentina is well known for their polo teams and players being among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Las Ca<0xC3><0xB1>itas polo courts.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For tournament news and where to buy tickets for polo matches please contact Asociacion Argentina de polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP) whose value corresponds to the value of a British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
GBP is generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and within Stanley it is often good to pay by credit card and USD.
Credit cards will probably not be accepted on the remote islands, but UK and US currency can be accepted; contact the owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; during the summer months it is common with temperatures above +30°C
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature rarely drops below zero, but the wind and humidity combine and make it feel colder than the thermometer says.
"There are no special 'rainy' and 'dry' seasons: the amount of rain remains roughly the same throughout the year."
Despite the fact that many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, you should stay at least 100 meters from bears and wolves and 25 meters from all other wild animals!
No matter how agile they look, bisonoxes, moose, kandai deer, bears and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they did not keep adequate distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Also, keep in mind that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking food that smells and keep the camp clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a notorious deadlock in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom refused to leave the port.
All ships sank, except one British cruiser, nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the city led to the assassination of Supreme Commander Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches due to Auckland’s location between two ports. The most popular beaches are divided into three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and on most, the M<0xC4><0x81>ori myrtle offers shade.
Tamaki Drive’s beaches are located at Waitemata Harbour, in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes well-visited family beaches with a good selection of shops located on the beach. Swimming is safe.
"The main local beer is ""Number one"", which is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called ""Manta""."
There are many French wines, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be better off.
The local drinking water is completely risk-free to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you’re worried.
"For Australians, the idea of "flat white" coffee is unknown. A ""short black"" is ""espresso"", cappuccino has a pile of cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk."
The hot chocolate milk meets Belgian standard. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
There are many trips to the reef all year round and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Still, take the advice of the authorities, listen to all the signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Cubic mannetes occur near beaches and near river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can sometimes also be found at other times.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and would swim away.
The saltwater crocodile's main habitat is in the estuaries north of Rockhampton, so they usually do not live in the ocean.
Booking in advance gives the traveler security and a guarantee that they will have somewhere to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but it may be possible to book other types of accommodations, such as campsites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast, transfers to and from the airport, and even package trips that combine flights and hotels.
They may also reserve your booking for you if you need time to think about the offer or provide additional documents required for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, all changes and requests must go through the travel agency first, and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival visitors decide to camp on site, and most visitors see it as an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to where things happen, you need to come early to get a campsite close to the music.
Remember that even if the music performances on the main stage have stopped, parts of the festival can continue to play music until late at night.
Some festivals have special campsites for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as walking through the ice causes really terrible noises for those who are most affected.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see terms and conditions).
Casinos usually do everything they can to get guests to spend as much time and money as possible. There are often no windows or clocks, and the exits are often difficult to find.
They usually have special offers on food, drink and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and get them to stay in the premises.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages for free. But intoxication worsens the judgment, and all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who is to drive at high latitudes or above mountain passes should be aware that snow, ice and temperatures below the freezing point may occur.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low and you cannot drive in the same way as on bar asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall in a very short time for you to get stuck.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall or snowfall or by condensation or ice on the vehicle’s windows.
On the other hand, frigid and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues largely uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the largest tourism industry in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in popular use refers to trips across the country to see the amazing African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars and with standard equipment it is possible to see them well.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shaded and can be seen better with binoculars.
"Walking safari (also called ""bush walk"" and ""hiking safari"") consists of walking either for a few hours or for several days."
The Paralympics will take place between August 24 and September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations around Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted two Summer Olympics, as it hosted the 1964 Games.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the departure was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies due to the coronavirus look different, but by the end of March, most do not extend as far as July 2020, when the Olympic Games would have begun.
It is expected that most tickets to events will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with a typical ticket price around 7,000 yen.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that can be borrowed, even if it is not in the room.
If no iron is available, or if you do not want to wear stretched socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if one is available.
Be vigilant and do not let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage or in extreme cases sweating).
There are different sets to clean water on, and some are more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas it is enough to boil the water for one minute, in others it takes several minutes.
Filters can vary in efficiency, and if you are unsure then you should consider buying your water in a closed bottle from an established company.
Travelers may encounter pests they are not familiar with from their home regions.
Pests can destroy food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people by force, are usually not classified as pests.
Tax-free shopping is the ability to buy goods without taxes or other surcharges in certain places.
Travelers on their way to high-tax countries can sometimes save a significant amount, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The line between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which often runs through isolated native forest terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, drive with reason: steep inclines, narrow lanes and transverse curves are common.
Set speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections - usually 56-64 km/h (35-40 mph) - and that they are followed is even more important than otherwise.
Strangely enough, mobile coverage is much better here than along many other stretches, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are really good, and in Bavaria they are quite powerful and varied, similar to those from the neighbor in the south, Austria.
Pastries with fruit are common, with apples baked in pastries year-round as well as cherries and plums during the summer.
Many German pastries also have almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes often fit particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but powerful pastries, you can try what depending on the region is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
"A curry can be either ""dry"" or ""moist"" depending on the amount of liquid."
In northern India and Pakistan's inland regions, yogurt is often used in curry dishes; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a gathering name that includes a wide variety of regional dishes scattered around the country.
However, if used without a definite word, the term tends to mean the food that originally came from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, now available throughout the archipelago, offers an array of simply spicy dishes, where the flavors that the Javanese use most are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Stigbygs are support for the rider's feet that hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but can pose a safety risk as the rider’s feet may get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown by a horse but has been trapped with a foot in the bar, he can be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
First, most riders have boots with heels and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety rods that ensure that a riser bar loosens from the saddle if pulled backwards by a falling rider.
The Cocham<0xC3><0xB3> Valley, Chile’s top destination for climbing, is known as South America’s Yosemite, and has a number of large cliffs and granite walls.
The mountain peaks offer breathtaking views. Climbers from all corners of the world are constantly creating new routes among the countless mountain walls.
Cross-country skiing, which includes skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports where you can slide down a snowy landscape with skis or a snowboard tied at your feet.
Skiing is an activity that attracts many enthusiasts, sometimes called "skiers", who plan the entire holiday trip around skiing in a certain area.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers date as far back as 5,000 BC!
Skating as a sport has existed since at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: this activity is also called backcountry skiing, hiking or skiing.
It is related to but usually does not involve alpine skiing or mountain climbing, the latter is carried out in steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as on a similar hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you will be able to handle a slightly larger distance than walking – but you rarely get up at speeds such as cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack in prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries; under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport checks on multiple occasions.
The Schengen area, however, functions somewhat like a country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross borders without undergoing passport checks multiple times.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa in each Schengen Member State separately, thus saving you both time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured objects are antiques. Some tax offices define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where age limits may be shorter in, for example, North America than in Europe.
Craft products can be defined as antiques, although they are not as old as similar mass-produced goods.
Cleansing is an important livelihood among the Sami people and the culture surrounding trade is also important for many with other professions.
Historically, however, not all S<0xC3><0xA1>mi have been involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but have lived by fishing, hunting and the like and used the reindeer mostly as draggers.
Today, many Sami people work in modern industries. Tourism is an important source of income in S<0xC3><0xA1>pmi, the Sami territory.
"Although it is often used, especially among non-Romanesques, the word 'gypsy' is often considered offensive because of its associations with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about Romanesques."
If the country you are visiting becomes subject to a travel restriction, your travel health insurance or your cancellation protection may be affected.
You may also have requests to consult governments other than your own, but their advice is designed for their own residents.
For example, for U.S. citizens in the Middle East, there may be other circumstances than Europeans or Arabs.
A travel advice is just a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The image presented is often fast, general and simplified compared to the more detailed information available from elsewhere.
Extreme weather is the general term for all dangerous weather phenomena with the potential to cause harm, serious social disruption or the loss of human life.
Difficult weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different variations of them, which can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy precipitation and runaways are types and consequences of extreme weather, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, cloud cover and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include severe snowstorms, thunderstorms, ice storms and sandstorms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of the risk of severe weather affecting their area, as it may affect their itinerary.
Anyone planning to visit a country that can be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
"A search on the Internet for ""hostile environmental education"" will probably give the address to a local company."
A course usually goes through all of the issues mentioned here in much more detail, usually with practical exercises.
A course usually lasts between 2-5 days and includes role-playing, very first aid, and sometimes gun training.
There are plenty of books on how to survive in the wilderness, while books about war zones are rare.
Travelers planning a sex-correcting operation abroad must ensure that they hold valid documents for their return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without gender (X) or documents that are updated to match a desired name or gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents varies just as much.
Security checks have also become significantly more intrusive in the post-11 September 2001 era.
Transgender persons who have not undergone an operation shall not expect to be able to pass the X-ray check with integrity and dignity in place.
Rip currents are the return flow from waves that break off at the beach, often at a reef or the like.
The topology underwater allows the reflux to be concentrated to a few deeper parts, and strong currents leading to deep water can form there.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion after trying to swim back in the opposite direction, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the stream, it’s no harder than normal to swim back.
Try to aim somewhere where you don’t get stuck again or, depending on your skills and whether you’ve been discovered, wait to be rescued.
The return shock comes earlier than the cultural shock (there is not as much of a honeymoon phase), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have had an easy time adapting to new cultures sometimes find it difficult to re-adjust to their original culture.
Upon returning from abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of the habits of your home culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, because of the knowledge that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
People may not expect that patience and understanding is also necessary for travelers returning home.
The Pyramids Sound and Light Show is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the performance begins.
Usually you always hear the sounds of tourists and vendors. The sound and light story is just like a storybook.
The background is the Sphinx, which tells a long story.
The scenes appear on the pyramids, and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries, and they have the most bases, of which sixteen are active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with the community of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception where the flooded crater of an active volcano forms a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth's land is the region south of the peninsula, and borders the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula’s mountains merge here with the plateau and then return to form the 360 km long Ellsworth mountain range, which is shared by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range has Antarctica's highest mountain, the Vinson Massif, with a highest peak of 4892 m in Mount Vinson.
In remote locations without mobile coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone generally does not replace a mobile phone, as you have to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite in order to make a call.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions that need remote data and voices.
Your local telecommunications operator should be able to provide you with more information on how to connect to this service.
Traveling and learning is an increasingly popular option for those planning a free year.
This is particularly popular among recent graduates, allowing them to take a year off before university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a sabbatical course abroad can actually increase your chances of getting into a higher education in your home country.
Usually, a fee is charged to register for these programs.
Finland is very boat-friendly. The land of the thousand lakes also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the archipelagos.
In the archipelago and lakes you do not necessarily need a yacht.
Although the archipelagos and the largest lakes are really big enough for any pleasure hunt, smaller boats or even a kayak can offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat in every seventh or eighth person.
This is matched by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Most of the specifically Baltic cruises include a longer stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a couple of weekends while returning to and sleeping on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore with boat excursions, you do not need a separate visa (from 2009).
Some cruises include the German capital Berlin in its brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by air can be a daunting experience for people, regardless of age and background, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal fear and reluctance of other things that very many people have.
Understanding how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help some people overcome a fear that is due to discomfort in the face of the unknown or lack of control.
Courier companies have paid well to deliver things quickly. Often time is very important when it comes to business documents, merchandise or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own aircraft, but for other routes and smaller companies there was a problem.
If they have shipped things by air freight, on some routes it may have taken several days to go through unloading and customs.
The only way to get it out faster was to send it as checked baggage. The airline's rules do not allow you to send luggage without a passenger, and this is where you get into the picture.
The obvious way to fly in first class or business class is to punch out with a whole lot of money for the privilege (or better yet, let your company do it for you).
However, this does not come at a cheap price: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy price for business and eleven times for first class!
In general, there is no point even looking for discounts for business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of travelers who are willing to pay well for the privilege of traveling somewhere quickly and conveniently. The companies also charge thereafter.
The capital of Moldova is Chi<0xC5><0x9F>in<0xC4><0x83>u. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is common.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has been affected by ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but which is not recognized by any of the UN member states.
Economic relations have been restored between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failures of the political negotiations.
The largest religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
<0xC4><0xB0>zmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transport hub.
The city, which in historical times was called Smyrna, is today a modern, developed city and a lively commercial center located at a huge harbor surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping malls are mixed with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market and ancient mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere that is more like Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsv<0xC3><0xAD>k offers a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy, and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery there are interesting marble statues of doves over part of the tombs.
It's worth wandering around for half an hour in the captivating village.
Within reach to the north is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners after a shimmering account of its magnificence by Lord Byron.
Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
In the north, also visit the amazing Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (sanctuary), a place world famous for the revelations of Mary.
Remember that you are actually visiting a mass grave site and a place that has an almost insurmountable significance for a significant part of the world’s population.
There are still many men and women in life who survived their time here, and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or worked here; Jews as well as non-Jews.
Use the site with the great dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not vandalize the site by painting or scratching graffiti on structures.
Barcelona’s official language is Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, an overwhelming majority understands it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, as it is by law the primary official language.
However, Spanish is also used in many places in public transport and other institutions.
Common messages in the subway are made only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are communicated by an automated system in a variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, rude and arrogant.
"Although this is often just a wrong stereotype, the best way to get through Paris is still to behave in the best way and behave like someone who is ""bien levé"" (well-bred). It will make it much easier to get around."
The freckles of the Parisians will quickly disappear if you show yourself from your cunning side.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is cultivated with dense forests, the main grove with beech, spruce and spruce, and has a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a strikingly high species richness, due to the extent of the microclimate, different soil moons and varying elevation differences.
The area is also home to an extreme diversity of animal and bird species.
Rare animal species such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, locust, wild cat and teddy are found there, along with many more common species
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover their knees, and also have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries provide shawls for women who have not prepared in advance, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, you will get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
According to the same logic, men must dress in pants that cover their knees.
This can also be borrowed from the stock in the entrance but those garments are not washed after each person so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all applies to men!
Majorcan food, as well as that in similar areas around the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses continuous olive oil.
A simple, popular dinner, especially during the summer, is Pa amb Oli: Bread with olive oil, tomato, and optional accessories available such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as Sie for the pronoun ni, are written in capital letters, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important method of distinguishing between certain verbs and objects.
According to some, it also makes it easier to read, but the need to find out if a verb or adjective is in noun form makes writing a bit more complicated.
The pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written
The letters to look out for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies based on the following vowels.
Also, make sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while caro means cart.
Persian has relatively light and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, you can get great help with learning a lot about Persian grammar and understanding sentences better if you read this basic book in grammar.
Of course, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese if you already know a Romance language.
But people who know a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it does not need to be studied separately.
Premodern observatories are usually obsolete today and remain as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution during their heyday was not the kind of problem they are today, they are usually found in cities or in university areas, easier to reach than those built during modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote locations with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami, or the view of the cherry blossom, has been part of Japanese culture since the 7th century.
The concept came from China where plum blossoms were used.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom feasts were held by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so try to resist the temptation to remove "only one" specimen.
"If you visit an arranged garden, and you pick a ""exemplary"" it will also get you thrown out, without discussion."
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to stay and very easy to navigate in, and you can buy almost anything upon arrival.
"But with its location in the ""high tropics"" just a few degrees north of the equator, you have to deal with both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, more rarely)."
There are also a small number of buses going north to Hebron, the traditional burial place where the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives rest.
Check that the bus you are thinking of taking goes to Hebron, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good starting point to base a holiday around.
For example, visit castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or take a boat trip to interesting cities on the Danube or a walk along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as Jesus’ birthday.
Many of the traditions around the weekend have also been addressed by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake at some open place to see the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may very well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold a Passover Mass on Saturday evenings during the Easter weekend. At midnight, the congregation breaks up to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here by either swimming, flying or floating.
Due to the long distance from the continent, mammals could not take over, and therefore the giant tortoise became the primary grazing animal on the Galapagos.
Since humans arrived in the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the areas of the Arctic or Antarctic winter time, you will experience polar nights, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a great opportunity to see the northern lights, as the sky is dark more or less around the clock.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, and therefore light pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the starry sky.
The Japanese working culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners may be accustomed to.
Costume is the normal business dress, and colleagues appeal to each other with surnames or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, where the emphasis is placed on joint efforts rather than on highlighting the performance of individuals.
Workers often have to get their superiors’ approval for any decisions they make and are expected to follow their superiors’ instructions without hesitation.
