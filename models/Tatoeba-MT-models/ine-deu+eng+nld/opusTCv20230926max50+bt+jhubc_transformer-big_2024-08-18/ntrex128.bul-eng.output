Members of the Welsh Assembly worry that they “seem like muppets”
Some members of the Assembly are appalled by the proposal to change their position to the ‘Welsh Chamber of Commerce’ (WP).
This proposal was provoked by plans to change the name of the Welsh Parliamentary Assembly.
Members across the political spectrum are worried that this could be a cause for ridicule.
One Labour member said his group was concerned that the new name was "rhyming with Dumb and Dumber."
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, this definitely has an offensive meaning.
According to one member of the Plaid party, the whole group is "not happy" and has offered alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was "not prejudiced" by the name change, but noted that the new name "MWP" has a certain verbal resemblance to "mupet".
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced similarly to the English pronunciation of the letter U.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently drawing up the draft bill to change the name, made the following statement: "Of course, the final decision for all descriptive names by which the members of the Assembly are called will belong to the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public inquiry into the proposals, which established broad support for the Assembly to start calling itself the "Parliament of Wales".
As for the position of its members, the Commission prefers "Member of Parliament of Wales, in short "CPU", but the "CPU" option has received the greatest support after being questioned by the public.
Members of the Assembly are proposing alternatives, but reaching a consensus is likely to be a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft bill for the change in a few weeks.
The reform bill will include other changes in the way the Assembly works, including rules for disqualification of its members, as well as the design of the commission system itself.
Members of the Assembly will have the final vote on what they will be called when they come to discuss the bill.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of their country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum is planned to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, in which there is an administrative area called “Macedonia”.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to Greek state territory, and has repeatedly objected to its attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who is opposed to the referendum on changing the name of the country, has said that he will not start the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of the country's name is simply the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin’s Bells Silence Against the Troubles of Churches in Harlem
“If we look at the historical plan, according to the old people I was talking to, there was a bar and a church literally at every corner,” Adams said.
“Both are missing today.”
Adams says the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
“People today socialize in different ways,” he adds.
“Bars are no longer the neighborhood living rooms where everyone gathers regularly.”
As for the churches, he expresses concern that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect, “and sooner or later they will be in the same position.”
The man adds that churches can be replaced by apartment blocks where people live who do not help with the survival of the rest of the sanctuaries in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy homes in these buildings will be white, which will speed up the process of closing these churches, as it is not particularly likely that most of the new settlers will visit them.”
Both churches were built by white shepherds before Harlem became a Black Quarter – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist herd moved out in the years after the 1930s.
After that, the building became the property of the black residents of the neighborhood.
“St. Martin” was sung by black Christians under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who organized a boycott against retailers on 125th Street, which is the main market street in Harlem, as they did not want to hire black employees.
In 1939, the building suffered heavy fire damage, but Father Johnson's parishioners drew up a plan for its restoration, ordering the bells.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly calls them “poor bells.”
The expert, who used the bells in July, has another description: “Cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument.”
Corresponding expert Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that it was the first bell system in the world to be used by black musician Dionysio A. Lind, who transferred to the larger system at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merryweather mentions that St. Martin's has never replaced him.
What has taken place in St. Martin over the past few weeks has been a complex fairy tale entwined by architects and performers, some led by worldly church leaders and others by an episcopal diocese.
They wrote to the diocese in July, expressing their concerns that the diocese "would be inclined to transfer the costs of the diocese", even though it did not have a role to play in the hiring of the archbishops.
Some parishioners have complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
13-Year-Old Boy Wounded by Shark in California
The shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy last Saturday while diving for lobsters in California on the first day of the hunting season, officials said.
The attack happened just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamle told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he dived with friends around half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and walked in with a group to get him out of the water.
Hamle first thought that the child had caught a lobster and was excited, then realized how he was shouting “Bitch me!
He bit me!"
Hamle shares that when he reached the boy, he found out that the entire area of his collarbone had been torn.
“I challenged everyone to get out of the water because there’s a shark!” adds Hamle.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the children's hospital "Radi" in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical condition.
It is not yet known what type of shark is responsible for the attack.
Rescue captain Larry Gilles told a media briefing that a shark had been spotted in the water a few weeks earlier, but was deemed not to be of a dangerous species.
Gilles adds that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to her upper body.
Authorities have closed access to the coastline from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Suomi in Encinitas for 48 hours for safety reasons while the investigation is underway.
Jills notes that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, most of which, however, do not pose a threat to humans.
Sainsbury is planning an offensive on the UK market for beautiful products
Sainsbury faces Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, opening booths for delightful products at their sites, where customers will be served by special assistants.
As part of the significant offensive in the UK beauty products market, which is valued at <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continues to grow, while sales of fashion and household products are declining, the country's largest yet-to-date beauty products stands will be located in 11 stores.
The investment curve in the beauty industry is made at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to use the space on the shelves recently occupied by TVs, microwave ovens and other household appliances.
Sainsbury’s said it would double the number of beauty products offered to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current product ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space, similar to the offers in Boots stores.
The supermarket is also re-launching its boutique makeup range so that most products can be used by vegans – something that is increasingly sought after by younger consumers.
In addition, the perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will try out discount programs at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, South London last week, while the second will be opened in Selli Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and shifting focus on shopping smaller amounts of food daily at convenient times leads to the fact that supermarkets need to put more effort into attracting buyers.
Mike Coop, Sainsbury’s chief executive, said the sites will look more and more like convenience stores as the supermarket chain struggles to deal with Aldi and Lidl discounters by offering more services and non-food items.
From Sainsbury’s, Argos has locations in hundreds of stores, and has also opened Habitats sites since they bought both chains two years ago – which the company claims has boosted food sales and made the acquisitions even more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to reshape its facilities for beautifying and pharmaceutical products has been unsuccessful.
Sainsbury made a joint experiment with Boots at the beginning of the new century, but the association ended after a dispute over the distribution of profits from the pharmaceutical company's facilities in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury sold its 281-site pharmaceutical business to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Lloyds will play a role in the plan by providing a wide range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Chief Commercial Officer, said: “We’ve transformed the look and character of our beautician stands to improve the overall experience for our customers.
We have also invested in special training for our colleagues, who will offer professional advice on the spot.
The range of brands we offer is designed to meet every taste and need in a captivating setting with a convenient location, making us an attractive destination for delightful products that challenges the very concept of the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby renounces <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Dragons star Peter Jones is “enraged” after TV host Holly Willuby gave up an <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle company to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willuby has no time for Truly household appliances and accessories brand.
The couple's business was compared to the Goop brand of Guinness Poltrow.
The 37-year-old leader of “This Morning” has announced her departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den star Peter Jones "cooking" after pulling out of their lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute - focusing on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "enraged" when the television "golden girl" admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant he would no longer have time for the act.
The business is akin to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Poltrow, with rumors that it has doubled the wealth of Willoughby, whose value is projected at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones left the UK by plane to head to one of her holiday properties.
One of the sources shared the following: “Truly was definitely Holly’s top priority.
It was expected to be her long-term commitment to secure her future over the next few decades.
Her decision to leave absolutely welds all completely unprepared.
No one believed it could happen on Tuesday, so close to the start.
There's a warehouse at the Marlowe plant that's full of products waiting to be sold."
Experts believe that the retirement of “This Morning,” which is one of the UK’s most successful stars, could cost the company millions because of the large investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household products, as well as the supply of household goods.
And last but not least, it can also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willuby, who is the mother of three children, along with her husband Dan Baldwin, has been a close friend of Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willuby herself founded Truly with Cap in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as president of the company in March.
The two families often go on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the M&S brand’s “ambassador” and will also replace Anne McParlin as the host of I Am Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones made the following statement last night: “We will not comment on his business affairs.”
Difficult Negotiations Leading to ‘Relationship Warming’
He joked about the criticism he would have received from news outlets about commenting, which someone would consider “unfit for the president” and too positive for the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump responded in a “journalistic” way.
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He noted that Kim expressed interest in a second meeting after the first was held in Singapore in June and was declared by Trump as “a major step towards eliminating North Korea’s nuclear weapons.”
Negotiations to eliminate these weapons are stalling.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Jung Ho told the UN General Assembly that North Korea "sees no reciprocal attitude" by the United States to its country's first steps towards disarmament.
Instead, the diplomat noted that the U.S. is continuing with sanctions aimed at maintaining tensions.
Trump presented in his speech a much more optimistic view of things.
“Our relations with North Korea are wonderful,” he said.
“We were on our way to war with this country.
Millions of people were going to die.
Instead, we are now enjoying a wonderful relationship.”
The president said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have led to positive results — cessation of missile tests, release of hostages, and returning home the bodies of U.S. military personnel.
He also defended his unorthodox approach to negotiations with Kim.
“It’s extremely easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded area, we’d have about 200 people right there,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastates island and kills hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-governmental organizations said they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok were forced to leave their homes, no national disaster was declared, which is a requirement to initiate international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases there is an unequivocal view that international aid is not sought, which makes things slightly challenging," Sumbung said.
While “Save the Children” is putting together a team to head for Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreign personnel will be allowed to operate on the country’s territory.
The national spokesman for the disaster agency, Mr. Sutopo, said Indonesian authorities are currently assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies should be allowed to contribute to the recovery efforts.
Taking into account the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains still unprepared for this type of natural disasters.
Although shelters were built in Aceh in the event of a tsunami, they are not common sightings on the other coasts.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu has likely contributed to the loss of life, despite a warning being issued.
Even under the best conditions, transport between the many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters complicate this logistics even more.
Recently stationed in Lombok to service the victims of the earthquake, a hospital ship has set sail for Palu, but it will take at least three days for it to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesia’s backward infrastructure at the center of his election campaign by investing a large amount of money in roads and railways.
But insufficient finances are constantly harassing his office, while Joko is making the urns again next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have taken a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands forced to leave their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs battled the streets with machetes, bows and arrows, as well as other primitive weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturgeon brings a late draw for Liverpool against Chelsea
Daniel Sturges saved Liverpool from a loss in the Premier League against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturge was handed a pass by Jerdan Shakiri about 27-28 meters from Chelsea's door, while his team was 1-0 behind.
He placed the ball on his left leg, then fired a precise shot at the far corner of the door.
The ball flew over the penalty area and pointed to the upper right corner of the net.
She transferred the ploughed Kepa Arisabalaga and weaved herself irresistibly into the net.
“I tried to take a good position to master the ball because players like Shak always look for submissions in front positions, so I just tried to win as much time as possible for a good shot at the door,” Stridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Cante, I pushed my ball and I just shot without much thought.”
Chelsea led 1-0 in the 25th minute after scoring a goal from Belgian star Eden Azar.
The Blues forward pitched a fifth to Mateo Kovacic, then sprinted from the middle of the field to half of Liverpool.
Forge exchanged a quick double feed in the center.
He then released a quick shot pass, with which he led Azar to a clean position in the penalty area.
Azar overtook the defenders and scored with his left foot in the far corner next to Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea’s next opponent will be Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
The death toll from Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country’s disaster agency said on Sunday.
Numerous people have been trapped amid the ruins of buildings that collapsed after the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that hit the country on Friday and led to waves as high as 20 feet, Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for the news agency, told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 people, is dotted with ruins from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was discovered this morning in Burkenhead, Mercyside.
The 44-year-old woman’s remains were found at 7:55 a.m. with wounds from a stabbing of Grayson Mouse on John Street, after a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking for assistance from anyone in the area who has seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is still at an early stage, but I beg everyone who has been near John Street in Burkenhead and has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers who may have filmed something with the cameras on their dashboard, to contact us, as it is possible that they have vital information for the investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman, whose body was found, was a resident of Burkenhead and that she was found in private property.
This afternoon a group of friends, who consider the woman to be a friend of theirs, arrived at the scene and asked where she was found in the morning.
The investigation continues, with police reporting that they are currently informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver, who lives on Grayson Mouse, tried to return to his apartment, but was informed by police that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
The man was silent when he found out what had happened.
Residents have been told it will take hours before they are allowed to return home.
One of the police officers told a man that the entire area was being treated as a crime scene.
There was a crying woman at the scene.
She keeps repeating, “This is so terrible.”
At 2 p.m., two police vans crossed the border while another van stayed outside.
At the border are police officers who are monitoring the housing block.
Anyone with information is requested to contact <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, code 247 on September 30.
Cromwell’s Parliamentary Statue Becomes the Latest Memorial Hit by “Rewriting History”
Its ban would be a poetic justice for his near-Taliban destruction of so many of English cultural and religious artifacts, which was carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "insanity" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate to remove statues that Oliver Cromwell's to Westminster Palace would become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither commissioned nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be made a victim because of the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent performance of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Tornicroft is proof of the 19th century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many still regard as deserving of respect.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps even more in the 19th century than he is today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, and of course in his case it is the monarchy.
Whether this is an entirely accurate presentation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is the conflict in the mid-17th century that shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a clearly recognizable person who represents one side of the division that has come.
His achievements as a Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and celebrated."
Pig Killer Kills Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwestern China, local media reported.
The man, identified only by his family name as Yuan, was found dead with a broken artery and covered in blood near a coffin in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pig farm was preparing to inject its pigs with vaccines on May 30, 2005 in Xinjiang, Qinghai Province, China.
He is believed to have arrived with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and he also welded the door to the neighboring barn open.
He also reported that there was a large male pig with a bloody auricle in the calf.
Forensic experts have confirmed that the 550-pound pig had attacked the farmer deadly, the report said.
“My cousin’s leg was bled and disfigured,” said Cousin Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
A security camera footage shows Yuan going to the market at 4:40 a.m. Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The killer did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked up so he could not attack anyone else while police were gathering evidence from the crime scene.
Yuan's family and market leaders are also reportedly negotiating compensation for the death.
Although they are rare, pigs that attack humans have previously been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, and after the attack the man was critically injured.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig had hooked a Welsh farmer to his tractor while his wife managed to chase him away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that the pigs were not usually aggressive, but the taste of the blood could act as a “trigger.”
“They’re just playing.
Pigs are like little children, extremely curious... they're not meant to hurt anyone.
But one must also treat them with respect,” the man concludes.
Weakening Hurricane Rosa Will Lead to Frequent and Flooding Rains in Southwestern U.S.
According to the weather forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cold waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will lead to flooding rains in northern Mexico and the southwestern parts of the United States.
The rose includes winds of 85 miles per hour, which is a Category 1 hurricane as of 5 a.m. Eastern time and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
During this time, over the Pacific Ocean begins to form the sincline, which moves east to the west coast of the United States. As the Rose approaches the Baha California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push the tropical moist part of the U.S. deep to the north.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in some areas of Mexico.
Over the next few days, the tropical moisture along with the approaching squint will create frequent heavy rains in the southwest.
At the local level 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous and fast flooding, littered streams and probable landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to rainfall of 2 to 3 inches per hour in certain locations, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the southwest, 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected, especially over most of Arizona.
It is possible to have flash floods in rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be extremely unwise to travel a handful in the desert when there is a threat of tropical rains.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into turbulent rivers, and thunderstorms will lead to rising dust and sizzling winds.
The approaching syncline will lead to heavy rains in some parts of California’s southern coast.
It is possible to reach precipitation of more than half an inch, which will lead to littered small waste streams and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainy season.
On late Sunday and early Monday, scattered clouds carrying tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona before the rains cover a larger area on late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread over the Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
October may bring large temperature fluctuations to the U.S. while the Arctic Ocean cools, but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature of short distances.
On Sunday there is a great example of the dramatic temperature changes in the central United States.
There is a 20-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to rise and expand.
Most of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to have a warm start in October, with temperatures of around 80 degrees Celsius from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
Temperatures in New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on six television networks the captivating spectacle of the testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blaisey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault that took place in the 1980s.
During this time, the political opposition continued, with the networks interrupting their regular turnaround programs in the last minutes of Friday: an agreement that was arranged by Arizona Senator Jeff Fleck and according to which the FBI should conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% convinced that Kavanaugh had been drinking and trying to take her clothes off during a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his emotionless testimony, is absolutely certain that such a thing has not happened.
It’s likely even more than Nielsen’s reported 20.4 million viewers watched the testimony on Friday.
The company has counted the average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There was no direct data available on the other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also traditionally has difficulty measuring the number of people looking at their jobs.
For comparison, we are talking about an audience similar in size to that of a championship football match or the Hollywood awards.
The Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, is the first of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, Nielsen reported.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million.
Interest remained high even after the hearing.
Fleck was the central figure in the Friday drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement that he would vote in support of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday filmed him whistled by protesters as he tried to catch an elevator for a meeting of the Judiciary Commission.
During all the harassment for a few minutes he never raised his eyes from the ground, which was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m right here, standing in front of you,” one woman said.
“Do you think he is presenting the truth to the state?
“You have power, while many women are completely helpless,” the attacks continued.
Fleck replied that a statement had already been issued from his office and before the doors of the elevator were closed, he announced that he would make a further statement during the committee hearing.
Cable and broadcast networks provided tight live coverage a few hours later when the Judiciary Committee had to decide whether to transfer Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for a vote.
But Fleck said he would only do so if he was sure the FBI would review charges against the nominee next week, which Democrats are pushing for in opposition.
Fleck was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Party senator Chris Koons.
After a conversation with Koons and several Senators, Fleck made a decision.
His election was definitely essential, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of ‘political play’ on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “political play” on Britain’s future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party’s conference in Birmingham, UK on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, published alongside her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson stepped up her attack on her so-called "Lady's Play Plan" for Brexit, saying a proposal was made that the EU's collection of customs duties was a "back to the UK".
Wade Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Suspect Dieten Simpson for LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at the LSU.
Dean Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge police department said.
Officials presented a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, with police reporting that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police discovered the glasses on the spot and also found Simpson's DNA on them, according to the CBS affiliate WAFB.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police announced that he had confessed to the fatal shooting at Wade.
His guarantee is set at $350,000, according to Advocate.
The forensic office of East Batton Rouge published a preliminary report on Friday that cited a gunshot wound to the head and neck as the cause of death.
The administration expresses its gratitude to the Louisiana State Police Refugee Search Department, the Police Crime Laboratory, Southern University Police and local residents for the assistance provided in the investigation that contributed to the arrest.
LSU athletics director Joe Aleva thanked local law enforcement for “timely justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot and 6-inch tall player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Waynes also played basketball for the LSU team.
On average, he scored 5.6 points and 2.6 rickoschets per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade reported that the team was "devastated" and "in shock" after Wade's death.
Wade said that “this is something that worries a person all the time.”
Volcano spreads ash over Mexico City
The ash ejected from the Popokatepetal volcano reached the southern quarters of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater surged and 183 gas and ash spills were recorded in the past 24 hours.
The center has witnessed numerous quakes and tremors.
Photos posted on social media show a thin layer of dust covering the windshields of cars in some of Mexico City’s neighborhoods, such as Hoquimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity of the volcano, which is located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, since an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the eve of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with the gendarmerie when thousands joined the opposing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarizing vote to secede.
A group of masked separatists, who were not allowed by the gendarmerie, began to scramble the peacekeepers with eggs and paint dust, creating dark and dusty clouds on the streets, which are usually crowded by tourists.
Later in the day, other clashes with the police occurred, with the police resorting to their sticks to master the situation.
For hours, pro-independence groups shouted "We don't forget, we don't forgive" while those who said they wanted to preserve the country's integrity responded with "Spain forever".
The local press reported that as a result of the protests, fourteen people received medical assistance for minor injuries.
Tensions remain high in the independence-seeking region even a year after the October 1 referendum was deemed illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The overwhelming majority voted to vote for independence, although the activity was low, as most opponents of the secession boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting in polling stations in the region with a series of turbulent clashes.
The pro-independence groups spent Friday night on the streets to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
However, the demonstration took place, but she was forced to take a different route.
Narcissus Termes, 68, an electrician who joined the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hoped for Catalonia's chances of gaining independence.
“Last year was one of our best times.
I saw my parents cry with joy when they could vote, but now we seem to be in a stalemate.”
Despite an important victory, whether by a small margin, in the regional elections of last December, supporters of Catalonia's independence political parties are experiencing difficulties this year, as many of their best-known leaders are either in self-imposed detention or have been arrested in anticipation of trial.
Hoan Piug, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone in support of police, said the conflict was provoked by politicians from both sides.
His comment is that “it’s getting more and more tense.”
On Saturday, Oriol Hunceras, one of the nine Catalan leaders arrested in anticipation of a preliminary trial last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
“My candidacy for the European elections is the best way to oppose the regression of democratic values and the repression that we are witnessing from the Spanish government.”
Londonderi: Men arrested after car crashes into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car crashed into a Londondery house several times.
The incident happened in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings has announced that damage has been done to both the gate and the building itself.
It is also possible that the car was shot with a crossbow.
Menga's goal brings Livingston's 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the win
The newcomer to the Premier League, Livingston surprised Rangers and inflicted only a second loss on Steven Gerard in his first 18 games as manager of the club from the Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's goal proved decisive, and Gary Holt's team equalled second in the Hibernian standings.
Gerard's team is left without a win on foreign ground in the Premier League this season, and next Sunday faces leader Harts, who is behind by eight points in the standings.
But before that, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingstone is already in a series of six games without a loss in the championship, and manager Holt has not yet felt the taste of the loss since he took over as Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone misses good opportunities against uninitiated guests
Holt's team had to lead in the score long before scoring a goal, and his direct style of play made Rangers extremely difficult.
Scott Robinson tested the defense, but his shot went to the side, after which Alan Litgow shot past the beam after Craig Hulkett returned the ball with his head to him.
The hosts left Rangers to play the ball, knowing that they could seriously hamper guests from static positions.
And that is how we got to the winning goal.
The Rangers committed a foul, and Livingston played well, as Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined and brought out Menga, who led the ball and scored from the middle of the penalty field.
By this point, the Rangers had mastered the ball more, but faced the unbreakable protection of the hosts, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly rarely had to intervene.
This style of play continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a rescue.
Rangers' goalkeeper saved Scott Pitman's foot shot, and Littleowe's head shot passed by the door after another static position for Livingston.
Livingstone’s penalty area was full of centrists, but they were easily cleaned up, and the judge twice failed to respect the guests’ claims for a dozen – first after a one-off fight between Halkett and the Glenn Middleton Reserve, and then in case of doubts about hand play.
“Phänomenal” by Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal game and a great result for Livingston.
The team plays just superbly, continuing to exceed expectations and improve their performance.
The style of play and line-up have hardly changed since the team's return to the Premier League, but Holt deserves much praise for the way he transformed the team after his appointment.
He has real heroes on the field.
Captain Hulkett was amazing, arranging the defense in an excellent way, while Menga was constantly keeping Connor Goldson and Joe Warall under stress.
At the same time, Rangers showed nothing inspiring.
Under Gerard's leadership, they demonstrate some great things, but in this case they were far below those standards.
They missed the last pass before the goal, having only managed to split the hosts’ defense once – this loss must awaken the Rangers, who are currently in the middle of the standings.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an receives mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th) we witnessed smiles and blue spaces when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
The friendly relationship cools down due to problems affecting human rights, media freedom and Turkey’s admission into the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to find a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest group of Turks living outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police prevented a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters rallied around to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also raised their voices, condemning both Erdogan’s own policies and the German government’s decision to allow him into the country.
The various protests reflect a rift caused by a visitor who is seen as a hero by some German Turks and at the same time despised as a despot by others.
Road accident in Deptford: Rider rests after a collision with a car
A cyclist has died after a car crash in London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and medical assistance arrived, but the cyclist died on the spot.
The crash comes months after another rider died after being hit by a runaway driver on Childers Street, which is a mile from the scene of Saturday’s crash.
The Metropolitan Police announced that its employees are working on identifying the man, after which they will inform his relatives.
The road is closed and bus lines are diverted, and motorists are also advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Jail: Six guards injured in riot
Six prison guards were injured in a riot at a high-security male prison, the prisons’ office said.
The protest erupted at Long Lartin Prison in Worcester at around 9:30 a.m. British time on Sunday and is still ongoing.
In order to seize him, special officers from the Tordano unit have been summoned, who will have to deal with eight detainees, including the rioting himself in a confined to one wing of the prison.
The injured guards suffered minor injuries to their faces and received medical attention on the spot.
A spokesman for the Prisons Office said: “Specially trained staff have been called in to deal with the incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six of the officers received medical attention.
We do not tolerate any violence in our prisons and we very clearly state that those responsible will be handed over to the police, and their sentences may be extended.”
There are more than 500 prisoners in Long Lartin prison, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that after an attack by a prisoner, the prison director had to be treated in a hospital.
Also in October last year, riot police were summoned to the prison to deal with a serious riot in which the staff was attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with lightning floods (although arid areas may benefit)
It’s rare for Arizona to be hit by a tropical storm, but it’s highly likely that this will happen early next week as debilitating Hurricane Rosa sweeps through the southwestern desert, bringing with it the risk of lightning floods.
The National Weather Service has already established posts against lightning floods on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, in southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including in the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a different route over Phoenix on Tuesday, with rain coming late on Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have sustained tropical storms within 200 miles of Phoenix!!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rain with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in Mogolon Rome, Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, with up to 4 inches of rainfall possible in separate locations.
For those who are not threatened by lightning floods, the rain caused by the Rose can actually be a blessing, as the region is severely affected by drought.
Although floods are extremely serious concerns, some of the rain is likely to be useful as the southwestern part is currently arid.
“According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Commission, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least excessive drought, which is the second most severe category.”
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to landfall at the Baha California Peninsula in Mexico.
The rose, which still boasts a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, is located 385 miles from Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm encounters cooler waters over the Pacific Ocean and therefore weakens.
It is therefore expected to reach Mexico’s drylands by the force of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rain over part of Mexico can be heavy and lead to significant risk of bloating.
"Total rains of up to 6 inches from Baha California to northwest Sonora are expected, with up to 10 inches possible," the report said.
Rose will then head north through Mexico like a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression that will then pass through Arizona in southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
"The main risk of Rosa or its consequences is extremely heavy rain in Baha California, northwest Sonora and the desert southwest of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening flash floods and carrying various waste streams in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old child was found with stabbing wounds in Somerset.
The wounded boy was discovered in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4 a.m. British time on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where his condition remained “stable”.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, police in Aven and Somerset said.
The police are asking anyone who may have captured what happened to them to contact them.
Trump says Kavanaugh “has suffered from the arrogance and anger” of the Democratic Party
“Every vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that rejects the insidious and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh was "suffering from the arrogance and anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, sharply rejecting Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation of sexual assault decades ago when the two were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the prosecution's hearing.
The president said Saturday that "the American people today have witnessed the intelligence, courage and qualities" of Kavanaugh.
“Every vote in support of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in support of one of the most brilliant legal minds of our century, a real lawyer with a wonderful reputation in the public service,” the president told a crowd of supporters from West Virginia.
The president indirectly saw Kavanaugh's nomination as he talked about the importance of Republican votes for the general election.
“There are five weeks left until one of the most important elections of our time.
“Although I’m not a candidate, I’m actually a candidate,” Trump said.
"That's why I'm running around and I'm fighting to support good candidates."
Trump said the Democrats had set themselves the mission of “obstructing and obstructing.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior Republican official told CNN.
Hundreds die after Indonesia earthquakes and tsunami, death toll rises
At least 384 people lost their lives after many were swept away by sluggish waves off the coast when a strong earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia’s Sulawesi island, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when at dusk the coast was swept away by waves up to six meters (18 feet) high, taking many to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami erupted after an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
"When the threat of tsunami rose yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not escape immediately, which is why many became victims of the disaster," Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, the spokesman for the Innedo disaster management agency, told a briefing in Jakarta.
“The water had pulled cars, trees, entire houses, hit everything in its path,” Nugroho continued, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph) before hitting the coast.
“Some people climbed the trees and managed to escape from the water,” he added.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated in 24 centres in Palu.
Air photos released by the disaster agency showed multiple destroyed buildings and shops, demolished and twisted bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
Secondary quakes continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area inhabited by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) issued a statement that the energy released by Friday’s massive earthquake was about 200 times stronger than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The declaration also mentions that the geographical location of the city, which is located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as “huge” and specified that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found beneath the ruins of the collapsed buildings, the spokesman added, after which he added that 540 people were injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be higher along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the trunk.
He also added that “communications are completely cut off and there is no information from Donggala.”
The Red Cross said more than 300,000 people live there, adding that its teams and volunteers had already made their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can be made even more difficult.”
On Saturday, the agency was fiercely criticized for not informing about the affected Palu tsunami, although officials explained that the waves had arrived at the time of the announcement.
Shared on social networks amateur videos show a man on the top floor of a building shouting panic warnings to people on the street about the approaching tsunami.
After a few minutes, a huge water wall hits the shore and affects both cars and buildings.
Reuters failed to verify the authenticity of the video in a timely manner.
The earthquake and tsunami led to a severe power outage that stopped communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuees still desperately need food and other essential products.
The city’s airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centers in Pali on Sunday.
More than 800 people have died in the Indonesian tsunami.
The situation is extremely bad.
While World Vision employees from Donggala managed to reach Palu safely, where they found shelter in tarpaulin shelters stretched out in the backyard of their office, they passed a number of scenes of devastation, Doseba said.
“They told me they’d seen countless homes destroyed.”
The situation is extremely bad.
Despite the work on rescue and recovery operations of emergency groups, some complain that those with extensive experience in such situations are prevented from reaching Palu by foreign rescuers.
According to the Indonesian regulations, financing, dispatch of personnel and supplies from abroad can only be started if the affected area is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
“The disaster is still at a regional level,” said Auliya Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government announces that this is a national disaster, we can accept international aid, but they have not yet declared such a status."
As Palu falls on the second night after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, the friends and families of those who are still unknown continue to hope for a miracle and that their loved ones somehow survived the natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been buried under the ruins for two days along with her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia’s national paragliding team, has trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Championship, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among those trapped at the Roa-Roa hotel were his students, Mr. Mandagi added.
“As a senior in the paragliding field, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon recalled how in the hours after news of the collapse of the Roa-Roa hotel reached the paragliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to competitors in Palu who participated in the beach festival.
Instead of a pair of blue marks, however, the only response to his messages was a single gray one.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he added.
Thieves Raise $26,750 While Loading an ATM at Levi's Newport
On Friday morning, thieves raised $26,750 from a Brink employee who loaded an ATM into Levi’s Newport, a press release from the Newport Police Department said.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to charge it with money, writes Detective Dennis McCarthy in the message.
While the man was busy, another man “approached running behind Brink’s employee’s back” and stole a bag of money.
Witnesses have spotted many suspects fleeing the scene, the statement continues, but police have not indicated the number involved in the theft.
Anyone who has information about the identity of the suspects should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Along with the announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday, he also wrote: “The man officially known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has been using it as a title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change precedes his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaced singer Ariana Grande in the show, who gave up "for emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously claimed that the word has religious significance for him.
"I believe 'she' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means 'you' or 'you'," West said earlier this year as he discussed the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, it is us.
He passed from Kanye, which means only one person, simply to Ye – which is a reflection of the good in us, of the evil, of the confusion, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of our nature.”
The rapper is one of many known in his field who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has a number of nicknames and names, including Puff Daddy, Pi Diddy, or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the pseudonyms Lion and Brother Lion.
One of West's former collaborators, Jay-Z, also introduced himself in a version with or without a dash and/or capital letters in his nickname.
Mexico's president vows not to use military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to never use military force as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody repression against students.
On Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza, President Lopez Obrador pledged "never to use the army to oppress the Mexican people."
The soldiers fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people, while student movements with left-wing political views gradually spread across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to support young Mexicans by providing monthly scholarships to students and opening more free public universities.
The president also concluded that unemployment and lack of access to education are attracting young people to criminal gangs.
U.S. to double funding for AI development
At a time when China is becoming increasingly active on the AI development front, the U.S. must double its research budget in this area, according to AI researcher and developer Kai-Fu Loi, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment was made after various units of the U.S. government made statements on the subject of AI, although the U.S. generally does not have an official strategy for AI.
In the meantime, China unveiled its plan last year: the country aims to become No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for AI development will be a good start given that all other countries are far ahead of the United States and are about to make further breakthroughs in terms of AI," Lee said.
Doubling funding could also double the chances of the next big AI breakthrough coming from the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview last week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s largest AI companies – Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie University, Melanie Lee worked on an AI system that defeated the most successful otel player in America, after which he was CEO of Microsoft Research and president of Google’s Chinese branch.
Lee blamed the previous technology competitions on the federal government, such as the Agency’s robotics competition for advanced defense research projects, and asked when the next one would be, which would help to recognize the new visionaries.
“Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to earn government funding,” Lee said.
“It’s not China that’s taking away academic leaders, it’s corporations,” he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university lights to work on AI.
Lee also argues that changes in immigration policy could help the U.S. strengthen its AI program.
“I think that doctors in the AI sciences should automatically be offered green cards,” he said.
The U.S. State Council announced its plan to develop next-generation artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to people from academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other state organizations fund researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to include industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the establishment of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, they currently invest more than $100 million a year in the development of AI.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, which wanted to set up a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has not noted any activity in months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of their country
Citizens of Macedonia voted in a referendum this Sunday to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia." This is a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which blocks Macedonia's membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where there is an area called Macedonia, argues that the name of its northern neighbor represents claims against its territorial integrity, which is why it vetoes its inclusion in NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia’s Slavic majority.
President George Ivanov said he himself would not vote in the referendum, while a campaign to boycott it casts a shadow over whether the referendum will manage to reach the minimum 50 percent required to recognize its validity.
The question on the bulletins is: “Do you support NATO and EU membership by adopting the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, which includes Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying to achieve the entry of the Yugoslav state of Macedonia formed after the break-up of organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I came to give my voice to the future of the country, to the young Macedonians, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, a 79-year-old citizen of Skopje.
Although the referendum has no binding force, enough members of parliament have said they will comply with the result to such an extent that the vote already has a decisive weight.
To change the name of the country, two-thirds of parliamentarians must vote for it.
The state election commission said there had been no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, electoral activity was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters visited the polls.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old citizen of the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zoritsa and their son Dusko voted in the referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country, which will open the way for accession to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, at 54, Vladimir Kavadarkov was preparing a small stage and arranging chairs in front of the tents, stretched by the boycotters of the referendum.
“We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with proudly raised heads, not through the door for servants,” Kavadarkov said.
“Our country may be poor, but we still have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Eurasian Union.”
Prime Minister Zaev argues that NATO membership will lead to the necessary investments for Macedonia, as unemployment in the country is over 20 percent.
"I believe that the vast majority will be with us, as more than 80 percent of our citizens prefer the EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his own vote.
The official also said that the positive result will lead to “consolidation of the future of our people”.
Last Monday, the Macedonian Institute for Political Studies published results of a survey according to which between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum - which is under the necessary activity.
Another survey, carried out by Macedonian TV Telma, revealed that 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said they would vote “yes”.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the electoral activity must be 50% plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious blow against the pro-Western government’s policy since it won power in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero passes through Brighton's entire defense and scores a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling overcame Brighton's defense and brought Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Playing Aguero for his goal in the 65th minute seemed too easy.
It all started when the Argentinian goalkeeper was found with a pass in the middle of the field.
He races three defenders from Brighton before sprinting the ball into the empty space ahead.
Aguero was then surrounded by four players in green.
He sneaked past one of the defenders, then left the rest behind on the border of Brighton's criminal court.
Then he turned left to Stirling.
The English striker with one touch returned the ball back to Aguero, who struck with his right foot over Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan and found the right corner of his goal.
“Aguero is struggling with some injuries in his legs,” City Manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“He was going to play 55-60 minutes.
And look what happened.
We were lucky to have scored a goal right now.”
But Stirling was the one who provided the initial lead for the "heavyweights" in this match of the Premier League of England.
He scored in the 29th minute.
In the situation for the naked Aguero got a submission deep in the middle of Brighton.
He immediately released a passing pass on the left flank to Leroy Sanne.
Sane advanced with the ball, then found Stirling with a pass on the far beam.
The assailant of the "blue sky" managed to catch close up, just before the ball came out.
City will face Hoffenheim in a Champions League group stage match at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon at the Rain Necar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer wants to play determine the fate of the Rockies
Since the Nationals did not qualify for the playoffs, it makes no sense for another game on a title starting pitcher.
Still, the ambitious Sherzer always hopes to be in the lead Sunday against the Colorado Rockies if the match matters to the Rockies, who lead by one game to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West standings.
The Rockies have secured at least a wild card game after a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday night, but are still unsure if they will win their first division title.
“Although we don’t fight for anything, we want to end the season with a nice game in Denver, where the audience and the other team will do their best to win perhaps the most important game of the year for them.
Why would I want to miss a game like that?”
The Nationals have not yet announced a starting pitcher for Sunday, but are expected to allow Scherzer to participate if the match is decisive.
For Scherzer, it would be his 34th game as a starting pitcher this year, as he held a practice on Thursday and would have normal rest time until Sunday.
Washington’s right-handed pitcher has a balance of 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump is recruiting supporters in West Virginia.
The president hinted at the situation with his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of Republican votes in the general election.
“In November, everything we have achieved will be put at risk.
There are five weeks left until one of the most important elections of our lives.
“This is one of the biggest moments in current history – I also say that although I’m not a candidate, I’m actually also involved, that’s why I’m fighting hard for the right candidates,” Trump said.
“You all see this terrible, terrifying radical group of democrats, you see them with your own eyes.
They are determined to regain power in any way, you yourself are witnessing their mercilessness, their malice.
They don’t care when they can hurt, who they have to run over to cling to power and governance, because they only care about power and governance, but we won’t give them.”
The Democrats, according to the president, have set themselves the goal of “obstructing and obstructing.”
“What we’ve all seen in the last four days,” he continued, calling the Democrats “angry, disgusting, mean and unfaithful.”
The president recalled the Senate Judiciary Committee, mentioning Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein by name, which provoked strong cheers from the crowd.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you spread the document?
Please, what?
No, no, I waited – it was a really nasty gesture – perhaps the worst I’ve ever seen.”
Labour is no longer broad-based.
The party is not tolerant of those who speak openly
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, few were surprised.
After all, I’m just the last Labour Member of Parliament who has been told he’s not welcome – just because I’m speaking frankly.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, has been given a similar attitude because she has been resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, censorship criticizes me for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, topics that are ironically similar to those with which Jeremy disagreed during the time of previous leaders.
A notice of the Nottingham East Labour Assembly on Friday said that “we want the meetings to involve everyone and be fruitful.”
For most of my eight years as a local Labour representative in Parliament, Friday meetings were just that.
Unfortunately, today the tone of most meetings and promises of “lighter and more moderate” politics have long been forgotten if they were ever on the agenda.
It became increasingly obvious that different views were not tolerated in the Labour Party and that every opinion was judged on the basis of how much the leadership of the party liked it.
This started soon after Jeremy became a leader, while colleagues I had worked for before believed to share similar political views began to expect me to turn around and take positions that I would never agree with – be it on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I make public statements – no matter what I’m actually saying – I follow a whole offensive tyranny on social media, calling for withdrawal, rejection of moderate politics, statements that I don’t belong to the Labour Party.
Like that doesn't happen to just me.
In fact, I know that I was even more fortunate than some of my colleagues, as the comments for me are at least mostly political in nature.
I can only admire the professionalism and purposefulness of those colleagues who face sexist or racist understatements every day without being afraid of them.
One of the biggest disappointments of this era in politics is how such insults became the norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said Labour should embrace a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that the party is far from wide-ranging, and with every sign of distrust or a change in the rules of choice becomes increasingly narrow.
Over the past two years, I’ve been given a lot of advice not to talk too much and that “everything will be fine.”
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student provoked by the Thatcher government, which through its neglect led to the literal disintegration of my excellent school, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most – whether as a local-level adviser or as a minister.
I have never concealed my political views, including during the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused in any way by my political position and my disagreement with the current leadership.
To all those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that when the state aspires to Brexit, it will hurt households, companies and the public sector, and I do not understand the desire to waste my time and energy in loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But really my message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or political exclusion will refuse me to act in the way that I consider to be in your best interest.

Air 38-17 Melrose: Invincible Air Leads the Ranking
The two late essays may have changed the final score slightly, but there’s no doubt that Air deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting match from Tennent’s Premier League.
The team is already leading the standings and the only one of the ten teams is without a loss so far.
Better protection and better use of opportunities proved crucial in the match, which coach Peter Murci and his team can be very happy about.
"I'm happy because the other teams have tested us quite seriously in the past games, and we're still without a loss," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said, “Congratulations to Air, they really benefited from their positions better than we did.”
Grant Anderson's essay in the 14th minute, followed by a successful additional strike by Frasier Climo, brought Air forward in the result, but a yellow card for Scottish national Rory Hughes, released to play a relay from the Warriors, allowed Jess to catch up in the result.
Climate increased the lead for Ear from a penalty kick just before halftime, marking an essay after a solo action, and then realizing the additional kick, which made the score 17-5 for Ear on vacation.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's essay, followed by a successful additional blow from Bagot, reduced the lead by only five points.
There was a prolonged cessation of the game due to a severe injury to Rouarid Not, which was carried out on a stretcher, and after the resumption of the game Air increased their advance after an essay by Stafford McDowell and a successful additional hit by Climo.
Then Air Blair McPherson's acting captain received a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of their numerical advantage, exerting strong pressure and realizing an essay through Bruce Colvin, followed by an unsuccessful additional blow.
However, the hosts regained their presence of spirit, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card after knocking down Climo without a ball, McPherson realized an essay with the help of Air's advancing offensive line.
Climate realized the additional blow, and not long after did it again, after Kyle Rowe caught the kicked ball from David Armstrong and took the wing Gregor Henry on the flank for the fifth essay of the hosts.
The Still Game star seems to be heading for a new career in the restaurant business
Still-Game star Ford Kiernan appears to be heading for a more direct and warmer industry after it was revealed that he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, on which he is also a screenwriter and one of the two stars along with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemfil.
The two announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last for the show, with Kiernan already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor abstained from commenting, although a source from Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan intended to join Glasgow's "blossoming restaurant business."
‘The sea is ours’: Bolivia hopes the ship will once again open the way to the Pacific Ocean
The sailors are constantly patrolling the rigged marine headquarters in La Paz.
Above the public buildings there is an ocean blue flag.
The sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are lined with the motto: “The sea belongs to us by right.
It is our duty to get it back.”
Across Bolivia, which has no access to the ocean, the memory of the lost exit handed over to Chile after a bloody conflict in the 19th century is still alive – and the call to sail across the Pacific again.
In fact, this hope is currently the strongest in decades, while Bolivia awaits a verdict from the international court on October 1, after five years of reflection have already passed.
“The strength is in Bolivia, there is a sense of unity everywhere, and the country expects a positive result,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Kalzadila.
Many Bolivians will watch the international court’s verdict on the big screen across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will support Bolivia’s demand and that after decades of negotiations, Chile will be obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the ocean.
Here Morales, the charismatic local president of Bolivia, who is set to embark on a contested re-election battle next year, has also staked much on the court’s judgment on Monday.
“We are very close to regaining access to the Pacific Ocean,” Morales said.
But some analysts believe that the probability of the court making a decision in favor of Bolivia is quite small. At the same time, even if it ruled in its favor, it would not change things into reality.
The U.N. body in the Netherlands has no power to take over Chile and has decided it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the verdict of the international court is only six months after the hearing of the latest arguments indicates that the case "is not complex," said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of contributing to Bolivia’s cause, the last four years may actually have hurt her.
“The problem of access to the ocean has been inflated by the current Bolivian government,” Zarate said.
He then hinted that Morales’ warlike rhetoric had erased the few remaining goodwill of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be extremely difficult after a normal dialogue has taken place.
The two countries have not supported diplomatic missions in each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltse, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was taken unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “an incredible opportunity to open the page of a new era in its relations with Chile,” as well as a chance to “end 139 years of disagreement by achieving benefits for both sides.”
Kalzadila also rejected the idea that Morales — who remains one of Latin America’s most popular presidents — has used the problem of access to the ocean as a “political patsy.”
“Bolivia will never give up its right to leave the Pacific,” he added.
“Condemnation is an opportunity to see that we must overcome our past problems.”
North Korea says it will not continue nuclear disarmament until it can trust the United States
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his country would never proceed to nuclear disarmament first if it was not able to trust Washington.
Mr. Ri presented his speech to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises it made during the meeting between the leaders of the opposing countries in Singapore.
His comment comes after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears on the verge of restarting stalemate on nuclear diplomacy more than three months after his meeting in Singapore with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.
Ri called the idea that continuing U.S. sanctions and objections to a declaration to end the Korean War would bring the North to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang first making a significant gesture toward disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that in Pyongyang they are serious about giving up an arsenal they see as the only way to ensure their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to arrange the preparations for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion reviews in Paris reveal the latest cry for massive hats that will soon be in the fashion stores next to you
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely block out the sun's rays, you don't need to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown unveiled a range of incredibly large hats from their upcoming SS19 collection that dazzled the fashion scene during Paris Fashion Week.
Quite impractical hats caused a wave on Instagram in the summer, with designers sending eye-catching creations to dazzle the fashion community.
Valentino’s prominent proposition was an extravagant beige cap with a feather-like wide periphery that literally absorbed the heads of the models.
Other too-huge accessories included jeweled melons, a magic hat, and even pineapple — but they’re not meant to keep you warm.
Tom Brown also unveiled a selection of strange masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sewn lips and resembled not so much superior fashion as Hannibal Lecter.
One of the designs resembled a full-pack dive gear with a snorkel and glasses, while the other looked like melted funnel ice cream.
If you fall for such fashion trends, then you are in luck.
Fashion specialists predict that huge hats will soon be sold at fashion stores near you.
The huge hats come very soon after La Bomba – the straw hat with a periphery of two feet, which was seen on everyone’s heads – from Riana to Emily Rataykowski.
The cult of the extremely impractical hat, which took over social networks, led to the appearance of another huge design of the fashion podium – a straw beach bag, almost as big as the wearer dressed in a swimsuit model.
The orange-coloured raffia bag, with raffia eyelashes and a white leather handle, was the eye-catching item in Jacquemus’s La Riviera SS19 collection during Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitide told FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags in fashion stores next summer – after the designer has made such a big impression, it will be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language Skills Are Essential for Global Citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a reputation for academic excellence, continuing in 2018 with another excellent performance of the test scores, which is only enhanced by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other social sciences.
With up to 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Association of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to offer the best possible level to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for their further education, their chosen career, and their place in a global world.
As an educational sector that can compose and implement a personalized curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to someone in a language that you can understand, your words can get to him.
But if you speak his own language, you touch his heart.”
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on the English language when we want to build relationships and trust with the peoples of other countries.
Through the results of this year’s exams, we see that languages are in the first place with the highest success for independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved a high grade A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72% of students had a grade A in Chinese, while the same grade had 72% of German learners, 69% of French learners and 63% of those with Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland perceive foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will definitely need for the future.
Currently, languages as subject of free choice by students receive the same treatment as natural-mathematical disciplines (scientific, technological, engineering and mathematical disciplines) both in the programs of independent schools and beyond.
A 2014 study conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission found that 17% of employers found that they lacked sufficient language skills because of the reasons why employers find it difficult to find employees.
Therefore, it is becoming increasingly necessary to master foreign languages in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
More and more job positions require mastering a foreign language, which makes these skills essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if a person masters a foreign language, he will have a real advantage in the future, having mastered such a skill that remains for a lifetime.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts the multilingual person one breast ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to be able to speak a language, with French being the only language with a two-digit rate of 15%.
That’s why investing in language learning today is important for children now.
Mastering several languages, especially those of developing economies, will provide children with a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, each school will be different from the languages taught.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered to be more important to the UK in a future plan by 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interests, there will always be enough languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers being experts in their field.
Independent schools in Scotland are determined to provide an educational environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed in life, no matter what the future holds.
There is no denying that, in a global business environment, languages continue to play an incredibly important role in the future of any country that needs to take this into account in the education system.
And indeed, modern languages should really be considered as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, along with diversity and excellent quality, to young people in Scotland.
You have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Association of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his Lakers debut this Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans who are thrilled to see LeBron James’ first game with the Los Angeles Lakers team.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will take part in the team's first game of pre-season preparation against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It is not yet clear how many minutes he will play in the match.
“It will be on the field between one and 48 minutes,” joker Walton announced via Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James was likely to play a relatively few minutes in the game.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the six games of Lakers' pre-season preparation.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare for the new season,” he said.
Trump's rally in West Virginia, a YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of election rallies tonight in Willing, West Virginia.
This is the first of five planned Trump rallies that include stops at well-known locations, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
By postponing the affirmative vote for his election to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to support the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans are threatened with a loss of control over Congress in the November vote.
What time will the Trump rally in West Virginia take place tonight and how can you watch online?
Trump’s visit to Willing, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. Eastern Time this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s visit to Willing, West Virginia, below by streaming live on YouTube.
Trump will likely look at this week’s hearings on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which sparked tension over allegations of immoral sexual acts, which held the Senate’s affirmative vote for up to a week while an FBI investigation is underway.
The main goal of this series of rallies, however, is to help Republicans gain momentum for the November elections.
That’s why President Donald Trump’s campaign announced that these five rallies next week are aimed at “activating volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and in the House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Control over Congress is so essential to his program that the president will visit as many states as possible and we are starting a campaign season full of commitments,” a spokesman for Trump’s campaign told Reuters.
The rally tonight, scheduled for Wesbanco Arena in Willing, could bring back supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw the media’s attention from Pittsburgh,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump’s second visit this month will take place in West Virginia, where he won by more than 40% in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia’s Senate candidate, Republican Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in sociological polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has come to give him a boost in sociological research,” said Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
The 2018 Ryder Cup: The U.S. team will fight to the last, keeping their hopes alive before the singles on Sunday
After three consecutive sessions with no Foursome intrigue, the Sunday afternoon games may have brought what the Ryder Cup needed.
Changing the advantage in sport is a rather subjective concept, however, in which players believe unreservedly, even more so in races like this.
So, which team is in a better position right now?
“They led by six points, and now there are only four, so I guess we’ve got a little bit of inertia,” Spite said at the end of today’s race.
Of course, Europe has a four-point advantage with only twelve more to allocate.
However, as Spite says, Americans have more to show and their fans should not lose hope if we are to judge by the sport of Spite and Justin Thomas, who played together throughout the day and each of them took three out of four possible points.
Speat shows excellent form from the beginning to the end of each hole and is the true leader of his team.
The cheering cheers of the fans grew stronger as he progressed in the round, in which with a precise punch he equalized the result in the fourth match, after together with Thomas they were behind with two punches after the first two holes.
His blow, which won them the 15th hole game, was met with strong enthusiastic reactions that make us believe that really not everything is lost for the American team.
“The important thing is not to think about anything else and focus on your own game,” says Speight.
That's all that's left for these players now.
18 holes to be remembered.
The only players with more points than Speet and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed heroes of the Rider Cup so far.
The strange, but delightful couple from Europe, won four out of four and seems to be doing it all.
Mollywood were the only couple who did not make "gods" on Sunday afternoon, but they also did not have "gods" either on Saturday morning or Friday afternoon or morning.
These successes, as well as the way the energy seemed to pass between them and the enthusiastic fans, have solidified the belief that they are the players who will win on Sunday and there will be no better pair than Fleetwood and Molinari who will bring the National over Europe's potential victory.
Preferably both at different holes at the same time.
However, the tales of European fame turned out to be a bit premature.
Buba Watson and Web Simpson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's four-ball matches, while he partnered with Alex Noren.
The Gods and two doubles in the first nine holes put the Spaniard and the Swede in trouble, which they failed to cope with.
However, in Sunday matches, no one else can solve your problems.
“Fourball” and “foursome” matches are extremely interesting to watch closely because of the interactions between couples, the tips they exchange with each other, and the way a strategy can undergo changes at any given moment.
The Europeans played better as a team, and so they gained a significant lead before the last day, but this session of "foursome" matches showed that the American team is also ready to fight to the end - something that many people, especially in the United States, strongly doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will have a solid lead ahead of the last day of the Ryder Cup, after leading the United States 10-6 after playing four-ball and four-steam matches on Saturday.
Inspiring duet Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari started with two victories against the inconclusive Tiger Woods, increasing their Le Golf National race assets by four points.
In an attempt to regain the trophy he lost to Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Bjorn’s European team dominated the morning four-ball games over the Americans who made a mistake after a mistake, and eventually Europe won the series with 3–1 wins.
The U.S. showed more resistance in the foursome matches, where it won two victories, but failed to narrow the gap.
Jim Furick’s team needs 8 points from 12 singles matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first rookie in Europe to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari, known by the nickname "Mollywood", became only the second pair to win four points from their first four games in the history of the Rider's Cup after this sensational weekend.
After the Woods and Patrick Reed unapologetically played in the four-ball matches, they were extremely motivated to beat the broken Woods and American rookie Bryson Decambu with an even more categorical score of 5&4.
Woods, who barely made it through his two games on Saturday, only occasionally demonstrated outbursts of his genius, but so far he has 19 losses out of 29 games in "fourball" and "foursome" matches, as well as a total of seven consecutive losses.
Justin Rose, who received a break for the morning fourball matches, partnered with Henrik Stanson in the foursome clashes in the 2&1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kopka – respectively number one and number three in the world.
However, the team of Europe failed to enjoy a completely pleasant, cool and cloudless day southwest of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Speet and Justin Thomas regained American hopes by scoring two points on Saturday.
They scored a tough 2<0xC2><0xA7>1 win against Spaniards John Ram and Jan Polter in the four-ball games, and later returned to beat Polter and Rory McIlroy in the 4&3 games, despite losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the "Raider Cup" has a team accumulated a four-point deficit before the singles, according to the regulations the team of Fourik will keep the trophy even in the event of a tie.
However, after they were played on two consecutive days, it seems that their chances of turning around on Sunday are not particularly high.
North Korea says there is “no way” to disarm unilaterally without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions deepened distrust of the United States and there was no way the country could unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
At the annual general meeting of the World Organization, Ri Yong-how said that in the last year "significant goodwill measures" have been taken, for example, we are halting nuclear and missile tests, destroying the nuclear test site and promises not to spread nuclear weapons and technology.
“However, we do not see a corresponding reaction from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, we will not believe in our own national security, and under no circumstances will there be any way to disarm ourselves unilaterally.”
While Ree voiced well-known complaints by North Korea about Washington’s resistance to a “stage-by-stage” approach to eliminating nuclear weapons, in which North Korea would be rewarded for taking step-by-step action, his statement appeared to be significant because it did not refute the one-sided pact.
Ree cited a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim vowed to work for "nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula" and Trump gave security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the 1950–1953 Korean War, but the U.S. says Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls for easing stringent international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on “first removing nuclear weapons” and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal through coercion, and even opposes the “declaration of an end to the war,” Ri said.
“The notion that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a meaningless dream for those who don’t know us.
The problem, however, is that the ongoing sanctions deepen our mistrust.”
Ree did not mention whether a second meeting between Kim and Trump was planned, which the U.S. leader stressed at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister emphasized the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If the country on the issue of nuclear disarmament were South Korea, and not the United States, the removal of nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula would not have been a good thing.
However, the tone of Ri's speech was significantly different from the previous year when he told the UN General Assembly that directing North Korean missiles to the U.S. mainland was inevitable after "bad president" Trump called Kim a "human-missile" suicide mission.
This year at the UN, Trump, who threatened North Korea with “complete destruction” last year, praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said there was still a lot of work to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea removes nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump stressed that there is no deadline for this and said: “It doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that: “The implementation of the Security Council’s sanctions must necessarily continue until full, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament has taken place.”
The Security Council has unanimously intensified sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to halt funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile program.
Pompeo met with Ri in the back of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip went well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, but only hours later North Korea accused him of making "gangster demands."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to destroy a missile facility and a nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures."
According to him, Kim told him that the “relevant measures” he aspires to are the security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and that he wants to achieve normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students on a course for enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year leads all students to sleep more in an attempt to combat the growing culture of learning “all night” with the help of caffeine.
A professor found that students at university number one in the world often don’t even think about the very basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Keysler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham Hospital and Women’s Hospital, prepared the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At last a girl came to me and said, ‘Why are they telling me this until now, in my last year?’
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is being held for the first time this year, explains to students the essentials of how good sleep habits help academic and sporting achievement, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Bareira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university had decided to introduce the course after it was found that students were suffering from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is an image of a dormitory room where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers, and books to explain the effects of caffeine and light, how sporting achievements are affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of a sleeping routine.
In another part of the study, participants discussed how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risks of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then a map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that this will not immediately change the behaviour of the students.
But we believe they have a right to know – just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke,” added Prof. Kaysler.
The culture of pride in “all-night learning” still exists, he says, adding that modern technologies and the ever-increasing pressure on students mean sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Providing enough and quality sleep should be the “secret weapon” for students in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he says – even to avoid overeating, as sleep deprivation puts the brain into a starvation mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond Sow, a 19-year-old student from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Keysler prepare the course by taking one of his classes during his first year at Harvard.
He says his course has “opened his eyes” and inspired him to spread it across the campus.
It is hoped that the next step is for all graduate students to be asked to complete a similar curriculum before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Kaysler recommends students to think about setting up a bedtime and wake-up alarm and to know the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm and lead to problems.
Livingston 1 – 0 Rangers: Menga's Goal Destroyed Gerard's Team
Rangers suffered another loss after Dolly Menga's shot broke Steven Gerard's senseless team and brought a 1–0 win for Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first win as a host of the triumph in February with 4–1 over St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team only suffered Gerard's second defeat in his 18th game as manager, which left his team in the wicket with eight points less than La Harbour.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers' team, devoid of constructive ideas, never seemed close to leveling.
After the match, Rangers took sixth place, and Livingston are now third, leaving behind the second Hibernian only by goal difference.
For Rangers, there may be additional problems, as side judge Callum Spence received a head wound after being hit with an object that was apparently thrown by the guests' fans.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that defeated Air in the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same eleven-year-old Livingston who scored a point against Harts last week, and should be pleased with the way his aggressive team was paring all the action of the opponent.
Rangers may have dominated the possession of the ball, but Livingston did better in the rarer cases when they owned it.
They had to score as early as the second minute when Menga took off with a touch of Scott Pitman against goalkeeper Alan McGregor, but the midfielder missed the good opportunity.
Later centering Keegan Jacobs from the foul found Captain Craig Hulkett, but his defense partner Alan Litgow diverted the ball away from the back beam.
The Rangers took control of the game, but failed to create anything meaningful in the last third of the field.
Alfredo Morelos definitely thought there should be a hole in the 15th minute when he faced Steven Lawles, but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers made only two exact shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily managed to hit Lasana Kulibali's head and Oviedo's weak shot.
Although Livy's 34th minute hit was surprising given the ball's possession, it was completely deserved.
The Rangers again failed to cope with Jacobs' deep centering.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who cold-bloodedly handed it to Menga, for whom it was easy to realize.
Gerard reacted to the break by replacing Kulibali with Ryan Kent and this change almost immediately led to the result when the wing handed over to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out decisively and blocked the blow.
Livingstone, however, continued to force guests to play in a home-friendly style of play, with Litgow and Hulkett constantly bounced off the forward long balls.
Holt's team could have increased their lead in the last minutes, but McGregor managed to cope with Jacobs' hit, and at the ensuing corner, Litgow shot his head past the beam.
Rangers reserve Glenn Middleton asked for a dozen at the end of the game after a fight with Jacobs, but Thompson again saw nothing wrong with the situation.
Yearbook: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
Page from our yearbook Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and BRIEF . . . the day on which the future physicist Johann Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that ultimately led to the creation of the device known as a Geiger counter.
A cornerstone of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become the cornerstone of pop culture when the 1950 film The Coronado Bells was released, featuring the seemingly incredible scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: “What, for God’s sake, is this?
Rogers: This is a Geiger counter and is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: “It certainly matters right now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name still lives on.
New cancer vaccine could train the immune system to ‘see’ foreign cells
New cancer vaccine could train the immune system to “see” foreign cells and kill them
Vaccine trains the immune system to recognize foreign cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and changing them in a laboratory
They can then “see” a protein that is common to many types of cancer and are injected back into the patient.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with various cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which trains the immune system to recognize foreign cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and modifying them in a laboratory so that they can “see” a protein common to many types of cancer called HER2, and then inject them back into the patient.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "stimulates the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, Prof. Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and “training” them how to target cancer cells has been used in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kenny West gave a speech in support of Trump, wearing a hat with the inscription “Let’s make America great again” while participating in the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kenny West was whistled at the studio during Saturday Night Live after making a pointless performance praising U.S. President Donald Trump and saying he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat with the inscription “Let’s make America great again,” he spoke out against the Democrats and voiced his support for Trump.
“I talk to white people a lot and they ask me, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s racist?’
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show featuring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Sexual Violence Complaints made by Christine Blaise Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of West's performance was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear why Rock tried to make fun of West with his publication.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had problems behind the scenes because of his hat.
“I was stunned behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat."
I'm being held back!
And then they claim I'm on a sinking ship," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continues, "Do you want to see the sinking ship?", claiming that she will be wearing Superman's suit, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try it with love.”
The comments sparked at least two whistles from the audience, and members of the SNL team looked embarrassed, Variety reported, telling one of them: “The whole studio is silent.”
West was invited at the last minute to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West puzzled many with the performance of the song "I Love It", dressed as a bottle of "Perrie".
West received the support of the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candes Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "To one of the bravest: THANK YOU FOR TALKING TO THE crowd."
However, TV host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply “he was himself and that’s great.”
“But I choose NOT to reward a person (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his ‘art’) whom I think he welcomes and spreads an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
That’s how we are,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, now "officially known as Kenny West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, and follows the example of Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and Pi Didi.
His friend, the rapper Snoop Dogg, was called Snoop Lion, and musical legend Prince changed his name to a symbol.
Accused of attempted murder after stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The accused is expected to appear before the Magistrate's Court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the prosecution.
"Game of Thrones" star Keith Harrington opposes toxic masculinity
Keith Harrington is best known for his role as sword-swinger John Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series of the NGO "Game of Thrones".
But the 31-year-old actor has spoken out against the macho hero’s stereotype, saying that showing such roles on screen often leads young people to think they need to be “rough” to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he believed “something went wrong” and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married his Game of Thrones partner Rose Leslie, also at age 31, admits he feels "strongly convinced" that the problem needs to be solved.
“Right now, I’m personally firmly convinced – what were we wrong with respect to masculinity?” he said.
“What do we teach adolescent men about the problem we see now?”
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to many male characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is taught?
What is being taught by television and on the street that makes boys feel that they need to become this particular type of man?
I think that’s really one of the big questions of our time – how do we change it?
Because obviously something is wrong with the young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in pre-history or sequels to Game of Thrones after the series ended next summer, claiming that he had “finished with the battlefields and the horses.”
From November, Keith will play in Sam Shepherd's "The Real West" remake, a story about a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor said that dating his wife Rose is the best thing that has happened in Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this series, so that’s how he gave me my future family and defined my life in the future,” he said.
Rose plays Gamerite, the girl Keith's character John Snow falls in love with, in the fantasy series, winner of the Emmy Award.
The two were married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Spin: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% jump in the number of people living with HIV and spin.
According to health services, more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
The majority of new cases are caused by sexual contact, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV is spreading rapidly in some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, China's health services said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, every year the number of people living with HIV and spin in China increases by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
In 1997, homosexuality was decriminalized in China, but discrimination against people in LGBT communities is widespread.
According to studies, because of conservative values, 70-90% of men who have had sexual contact with men eventually marry women.
Many of the cases of transmission of diseases are due to improper protection in these relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government pledged to provide universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaking data from Republican senators, denounces “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
On Saturday, U.S. House of Representatives member Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of her team had published personal information of three U.S. senators from Republicans on lawmakers' pages on Wikipedia.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the claims were made by experts and sites on the “ultra-right wing.”
"Lies, lies and more disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information includes the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, who are from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from the Capitol during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of immoral sexual conduct against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after the three senators interrogated Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts was linked to Waters' office, and released information about a member of her team, according to Hill.
"This unfounded statement is completely false and is an absolute lie," Waters said.
“The member of my team – whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false claims – is in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
This unfounded statement is completely false and is an absolute lie.”
Waters' statement quickly sparked criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleisher.
“There is poison in this denial,” wrote Flyscher.
“This suggests that she does not have the temperament appropriate for a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they have not done, they should not be angry.
You don't have to be provocative.
I don't have to question the motives of the prosecutor.
It has to be calm and balanced.”
Fleisher compared Waters's reaction to criticism from Democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of appearing angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican nominee for Waters’s seat in the midterm elections, also tweeted his opinion.
“Essentially, if it’s true,” he wrote.
In a statement, Waters said her office had called the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies for these deceptive allegations.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators will be exposed and that they will be brought under legal responsibility for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my team.”
Johnny English's Revue Explodes Again: The Weak Spy Parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now traditional to look for references to Brexit in every new British film, and it seems that this also applies to the revival of the action-comedy, spy franchise for Johnny English – which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English.
Will the self-laughing and the mimicry that speaks of how obviously stupid we are become a new opportunity for the nation’s export?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his curly-eyed and "gum-faced" face, is allowed to renew things a second time - his name is of the greatest importance when it comes to a great comical creation designed for film fans who do not speak English.
He, of course, is a stupid undercover agent who, despite his strange claims of flattering brilliance, owns a bit of Clouseau, a bit of Mr. Bean, and a large part of the man who contributed a note to the musical theme of Chariots of Fire at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
In addition, it was initially based on the chaos left behind by a traveler and an international man whom Atkinson played in the already forgotten television commercials of Barclaycard.
In the last film with Johnny English there are two good times.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter, wearing a medieval armor and for a short time the fins stuck in his helmet.
Atkinson's contribution to physical comedy is obvious, but the humor is rather weak and strangely superfluous, especially when "serious" movie brands like "007" and "Mission Impossible" include a dose of comedy.
Humor seems to be directed more towards children than adults, and Johnny English’s crazy accidents are not innovative and focused in my opinion, as Actinson’s lack of play reminds Mr. Bean.
There is always a presumption that the UK is facing serious problems.
Cyberhacker has hacked into Britain’s top-secret spy network and revealed the identity of all operatives to the horror of the duty agent – unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Elden.
This is the last drop for the premiere, who is a bloated and pompous figure and already suffers from a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her all for this quasi-Theresa-May role, but in the script there is nothing to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that she has to call some retired agent, as all acting agents are compromised.
And that means Johnny English himself, who currently works as a teacher in a chic center, but who illegally teaches lessons on how to be an undercover agent: here are some good hits when English recreates a spy rock academy.
English is summoned to Whitehall for emergency instruction and reunites with his former longtime assistant Bo, played again by Ben Miller.
Bo is already a family man, married to a submarine commander, a cheerful role in which a little wasted the talent of Vicky Pepperdine.
So, Batman and Robin are again in the game to solve the big problems of Her Majesty's secret services and face the fatal beautiful Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the dangerous influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Wallace, played by Jack Lacey.
English and Bo start their odyssey from farce: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they create chaos when they sneak onto the luxury yacht of the Volta; and English provokes real anarchy when he tries to use the virtual reality helmet to get to know each other.
All the laughs are certainly taken from the previous film, but since so cute and lush, here there is a lot more content intended for children.
Quite a mediocre product.
As with the other Johnny English films, I keep thinking: can’t the British film industry give Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour denies that they are developing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but to receive a salary of five.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical plan that would allow the British to work four weeks but receive a salary of five.
The party claims it wants company bosses to provide workers with the savings made through revolutionary artificial intelligence (AI) by giving them another day off.
She wants workers to enjoy a three-day weekend, but to receive the same pay.
Sources say the idea would "fit" the economic program and the party's plans to shake the country in favor of workers.
The move to a four-day working week has been approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “It is expected before the end of the year to be announced for a policy review.
“It won’t happen right away, but the four-day workweek is an aspiration that fits in with the approach of rebalancing the economy in favor of workers, as well as with the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party will not be the first to have such an idea. The Green Party promised a four-day working week during its 2017 general election campaign.
At the moment, however, this aspiration does not meet the approval of the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not in party politics and is not considered by it.”
Shadow Chancellor John MacDonald used last week’s Labour conference to unveil his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. MacDonald said he was determined to take power back from “impersonal directors” and “speculators” in utilities.
The Chancellor’s shadow plans also mean that the current owners of shares in water supply companies may not get their full share, as the Labour government could impose “deductions” based on established violations.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and set up privatization funds to transfer 10 percent of the net capital of private companies to employees who can accrue annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsay Graham and John F. Kennedy talk to “60 Minutes” about whether the FBI’s investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court by at least a week and raised the question of whether the bureau’s findings could cause some of the Republican party’s senators to run away.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelli asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“When I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, after that statement came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was decisive, unequivocal and unequivocal."
Graham’s voice, however, seemed uncompromising.
“I have an opinion on Brett Cavanaugh and to change that, a shocking charge is needed,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it categorically,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasius Ford.
“And no one she mentioned, but she could confirm it.
That was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and does it help to reduce poverty at all?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an impressive line-up of performers and carries out an equally impressive mission: eliminating poverty around the world.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will gather tens of thousands of people on the large lawn in Central Park, who will not only enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but will also get to know the true purpose of the event.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to perform a number of tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, sending a non-email to a world leader, calling or otherwise connecting to help raise awareness.
But how successful is a “Global Citizen” 12 years before he achieves his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a brilliant way to convince them to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called “cliticism” – people think they’re doing something meaningful when they sign an online petition or post on Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, urging many different goals.
It says these actions have helped world leaders announce commitments and policies amounting to more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and messages stemming from its actions, of which at least $10 billion have already been paid or collected.
The group believes that the insured funds have already directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include the “Power of Nutrition” established in the UK a partnership between investors and contractors, a commitment to “helping children develop their full potential”, which promises to provide Rwandans with $35 million to help them get rid of nedo.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a mere historical note,” Food Power Ambassador Tracy Ulman told audiences at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government has announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the CBI’s on his website asking, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
“Global Citizen” replied: It will be a long and difficult road – sometimes we will fail and again we will fail.
But as with the big civil rights and anti-apartheid movement before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mona are just some of the performers of this year’s event in New York, which will be led by Deborah-Lee Fernes and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use naval forces to “block” and impede energy exports – Interior Minister
Washington could, if necessary, resort to its naval forces to prevent Russian energy products from entering markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zink said, citing the Washington Examiner.
Zink argues that Russia’s involvement in Syria — specifically, where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government — is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to sell energy, just like they did in Eastern and Southern Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
“The United States can, through our naval forces, ensure that seaways are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that energy products do not reach the market,” he said.
Zink addressed attendees at the event, organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that presents itself as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He aimed to compare Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are the same.
“The economic option with regard to Iraq and Russia is, more or less, to stimulate and replace fuel,” he said, while defining Russia as a “one-numbered pony” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come at a time when the Trump administration is tasked with boosting liquefied gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, officials in the Trump administration, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says makes Berlin a “hostage.”
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion North Stream 2 pipeline, which will double its existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a clean economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s ardent opposition to the project is dictated simply by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position provoked a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, the German Industry Federation (DBDI), has called on the US not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
“Elizabeth Warren will take a serious look at the 2020 presidential bid,” the Massachusetts senator said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "take a serious look" at her candidacy for president after the midterm elections.
During a city council meeting in Hollywood, Massachusetts Warren confirmed that he was considering running for office.
“It’s time in Washington for women to come in and fix our broken government and that includes a woman at the top,” she said.
“On November 6th, I will take a serious look at the candidacy for president.”
Warren expressed his condemnation of President Donald Trump during the city council, saying that he “leads this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm crumbling to the bottom of my soul like Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren was outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Cavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
However, a sociological survey conducted on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren’s voters do not think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a study by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported this candidacy.
The sociological survey showed more support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent for and 48 percent against.
Other senior Democratic party representatives discussed regarding a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin points PTSD to Trak Palin at Donald Trump rally
Trak Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after recording in September.
He was arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my own son is going through after he came back is familiar to other families who are feeling the consequences of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are coming home with,” she told an audience at a rally about Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest an “elephant in the room” and said of his son and other veterans of the war that “they are coming back a little changed, hardened, they are coming back and wondering if they will get the respect that they and their brothers in arms have given to the country.”
He was arrested Monday in Vasila, Alaska, and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, included in a report of domestic violence and possession of an intoxicated weapon, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Vasila's police department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the challenge of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a judicial challenge to a new U.S. policy that refuses shelter for victims of gang and domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives from 18 states and the county filed a goodwill petition in Washington in support of asylum seekers and challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff’s full name in the Grace v. Sessions case, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed against federal policy in August, has not been disclosed.
She claims that her partner "and the sons of the cruel members of his gang" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected the asylum application on July 20.
She's being held in Texas.
U.S. lawyers who help Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers come to the U.S., as nations facing widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed the 2014 decision of the Immigrant Appeals Board, which allowed immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Columbia County attorney Carl Rasin said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal, and international law."
“Federal law requires all asylum applications to be examined on the basis of specific facts and circumstances, and such a ban violates this principle,” the report said.
In addition, lawyers argue in the report that policies that deny entry to immigrants harm the U.S. economy, pointing out that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary workforce.”
In June, Chief Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered immigration justices to stop providing asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
"Asylum is given to those who leave their homeland for persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political beliefs," Sessions said in a July 11 policy statement.
Asylum has never been intended to alleviate all the problems — not even all the serious ones — that people face every day, anywhere in the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as deaths double during search for survivors
The situation for the survivors is getting worse.
“I feel very tense,” said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming her sick boy in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute an ambulance carries more bodies.
Clean water is scarce.”
Residents are spotted returning to their destroyed homes to try to save something from their flooded belongings.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Harris, who suffered a fracture of the spine and shoulder, were hospitalized outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients are treated outdoors for ongoing secondary tremors.
His eyes fill with tears as he recalls how he felt the violent earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I think I was pressed into the demolished wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that he had come to the city with his family to attend a wedding.
“I heard my wife cry for help, but then she shut up.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Humiliation’ with ‘Propaganda Ads’
A week after an official newspaper in China ran a four-page ad in a U.S. daily about the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referred to China Daily’s paid publication in the Des Moines Register, the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections.
Trump’s accusation that Pecky is trying to interfere in the U.S. congressional election noted what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to pressure China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to run commercials to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war in which they level import tariffs between countries.
Experts from the U.S. and China said at the start of the trade war, tariffs in China were meant to strike exporters in states like Iowa that support Trump’s Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former long-time governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad writes in a commentary in the weekly issue of the Des Moines Register, “is currently doubling this harassment by running propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government has taken advantage of America’s respected tradition of freedom of speech and press by putting paid advertising on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, at the newspaper stand down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited speeches and you will not see a true reflection of the divergent views that the Chinese people may have regarding China’s troubling economic trajectory,” he said.
He adds that "one of the most famous Chinese newspapers avoids the proposal to publish" his article, although it does not specify exactly who.
With Kavanaugh's pogrom, Republicans push back women voters for midterm elections, analysts warn
As many high-ranking Republicans stand behind and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on several sexual assault charges, analysts have warned there will be a response, particularly from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions around the tray are extremely strong and most Republicans have already noted that they want to continue with the vote.
These things can't be brought back," Grant Raher, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse's Maxwell School, told The Hill about an article published Saturday.
Raher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Fleck’s last-minute insistence on an FBI investigation would be enough to reassure angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it either tomorrow or in November," Karin Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, said on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November is Coming!” during a demonstration in the Senate Corridor, as Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee decided to continue Kavanaugh’s nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasius Ford, Mic reported.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be excluded,” said Stu Rotenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
“People say the problem is already serious; that’s true.
But it can get even more serious, especially among women voters in the suburbs and younger voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, who often don’t vote because they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony describing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggest a response could follow if Republicans insisted on confirming the candidacy.
"This has become a big mess for the Republican Party," Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican Party's National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote, the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is on the bench, it’s about how Republicans deal with it and how they treat it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
Americans, however, seem somewhat divided on who to believe as a result of Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimony, leaning slightly more toward the latter.
A new sociological survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe Ford’s testimonials, and 35 percent say they definitely or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while 30 percent said the same for Ford.
Following Fleck’s insistence, the FBI is currently investigating Ford’s allegations, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh assaulted her in a drunken state when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her his genitals while at a party during her follow-up at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to attack Google and Facebook
The inventor of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee, is starting an enterprise that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds the open-source platform of Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people have permission to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokes that the intention behind Inrupt is “world domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the venture.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own “online repository of personal data” or POD.
It contains lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, which are accessible through each browser, and at the same time are all of them at the same time.
The unique thing about the online repository of personal data is that the user determines who has access to what information.
The company calls it “Giving Power to Personal Data.”
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company’s CEO John Bruce, is to invest resources, processes and appropriate skills to help Solid become accessible to all.
Currently, the company consists of Burners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, several developers who signed a contract to work on the project, and a group of volunteer programmers.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to make a full change or not when all of their business models are fully updated overnight.
“We don’t want permission from them.”
In a publication in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission is to provide energy for commerce and the ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had a strong influence on the debate over net neutrality.
Although Inrupt launched, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation, and Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely optimistic about this new era on the Internet,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Van: in memory of the priest awarded with the Victoria Cross during the First World War
Celebrating 100 years in the hometown of the only Anglican priest to be awarded the Victoria Cross for his participation in World War I fighting.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Van won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper without realizing that he had been awarded Britain’s highest military honor.
A memorial was unveiled on Saturday by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was "extremely symbolic" that the monument was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's medal-winning work.
According to the London Gazette on 29 September 1918, Lt. Col. Van led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense fog and under heavy shelling by artillery and machine guns."
He later attacked the line of fire and led the building forward with "incredible courage" before attacking an artillery cannon with one hand and killing three of the squad.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I could never do, but it makes me humble.”
He and his brother Dr. James Van put on a wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said it was "a great honor to participate in the parade" and added that "the kindness of the real hero is demonstrated through the support that will be provided to many people."
MMA fans waited all night to watch the Bellator 206, but instead got Peppa Pig
Imagine that all night you wait to watch the full edition of Bellator 206 and finally you can not witness the main event.
The program from San Jose contained 13 matches, including six from the main map and had to be broadcast live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 p.m., just as Gegard Musassi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK were stunned when the show switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed after building up to the early hours, especially because of the duel.
Fan described on Twitter the switchover of the children's animated film as "some sick joke".
"The government rules that at 6 a.m. this content is not appropriate, so the program was replaced with a children's broadcast," Dave Schwarz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, said in response to a question about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig," yes.
Bellator president Scott Cocker said he would work on planning meetings to engage viewers from the UK in the future.
“I think when it comes to repetitions, we can solve the problem,” Cocker said.
“But it’s six in the morning on Sunday and there’s no way to plan things so that the event can be held here on Sunday and there on Monday.
We're still working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, we received a lot of messages and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn’t that, it was government.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We will stick to five matches instead of six – as we usually do. We tried to give more to the fans, but we went too far.
It's an unpleasant situation."
Previous articleDesert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels ‘Lower’ Because of His Sexuality
Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling lower than everyone else because of his sexuality — but that’s what motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete claims that until he started high school, he didn’t realize that “not everyone is like me.”
In an interview with the first edition of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Lauren Laverne, he spoke about gay rights to give “hope” to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he began to be less interested in winning the Olympics.
The permanent host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, is in hospital for several months.
During his first program, Daley said he felt “less” than anyone else when he was growing up because “it wasn’t socially acceptable to like both girls and boys.”
He said: “To this day, the feeling of inferiority and being different from others are actually the things that give me the energy and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove it was “something,” he said, so he wouldn’t disappoint anyone when he finally learned about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became an active participant in LGBT campaigns and used his participation in this year’s British Community Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he does this because he is happy that he can live openly, without consequences, and wants to inspire “hope” for others.
The three-time world champion said when he fell in love with a man — American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 — he was “surprised.”
Dale married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but claims the age difference has never been a problem.
"When you're going through so much while you're so young," he first took part in the Olympics at age 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, he said, "it's hard to find someone your age who has experienced such ups and downs."
The two became parents in June and have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley himself says his “whole worldview” has changed.
“If you had asked me last year, I would have told you that I was only interested in winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
"My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Dale said his father could not have accepted that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets for the 2012 London Olympics – because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You’re not going to be with me, Dad, not even in the front row,’” he said.
“I held his hand until he stopped breathing and at that moment, when I found out he was dead, I finally admitted that he was not invulnerable,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I just knew that my whole life I dreamed of jumping at the Olympics in front of the audience at home. There was no more wonderful feeling,” he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song – Heather Small’s “Proud” – which accompanied him during his preparations for the Olympics and still makes him squeak.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m., British summer time.
Michaelson's lost form remains on the bench for the "Raider Cup" on Saturday
The American Phil Michelson will set a record on Sunday when he will play his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he will have to regain his old form if he does not want his record to be tied to a failure.
Michaelson, who participated in the two-year event for the record-breaking 12th time, was left on the bench by Captain Jim Furick for Saturday's "fourball" and "foursome" matches.
Instead of again being a major figure in the U.S. team, the five-time winner of major tournaments spent his day as a fan and in training his distance shots in the hopes of correcting his weaknesses.
The 48-year-old athlete, who even at the height of his career has never been among the most upright players, is not in optimal shape for the difficult course of Le Golf National, where the long uneven terrain usually punishes any wrong shot.
And if the pitch itself is not disturbing enough, in the ninth game on Sunday, Michelson will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who is on a team with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood and are aiming to win all four games this week.
If the Americans who score four points before the 12-match singles make a strong start, it may turn out that Michelson’s match is absolutely decisive.
Furik expressed confidence in his teammate, although he could hardly have said anything very different.
“He fully understood his role today, knocked me on the back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furick said.
“He is confident in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has given so much both in the past and this week.
I didn’t think he would only play in two games.
I expected him to play more, but that’s just how it turned out and we believe we made the right decision.
He wants to be on the golf course and play like everyone else.”
Michaelson will improve Nick Faldo’s record for the most games in the Ryder Cup played on Sunday.
This could put an end to his career in the Ryder Cup, which has never come close to his impressive individual accomplishments.
Michaelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven equal matches, but Furick said his presence brings other benefits to the team that are not measured by numbers.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to joke with people and he’s a great person for every team,” he said.
“I think the younger players were having fun with him, especially this week.
He gives a lot more than just playing."
Thomas Björn, the captain of Europe, is aware that the big advantage may soon be melted
The captain of the European team, Thomas Björn, knows from personal experience that the big lead accumulated before the singles matches of the last day of the Ryder Cup, can be easily eliminated.
The Dutchman made his debut in the Valderrama match in 1997 when the team with Captain Seve Balisteros led by five points in front of the Americans, but right on the final right was almost reached and barely managed to hold the victory by 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we also had a big lead at Brookline where we lost, and at Valderrama we won, but very hard,” Bjorn said, after the 2018 Europa 5 team won.
So the story has to show to both me and everyone on the team that it's not over.
Be ready for the attack tomorrow.
Come out and do what you need to do.
Nothing is over until you see the final score on the board.
We have a goal and it is to try to win this trophy and that is exactly what we need to stay focused on.
I’ve said all along that I’m only thinking about the 12 players on our team, but we’re also aware of our rivals, who are some of the greatest players in the world.”
Satisfied with the performance of the players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never be in a hurry with the celebrations.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow, individual performances will come to the fore, and this is different.
It’s great to be there with a partner when everything goes well, but when you go out alone, then you put your whole capacity to the test as a golfer.
This is the message that should reach the players: tomorrow you have to give the best of yourself.
Now you can turn your back on your partner, because he too has to give up to the end."
Unlike Bjorn, rival captain Jim Furick will want his players to perform better individually than as partners, with the exceptions being only Jordan Speight and Justin Thomas, who took three of four possible points.
Furik himself was on both sides of these great setbacks on the last day – he was part of the Brookline triumph, and then he was on the losing side when the Europeans performed the Miracle of Medinah.
“I remember every damn word,” he said in response to the question of how Ben Krenschau, the captain in 1999, led his players on the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but it would be good to make the same good start you saw on Brookline and Medinah.
When the advantage passes from one direction to the other, these intermediate matches are played under tremendous tension.
That's why we formed our line-up and distributed our boys as we want to try to do the impossible tomorrow."
Thomas is tasked with leading our counterattack and facing Rory McElroy in the most important match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Jan Polter will meet the other Europeans in the top half of the line-up.
"I chose these players in this order because I think it gives us the greatest chances of success," Bjorn said of his choice for the singles.
Germany postpones the launch of a new warship
The newest frigate of the German fleet was due to be put into operation in 2014 to replace the outdated Cold War battleships, but this will not happen until at least next year due to malfunctioning systems and the massively rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the brand’s flagship new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quoted an army spokesman as saying.
The vessel was due to join the naval forces in 2014, but the problems that arose after its delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships, commissioned by the Fleet in 2007, will replace the outdated Bremen-class frigates.
It is understandable that they will have a powerful weapon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – the latest frigates must be able to be used for up to two years before returning to docking ports.
Continuous delays mean, however, that the avant-garde warships — which are said to allow Germany to demonstrate overseas power — will be old when they go into service, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate frigate F125 entered the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of significant "software and hardware defects" that make the warship unusable if sent on a combat mission.
The software flaws are particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will be operated by a crew of around 120 sailors – only half of the crew of the older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it turned out that the ship was significantly overloaded, which reduced its efficiency and limited the ability of the navy to add future upgrades.
It is estimated that the 7000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice as heavy as the ships of a similar class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the cost of the entire project – including crew training – also becomes a problem.
It is estimated to have reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (US$3.6 billion) – out of the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
Problems with the newest frigates are becoming especially important in light of recent warnings that Germany’s naval forces are shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defence committee, admitted that the fleet was "actually running out of ships capable of carrying out missions."
The official said the problem has grown bigger over time as the old ships have been taken out of service but no new ones have been provided.
He complained that not a single Baden-Württemberg-class frigate could join the fleet.
The National Trust monitors the secret life of bats
A new study, conducted at a mansion in the Scottish mountains, aims to determine how bats use the landscape when hunting.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and will help guide future conservation actions.
The study by scientists from the National Trust of Scotland will follow the common bats, as well as the brown-eared water bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in key locations on the estate to track bat activities during the season.
Employees of the NHS and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using manual detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of callous sounds of bats, as well as what types they emit.
A habitat map and a report will then be prepared to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Duar, nature conservation adviser for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, e.g. the creation of meadows, as well as the best way to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the UK as a whole have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction activities that affect their shelters and lead to the loss of habitats.
A risk to populations can be from wind turbines and lighting, aircraft and some chemical processing of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, due to their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use advanced echolocation techniques to detect insects and obstacles along their flight paths.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens of great importance and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
The Trust has trained experts who conduct regular surveys, inspections of shelters and sometimes rescue operations.
The organisation has even created the first in Scotland and the only special butterfly reserve in the Threeave Manor in the Dumfries and Galloway area, which is home to eight of the ten species of butterflies in Scotland.
The landlord, David Thompson, says it's the perfect territory for them.
“Here at Threave, we have a great terrain for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, a lot of mature trees and a completed suitable habitat.
But there are still a lot of things about bats that aren’t known, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
He stressed that it is important to check for bats before real estate maintenance activities are carried out, as it is possible that the unintentional destruction of a shelter would kill up to 400 female and young bats, as well as destroy an entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy their shelters.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish employee at the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the community to help.
She said: “I still have a lot to learn about our bats and many of our animal species, because we just don’t know what’s going on with their populations.”
Ronaldo Rejects Allegations of Rape and His Lawyers Will Trial German Magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the allegations of rape against him as “fake news,” saying people “want to become famous” using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which publishes these claims.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping American Catherine Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is said to have then paid her $375,000 to silence the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In an Instagram video, addressing its 142 million followers, a few hours after the allegations were published, 33-year-old Ronaldo denounced the publication as “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said about me today is false news,” the five-time Golden Ball bearer told the camera.
“They want to be famous by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to gain popularity on my back, but that's part of the job.
I’m a happy person and everything is fine,” the footballer smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for allegations that they call "unacceptable publication of suspicions in the field of privacy," according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Shertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages in a size consistent with the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after the incident, Ronaldo fell to his knees and told her he was a "good boy" at "99 percent", but in the case he simply gave in to "one percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that they had had sex, but it happened with her consent.
Mayorga also claimed she went to the police and pictures of her injuries were taken in a hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial agreement because she felt "horrified by revenge" and worried not to "be publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old woman says she wants to cancel the deal as she continues to live with the trauma of the incident.
At the time of the incident, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer moved to the Italian giant Juventus for the sum of 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain 'will forever regret' losing car makers
Britain “will regret it forever” if it loses its status as a world leader in post-Brexit car manufacturing, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was “concerning” that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” he said.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of a no-deal Brexit delay could lead to job losses.
Nearly 150,000 vehicles were produced at the Burnaston plant – where the Auris and Avensis models are manufactured – last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My opinion is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will stop,” said Marvin Cook, Toyota’s director at Burnston.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have voiced concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement and how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, says it will close its plant for the Mini in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to the risks to the supply chain in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line works on a “just in time” basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers from both the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be problems at the border, which the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to wait more than a day to replenish its inventory at the Darbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production will stop.
Mr Clarke said Theresa May’s “chess” plan for future relations with the EU was “precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks.”
“We need to have a deal. We want to make the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to be able to seize that opportunity,” he said on BBC Radio’s 4’s Today programme.
“Following the claims not only of Toyota, but also of other manufacturers, we are absolutely convinced that we must be able to continue to provide successful supply chains.”
Toyota cannot say for how long production will be halted, but in the longer term they warn that the additional costs will reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately lead to the loss of jobs.
Peter Cuvalaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is the founder of the Unite union at the plant, said his members were increasingly concerned: “From my experience, I judge that if these jobs go away, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: “We have put forward a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU.”
Trump-Rosenstein meeting could be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s crucial meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed by another week” as Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh’s fight continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, links between Trump aides and Russia, and potential impediments to justice on the part of the president.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy chief prosecutor or not, and thus endanger Mueller’s independence, has fueled rumors about Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denies this allegation.
But last Monday, he went to the White House after reports that he would resign.
Instead, while Trump was at the United Nations headquarters in New York, a meeting with him was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would “prefer not” to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Legal Committee hearing, which was witnessed by both Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment – Dr. Christine Blaisey.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into Kavanaugh’s complaints, further delaying the Senate’s full vote.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “It’s not yet a date for this, it may be this week, but seeing all the other things that are happening in the Supreme Court, I think it can be postponed for next week.
But we’ll see, and I always try to keep the press informed.”
Some reporters would dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Broadcast host Chris Wallace asked about the reason.
Sanders replied that the rare press conferences were not due to dislike of the “demonstrative behavior” of television journalists, although he said: “I cannot say that I do not agree with the fact that they have demonstrative behavior.”
She then hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president is holding more Q&A sessions than any president before him,” she said, citing no evidence: “We’ve tested these statistics.”
There will still be press conferences, Sanders continued, but “if press representatives have a chance to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, that’s far better than talking to me.
We’re trying to do it often, and you’ve seen it practice quite often in the last few weeks, and it will replace press conferences once you have the opportunity to talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with visiting senior officials.
Independent press conferences are a rarity.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, with his eccentric and at times strange behavior toward the assembled journalists.
Health Minister addresses EU workers at Scotland’s National Health Service regarding fears related to Brexit <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The Health Minister addressed in writing to EU staff working at Scotland’s National Health Service to express the country’s gratitude and desire to remain in place after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter to those less than six months before Britain's exit from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to the costs of the established procedures for the status of EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: “In the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on leaving continued, with decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK government is also making progress in its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I'm sure this is a very uncertain time for all of you.
That is why I want to remind you how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond contribute valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, which is beneficial to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we would very much like you to stay here.”
Christian Abercrombie underwent an emergency operation after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie underwent an emergency operation after getting a head injury during a meeting on Saturday when his team lost to Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State's senior coach, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury had occurred just before half-time.
“He went to the sideline and somehow just fell there,” Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel handed Abercrombie oxygen to the sideline before it was placed on a stretcher and taken to the locker room for further examination.
A Tennessee state official confirmed to Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had undergone surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are still no details about the type/seriousness of the injury," and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a fellow with a college scholarship, is in his first season at Tennessee State after his transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday he made a total of five blocks before leaving the match, making a total of 18 blocks for him this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher coat of arms tax on the purchase of real estate in the UK
Under new plans from the Conservatives, foreign buyers will be charged a higher coat of arms when buying real estate in the UK, with additional funds to help the homeless.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters
The increase in the coat of arms tax will affect those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects an increase of over <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year, which will help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today the decision for foreign buyers to pay a higher coat of arms tax on the purchase of real estate in the UK, with additional revenue going to help homeless people.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters by promising more affordable housing and targeting high-income people.
The increase in the coat of arms tax will affect individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional revenue will help the government’s efforts to limit the number of people sleeping on the street.
The supplement – which is an addition to the current coat of arms tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and properties purchased for the purpose of bestowal – can amount to up to three percent.
The Treasury expects revenues to increase by up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
About 13 percent of newly built buildings in London are purchased by people with citizenship outside the UK, which leads to higher prices and makes it difficult for people who buy property for the first time to interfere in the real estate market.
Many of the rich areas – especially in the capital – have become “ghost cities” because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the coat of arms tax to help more young people own their first home.
He accused major construction companies of maintaining high property prices by plundering land but not using it, and asked Ms May to abandon quotas for affordable housing to fix Britain’s “home disgrace.”
Mr. Corbyn announced an attractive series of proposals for housing reforms, including rent control and an end to "no-wine" evictions.
He also wants to give councils greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I shared that I would like to dedicate my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of a better life for every new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
The UK will always be with open doors for those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
But it is not right for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, to buy homes as easily as the hard-working residents of the UK.
For too many people the dream of owning their own home has gone too far in time, and the insult of sleeping on the street remains too realistic.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead the team in Scotland"
Sunderland manager Jack Ross said his "greatest ambition" in his career was to be a senior coach for Scotland's national team.
The 42-year-old has taken on the challenge of reviving the club from northeast England, which is currently in third position in the First League, three points from first place.
He moved to the Steady on Light this summer after last season taking St. Mary's back to the Scottish Premier League.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I recorded one match for the B team and that was it,” Ross told BBC Sportsound.
“But I grew up with the Hampshire Scotland matches that I watched with my father as a kid, so I’ve always been attracted to the national team.
“But this opportunity would only open up if I were successful at the club level.”
Among Ross's predecessors as managers of Sunderland are names such as Dick Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
The former Aloe Athletic mentor said he was not concerned as the heir to such established names in a similar famous club, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, success at the moment will be measurable with a positive answer to the question ‘Can I return this club to the Premier League?’
Because in terms of structure, base and conditions, he is undoubtedly at the level of the Higher League," he said.
"It will not be easy to get back to the highest level of football, but I will accept that I have only achieved success here if I manage to bring the team back there."
Ross has been a manager for only three years, having spent some time as an assistant at Dumbarton and 15 months at Harts' coaching staff.
He then helped Aloe not fall into the Third Division and turned St. Mirren from a falling team into a champion in the next season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than during his career as a footballer at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mary's and Hamilton Academic.
“I was really at the crossroads,” he remembers the time he took Aloe.
“I really believed that being a manager was the best ground for me, including before being an active player.
It sounds strange because I did well, I made good money and I had some significant successes.
But being a player is sometimes difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with every week.
I’m still facing the same levels of stress and tension at work, but I just feel that being a manager is the right direction for me.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager, and now that I’m really doing it, I’ve never felt more comfortable in my skin throughout my conscious life.”

The ideal time for beer is 5:30pm on Saturday, research reveals
The summer heat has boosted the incomes of struggling British pubs, but has accumulated more tension for chain restaurants.
Groups of pubs and bars reported an increase in sales of 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent, the statistics show.
Peter Martin of the CGA, which compiled the statistics, said: "Due to the long sunny weather and longer than expected England's participation in the World Cup, in July followed a similar pattern as in June, when the pubs grew by more than 2.8 percent, but the restaurant did not show any signs of slowing down.
The 1.8 percent decline in the restaurant business in June only deepened in July.
Pubs and beverage bars reported the best results in their growth, compared to the downward movement of restaurants.
The pubs with meals also suffered from the sun, but not as much as the owners of restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and have a drink.
In pubs and bars, beverage sales jumped 6.6 percent for the month, while in food there was a reduction of 3 percent."
Paul Newman, from RSM leisure and entertainment analysts, said: “These results continue the trend we noticed at the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the off-site services sector.
It’s no surprise that restaurant groups continue to suffer, although a drop in sales of 4.8 percent on an annual basis can be particularly painful in addition to ongoing costs.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the managers of food stores, and only time will show whether the more temperate temperatures we experienced in August will bring such a desirable break."
Overall sales growth at pubs and restaurants, including the newly discovered ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand deployment.

One in five children hides a secret profile from their parents on social media
One in five children – some as young as 11 – have a secret social network profile that she hides from her parents and teachers, a study reveals
A study of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in fake Insta pages.
The news has heightened fears that material with sexual content is being published
Twenty percent of students said they have a “basic” profile that they show to their parents
One in five children – some one in 11 – creates a social network profile that is kept secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed growth in fake Insta accounts – a reference to the Instagram photo-sharing site.
The news has heightened fears that material with sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of students said they have a clean “basic” profile that they show to their parents while also having secret profiles.
A mother who ran into her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website found a teenage child who encouraged others to “rape him.”
A survey conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent Schools Conference of Directors (HMC) found that 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, with half admitting to keeping their profiles a secret.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: “It’s embarrassing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilid Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" at the Board of Athletics in Scotland
Eilid Doyle was elected to join the Board of Athletics in Scotland as a non-executive director of the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most accomplished track and field athlete, and President Ian Beatty has identified this move as a great opportunity for those leading the sport to take advantage of her rich international experience over the past decade.
“Ailide enjoys tremendous respect in the athletic communities of Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are convinced that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from attracting her,” he said.
Doyle said: "I have a desire to be the voice of the athletes and I really hope to be able to contribute and help promote the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200-meter and 400-meter finals at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, adding to his four Olympic gold medals, and is currently a regular commentator on the BBC, lost the ability to walk after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but I achieved a full recovery, I learned to walk again and today I do mobility training!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!”
An advertisement for a breast pump that compares mothers with cows, share online reviews
A company that produces breast pumps has shared opinions online with an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers with cows who are breastfeeding.
To mark the market launch of the expected “world’s first wearable silent breast pump,” consumer technology company Elvie launched a humorous music-video ad to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump gives to breastfeeding mothers to express themselves.
Four real mothers danced in a cowshed full of hay, against the background of a song with the lyrics: "Yes, I'm milking, but you don't see a tail" and "If you haven't noticed, it's not a vime, it's my breasts".
The song goes on: “Pump, pump, feed the babies with them, pump, pump, milk your friends.”
However, the ad, posted on the company’s Facebook page, caused online disagreements.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it downplayed the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
“A very stupid decision is to use cows to advertise this product.
“Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies take them a few days after birth.”
Elvie breast pump is collected discreetly in a breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “It is quite understandable that it is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, “So inappropriate advertising.”
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that she thought the song was "extremely funny."
“I think the idea is brilliant.
I'd buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
The drainage made me feel just like a cow.
It's a little weird, but I accept it as it is.
“This product is brilliant,” someone wrote.
Another comment: “This is a funny advertisement aimed at mothers who leave (often at their workplaces or in the toilets) and feel like ‘cows’.
It’s not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the group of women discover that they danced with the discreet pumps placed in their bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the view that many breastfeeding women feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, however, is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and is collected discreetly in a breastfeeding bra that gives women the freedom to move, keep their babies and even go outside while they squeeze out.
Ana Ballarin, Partner and Executive Creative Director at Mother, commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between lactating cows and dairy cows, we wanted to draw attention to the milk drainage and all the challenges associated with it, while showing in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This isn’t the first time Elvie’s pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the podium for designer Martha Yakubovski, using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been secretly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of children detained by migrants jumped sharply, although monthly border crossings remain relatively unchanged, in part because the Trump administration’s sharp rhetoric and policies make it difficult to accommodate children with guardians.
Most guardians are undocumented immigrants who fear they risk staying in the country if they wish to recognize a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential guardians and other adults in the family should provide fingerprints, and this data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who wanted to become guardians of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal records.
“Nearly 80 percent of those who are either guardians or members of the guardians’ family live illegally in the country, most of them foreign criminals.
So we will continue to pursue these individuals,” Albens said.
In an effort to deal more quickly with the registration of these children, the authorities imposed new rules that require some of them to appear before the court within a month of their detention, and not after 60 days, as was the previous norm, according to shelter officials.
Many appear in a video conference call, not in person, to present their case for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those who are identified as unsuitable for admission will be deported as soon as possible.
The longer children remain detained, the more likely they are to become depressed or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter officials and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Lawyers said this concern is growing in large facilities, such as in Tornillo, where signs that a child is having problems are more likely to be overlooked because of the scale of the site.
They added that moving the children to the “tent city” without giving them enough time to prepare on an emotional level or to say goodbye to their friends could aggravate the trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria urges U.S., French and Turkish “occupation troops” to withdraw immediately
In an address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the civil war that has been going on for eight years.
Mualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign troops were staying illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and “to them appropriate action will be taken.”
“They must be withdrawn immediately and without any conditions,” he told the assembly.
Mualem insisted that “the war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been forcibly displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight in this sacred battle until all Syrian lands are cleared” from both terrorist organizations and “any illegal presence of foreigners.”
The U.S. has about 2,000 troops in Syria who are mainly training and advising both Kurdish and Syrian troops against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 military personnel in the lands of the war-ravaged country.
Regarding the refugees, Mualem said the conditions were tolerable and could return, accusing “some Western countries of inflating groundless fears” that prompted the refugees to stay away.
“We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to contribute to these returns,” he said.
“They’re turning something into a political issue that’s entirely a humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be provided for Syria’s recovery until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to stop the war.
U.N. diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone at the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib provided an opportunity for progress in political dialogue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Mualem, however, stressed that the agreement had “clear deadlines” and expressed hope that military action would be directed at jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra front, who “will be destroyed.”
U.N. envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committee, made up of members of the government and the opposition, to draft Syria's post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
Mualem set out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "a review of the members of the current constitution" and warned that there should be no interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump will win re-election in 2020 unless — as many liberal viewers are likely to hope — his presidency is terminated prematurely because of impeachment and scandal.
This would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic end to a presidency ever!”
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the primetime rating has doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News had an average of 2.4 million viewers during primetime, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show was at the top of the cable television ratings, with up to 3.5 million viewers at dinners with big news.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” says Neil Baer, executive producer of ABC’s drama The Last Candidate, which tells of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack on the Capitol.
Nel Scowl, who is a veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
She remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told her that she would vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked, “Why?”
Ms. Scowl told me that he replied, “Because she makes me laugh.”
There's fun in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of Rowe vs. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite, and the good fortune of the world economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Still, the desire to be an informed citizen doesn't match that in six hours to watch a group of experts discuss Bob Woodward, who uses "deep historical information" as a source for his book "Fear"; Paul Manafort's pilot's jacket is a $ 15,000 (a "fear" from the Post).
I will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he does to make you feel like part of a reality show is give you a little bit every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive producer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, in regards to the changing players and the daily turnovers.
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're gonna be late.
When I contacted Mr. Flies this week, it was sunny at his place on the northern shore of Kauai, 80 degrees, but he had shut himself in at home to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not be separated from television, especially when Brett Cavanaugh had to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court depended on it.
“I remember when we were doing all those weird shows and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization,’” Mr. Flyce told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Investments are pouring into the most contested race in the early elections for a seat in Congress
It’s not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th district receives a stream of money, thanks to the reordering of congressional districts and hence two holders for the same seat.
The recently redistributed district in the suburbs of Pittsburgh has pointed to conservative Democrat Connor Lamb, who won his seat from another district in by-elections last spring.
Lamb is facing another titular, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, who is significantly in favour of the new 17th.
The maps were re-drawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district sparked a financial dispute between the main funding institutions of the parties, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Commission (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Commission (NRCC).
Lamb became famous in Pennsylvania after a difficult victory in the widely debated by-elections in March for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The position has been held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the county by 20 points.
Political experts believe that the Democrats have a slight advantage.
U.S. Considers Imposing Sanctions on El Salvador for Supporting China, After Retiring
Diplomats note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a heartfelt meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017, and also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners fired the management team from the Trump Organization.
Representatives of the State Department decided to call back the heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," Department of State spokesman Heather Nauert said earlier this month.
But sanctions were envisaged only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $140 million in aid from the United States to fight drugs, for development and economic aid.
The proposed sanctions, including financial aid cuts and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American state with its unemployment and murder rate.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity, which serves as a continuation of such a gathering last year, seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent the influx of migrants to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior management bodies had made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, effectively ceasing any discussion of sanctions against El Salvador.
Now Vice President Mike Pence has announced he will attend the conference scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the administration’s importance to the gathering, diplomats said.
All three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further stringent announcements or sanctions from Washington.
White House spokesman for Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to remain anonymous and participate in the internal discussions.
Their stories were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also wished to remain anonymous.
History of the study
The next move could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Mr. Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, and the report is currently significant evidence in the public register.
It is alleged that Mr. Mueller is directing his investigation into whether Mr. Trump conspired with Russia during his campaign in their attack on our election.
If the leadership of Congress is changed, it will turn out that Mr. Trump will have to report to this body just as he is preparing to face the electorate, as well as perhaps to a judiciary composed of his colleagues.
There are many unknowns here, and I do not suggest that Mr. Trump’s downfall is inevitable – not even that of those like him in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, must make these choices that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, as long as the West had defended him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the subsequent years of slaughter.
The course of history depends on such pivotal moments, and the relentless march of democracy is speeding up or slowing down.
Currently, the Americans are facing several similar knots of momentum.
What would we do if Mr. Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds in his hands the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since this newspaper reported that last year he offered to secretly write down the president and speculated that he was not fit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein announced that the story in The Times was inaccurate.
“How will we react if the new investigation against Brett Kavanaugh demanded by the FBI is not complete or fair – or if it is approved for the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the early elections for Congress if it forces Mr. Trump to take responsibility?
If we fail in these trials, democracy awaits it for a long winter.
But I don't think we're going to fail because I learned a lesson from Prague.
My mother was a Jewess from Czechoslovakia, who was taken to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light the Shabbat candles on that table, carrying a swastika.
With a legacy like this, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorance of the Rangers is optimistic about the clash with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians after Spain’s impressive draw against Villarreal earlier this month would give them a significant chance to move forward from Group D of the Europa League.
A knee injury did not allow midfielder Graham Dorance to play his first game of the season before the current 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes that for Rangers this result could turn into a springboard to greater achievements.
"We won an important point because Villarreal are a good opponent," the 31-year-old said.
“We entered the game with the hope that we could win something and we left with a point.
Maybe we could even win at the end of the game, but overall the equality seems a fair result.
They were better in the first half and we were better in the second.
We took a look at Thursday, another big night of our matches in Europe.
I hope that we can fight for the three points, it will be a difficult match because they achieved a good result in the last meeting, but I am sure that with the support of our audience we can give our best and achieve a good result.
“Last year was definitely difficult after everything that happened in the wake of my injuries and changes at the club, but now things seem to have moved in the right direction.
The team is good and the guys really have fun, the training is beneficial.
I hope that we will be able to use all our strengths to forget about last season and achieve the desired successes."
Women Are Worried About Their Retirement Savings
Despite the fact that the participants in the study had a clear idea of what care they wanted to receive, few people discussed this with family members.
About half of the participants in a Nationwide survey said they had discussed the costs of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10 percent have talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they haven’t taken steps to conduct this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's what you can start with.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care for you if you do not state your wishes in advance.
Discuss with your counselor and your family where and how you want to receive care, as these decisions can be a deciding factor in determining costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you with an idea of how to pay for these expenses.
Your decisions when choosing a financial institution for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a mixed life insurance policy with monetary value to help you cover these costs or self-insurance with your funds – if you have the money resources.
Prepare your legal documents: Deal with legal battles right from the start.
Appoint your health care representative so that you have a designated trustee to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you can’t communicate.
Consider also the idea of a financial affairs attorney.
You can choose a trusted person to make the financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your bills are paid if you are incapacitated.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your adult parent needs urgent medical care and travels to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Put these details in writing so that you are prepared.
“It’s not just about the financial aspect, it’s about who the doctors are,” Martin said.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make a plan."
A man was shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle while he was coming home in the evening.
The victim, about 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 a.m. British summer time, as an "accidental act".
The victim could not see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police are trying to attract witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, with the death toll expected to rise.
Due to the interrupted communications, aid organizations are unable to obtain information from the Dongala Regency, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the 7.5 magnitude earthquake epicenter.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some basic facts about Palu and Dongala, which are located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow beachfront on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Dongala is a regency that stretches more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coastline of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, which is an administrative region smaller than a province, has an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the foundations of the economy of the central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important for the province, but it is concentrated mainly in Morovali, on the opposite shore of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit several times by tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to data from the Indonesian disaster recovery agency.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongala.
The tsunami hit the western part of Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic "Pacific Ring of Fire" and is regularly shaken by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A violent quake on 26 December on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in North Sumatra triggered a tsunami wave that swept across 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coastline of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 quake hits the most populous island in Indonesia, Java, triggering a tsunami that collapsed in the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 rocks one of the Mentawai Islands and triggers a 10-meter tsunami wave that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Peddy Jaya Regency in Aceh, causing devastation and panic as people recalled the devastation from the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Strong quakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, most of them from the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists in a deadlock.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Trak Palin, the eldest son of Alaska's former governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of violence.
Palin, a 29-year-old from Wassila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in a domestic violence report and resistance to arrest, according to a report by Alaska State Police published on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin was detained in the Mat-Su pre-trial detention facility and under a $500 unsecured guarantee, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "innocent, certainly" when asked to plead, the media reported.
Palin is facing punishment for three Class A offences, which means he can be deprived of his liberty for up to a year and pay a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B offence, punishable by one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being heard by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference in reporting a crime of domestic violence and possession of a weapon under the influence of narcotics in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend says he punched her in the face with a fist.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016 when she linked her son’s aggressive behavior to post-traumatic stress stemming from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds Killed
At least 384 people have been killed in an earthquake that hit Indonesia's Sulawesi island on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications networks have been disrupted, with the number of dead expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia’s capital Jakarta.
On social networks, videos are rotated that show the moment of the collision.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in Palu when a tsunami hit the coast.
U.S. Attorneys Rarely Ask for Death Penalty for Suspect in New York City Terrorist Attack
NEW YORK (AP) — New York federal prosecutors are calling for the death penalty for Saifulo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terror attack that killed eight people — a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is said to have used a rental truck at Home Depot to carry out the October bombing of a bike lane near the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, plowing pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
To justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “deliberately” killed eight victims and “deliberately” caused serious bodily harm, according to the notification of intent in connection with the death penalty request filed in the Southern District, New York.
According to the court document, both charges can end with a death sentence.
Weeks after the attack, an expanded federal judiciary sent a 22-point indictment to Saipov, including eight counts of racketeering used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as an indictment of violence and the destruction of the ICC.
The attack called for “serious planning and intention,” prosecutors said, describing Saipov’s conduct as “terrible, cruel and perverse.”
"Saifulo Habibulaevich Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, An-Laurie Decade, Darren Drake, Ariel Erley, Hernan Feluci and Alejandro Damian Panuko.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York sought the death penalty.
The defendant, Halid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but was subsequently sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence in a federal case was carried out in New York was in 1953 – Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy and spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbek by nationality, showed no sense of regret in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, the indictment said.
He also asked for the flag of ISIS to be placed in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the indictment, consisting of 22 points.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "obviously disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"In our view, the decision to seek a death sentence instead of accepting a guilty and life sentence without the possibility of early release will only prolong the traumatic effect of these events for all concerned," said Patton.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutor's office not to seek a death sentence.
Conservative MP Says NIJJUL FARAZH Must Lead Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the army of the people" today, during a protest at the Conservatives' conference.
The former leader of the British Independence Party said politicians should “feel pressure” – as one of May’s own party members suggested he lead the negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bon, a Conservative MP, said in Birmingham in March that Britain “would have come out so far” if Mr Farage were secretary for Brexit issues.
But the challenge Mrs. May faces to reconcile with the deeply divided ranks of the party was underscored by conservatives supporting the stay, who joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain his compromise Chequers plan, despite attacks from Brexit supporters, supporters of staying and from the EU.
The Allies insist that it will make progress in its attempt to reach a deal with Brussels despite hostile reactions, and insist that Eurosceptics and Labour choose between its package and “chaos.”
Mr. Bon told the protesters with the slogan "Exit means exit" in Solihull that he was asked to "discard Chequers".
He pointed out that Mr Farage should have participated on an equal basis with the others and that he should have been given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have left by now,” he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: “I support Brexit, but we have to reject the Chequers plan.
Declaring his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be rabbinic.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bon rejected the claims that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: “The notion that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely false.”
Conservative spokeswoman Andrea Jenkins also attended the rally, telling reporters: “I’m just saying, Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and our activists who actually took to the streets and really helped us get elected.
Please stop "Chequers" and start listening."
In an open message to Ms. May, she added: “Premiers retain their position when they keep their promises.”
Farage told the rally that politicians should “feel pressure” if they plan to change the decision taken after the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s about the trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to change Brexit, and we’ve gathered here today to say, ‘We’re not going to let you get away with this.’
In an address to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of changing Brexit, feel pressure.
“We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country that helped us win Brexit, and we will never stop until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
At the same time, supporters of the stay marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city center.
A handful of activists had raised flags with the words "Conservatives against Brexit" after the group launched this weekend.
Labour leader Lord Adonis joked with conservatives about the party's security concerns when it opened at the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can deploy Canada’s IT systems and all of the technology and more, and more, for unimpeded border crossing, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren says he will “seriously consider” his candidacy for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "seriously consider running for president" after the November election.
Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrats spoke about her future during a city council meeting in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a staunch critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican Representative Jeff Deale, who co-chaired the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She is at the center of speculation that she could take over the post of Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Hollywood was her 36th meeting with voters at the city hall after Trump took office.
One of the attendees asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren said it was time for “women to go to Washington and fix our damaged government, and that includes women at the top.”
Arrested for the death of Sims by LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, said on Saturday there was a suspect in the shooting on Friday when LSU basketball player Wade Sims was killed.
Batton Rouge Police Department reported the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20, during a press conference at 11:00 a.m.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man seen on the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the University of the South area early on Friday.
"Wade Simms was shot in the head, which ultimately led to his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wade intervened to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted he was at the crime scene, had a gun and shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested smoothly and detained in the custody of the East Batton Rouge Police Department.
A 6<0xE2><0x80><0xB2>6<0xE2><0x80><0xB2><0xE2><0x80><0xB2> youth, who grew up in Batton Rouge, Sims played 32 games with 10 title appearances last season and recorded an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 bouts per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Louis Hamilton is getting closer to the world title after his team's guidance helped him beat Sebastian Vetel
As soon as Walter Bottas finished ahead of Louis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team’s guidance would play an important role in the race.
Bottas made a good start from the first position and seriously worried Hamilton while defending his position in the first two corners, allowing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vetel first made a pit stop and left Hamilton to deal with traffic at the end of the column, which seemed to be decisive for the exit from the race.
The Mercedes also made a pit-stop on the next lap and came out after Vetel, but Hamilton managed to outrun him after a bold maneuver and driving "rubber to tire", which forced the Ferrari rider reluctantly to take a run off the track to escape.
On top of his 21st birthday Max Verstappen started from the back rows of the starting grid and was seventh after the end of the first lap.
After that, he even led for a rather long period of the race, as he had decided to change his tires later than the others, which would have allowed him to be faster at the end of the race and eventually overtake Kimi Rikanen in the battle for fourth position.
He finally went for a pit stop in the 44th lap, but failed to catch up enough in the next eight lap, and eventually Rykonen finished fourth.
It was a tough day as Walter did a great job all weekend and turned out to be a real gentleman when he let me out ahead of him.
The team has done exceptional work to win the first two places on the podium," Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her claim that she had not circulated a letter from Christine Blaise Ford accusing Supreme Court contender Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford’s testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented on how what is happening in the Senate shows that people are “evil and disgusting and dishonest.”
“What can happen and the good things that happen in the last few days in the Senate when you see anger, when you see angry people and evil, and disgusting, and insincere,” he said.
“When you look at publications and distributions, and they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, has it spread from you?
Do you remember her answer... Did you play the document – “Oh, um, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't spread it."
Well, wait a minute.
No, we didn’t,” he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein sent the letter with details of Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh as early as July, and it was circulated earlier in September - but Feinstein denies this distribution had occurred from her office.
“I have not covered up Ford’s claims, I have not disseminated her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep my privacy and I kept my privacy as she wanted.”
But the denial was not well received by the president, who commented during the rally on Saturday night: “I will tell you that it was very bad body language.
She may not have done it, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court contender accused of sex crimes against three women, the president pointed out that Democrats are using the allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by all possible means.
“Look at the dishonesty, the shame, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to regain power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars returned for Friday's loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants, beating the Dundee rematch 5-3 on Saturday.
The Giants led early in the game with two goals after hitting Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bovillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowney equalized for the hosts before Dwyer regained the Giants' lead.
Francois Bushard equalized for Dundee, before Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's two goals solidified their victory.
This is the third win in the Elite League for Adam Keefe’s boys, who got off the bottom to beat Dundi in Belfast 2-1 Friday night.
It was the fourth clash between opponents this season, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's hit came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 assisted by Kendall McFaul, and then David Rutherford doubled the lead, assisting Boviller four minutes later.
It was a tense start, Sullivan brought the hosts back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Markart helped level up with the help of Cowney at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants lead before the first break, scoring a second goal for the evening at the end of the first half.
The hosts regrouped and Bushar again equalized the odds with a powerful knock on the door at 27:37.
Cowney and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time this game at the end of the second half, as he gave his best and consolidated the team's victory with the fifth goal in the middle but the last half.
The Giants, who have lost the last four games of a total of five games, are hosting Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
A flight attendant was killed to make sure hundreds of people aboard the plane could escape an earthquake.
A flight manager in Indonesia has been praised as a hero after he died, ensuring that a plane with hundreds of passengers on board managed to leave safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are unknown in a powerful earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami wave.
Strong secondary quakes continued to strike the area and many were trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues ran to save his life, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in the heavily shaking control tower at Mutiara Sis al-Juffri Airport.
He stayed in place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would manage to leave safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he decided it was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Indonesia’s Air Control spokesman, Johannes Sirit, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our hearts were broken when we heard about it,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands after the country's disaster response agency announced that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"We assume that the number of deaths will increase as many bodies are still under the debris, and many people cannot be reached," said the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
Waves that reached six meters devastated Palu, where a mass funeral was held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry aid and supplies.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute the ambulance brings in more bodies.
There is a shortage of clean water.
There's looting everywhere in the mini-markets."
Jan Gelfand, chairman of the International Red Cross Movement in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is fighting to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s a tragedy now, but it can get a lot worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country’s army: “Please work day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” said CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Now Air Niugini reports that one person is unknown after a plane crash in a lagoon
The airline, which flew a plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean, now reports that one person has been declared missing after it said all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
In a press release, Air Niugini said they could not contact a male passenger as of Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to track down the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, e.g. age and nationality.
Boats of local people helped rescue the passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
On Friday, authorities said seven people had been admitted to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, all of whom were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some of the witnesses thought that the plane had crossed the runway.
American Bill Janes, a passenger on the plane, claims that the plane went very low.
“That’s very nice,” says Janes.
Janes says that he and the others managed to run through the deep water to the cross to reach the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the stewardesses panicked and screamed, as well as that he had suffered a minor head injury.
U.S. naval forces say sailors repairing a nearby port also helped in the rescue effort by using an inflatable boat to pass people to shore before the plane sank into about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
According to data from the Air Safety Network, 111 people have been killed in PNG-registered airline flights over the past two decades, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any case.
Analyzer exposes the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor's office ended its statement on the case Saturday in a retrial against a man who was accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Rowlett of the U.S. Department of Justice testified for hours alongside as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone recordings to assemble the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Roulette said it had received location data from several mobile phones showing that Telis was with Chambers on the night of her death, contrary to his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to interrogate Sanford.
Sanford stood before the court on Saturday and testified that he was outside the city on that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Telis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said, "That's a lie because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency is that Telis said she knew Chambers from two weeks before her death.
Cell phone records indicate that they've only known each other for a week.
Roulette said that shortly after Chambers’ death, Telis had deleted her text messages, calls and contact information from her phone.
"He's erased her from his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin with its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be presented to the judges later that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip-Hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to evoke negative opinions about the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol argues that hip-hop has deviated from its origins of political statements and engagement with social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and re-promote conscientious hip-hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common are reborn in the UK through performers such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
New York babysitter sues couple after firing for 'racist' message
A New York-based nanny is suing a couple for dismissal for discrimination after receiving a mis-sent message from her mother, who complains she is “the next black woman.”
The couple denies they are racist, calling it a “extortion” request.
Lizzie Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, was stunned to learn that the new babysitter, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived for her first day at work in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE, THE PREPARING BLACK SKIN,” Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Mrs. Morris, and she sent it twice.
After realizing her mistake, the awkward Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Morris, pointing out that the former nanny, who was an African-American, was not doing her job well and that she was expecting a Filipino, the New York Post reported.
Mrs. Morris received a one-day paycheck after being sent home by taxi.
Morris is now suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal, claiming the $350 a day amount for the six-month contract she was initially hired for, even though she had no contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't have to do that," she told the Post on Friday, adding, "I'm sure it's discrimination."
In response to the request, the couple claimed they were not racist, adding that the termination of Morris’s employment was a reasonable action, as they feared they would not be able to trust her after they had offended her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you offended, even if it was a mistake?
You're the newborn?
Just think about it."
Similar to a request for "extortion", Plasco claims that his wife gave birth only two months ago and was in "a very difficult situation".
“Are you going to attack someone in this situation?
That’s not very nice,” added the investment banker.
While the case is still in the process of being examined, public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media, denouncing their behavior and logic.
The publishers of Paddington were afraid that readers would not feel a connection with a talking bear, reveals a new letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was accepted by the public, says of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it is published.
It’s a lot of fun now that we’re aware of Paddington’s huge success.”
She said her father, who worked as an operator for the BBC before inspiring himself to write the children's book about a little bear-toy, would feel optimistic about a possible rejection of the book, adding that he felt he had met the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book "smile.
With respect to Paddington, whom she described as “an important member of our family,” she added that her father secretly felt proud of the ultimate success.
“He was a very humble man and he was not alone,” she said.
“But since Paddington felt so real, it’s like having a child who’s accomplished something: you’re proud of him, even though it’s not really your job.
I think he kind of accepted Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed the merits to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors fought in vain to save her life.
"He was constantly calling to say that the situation was really bad, that he didn't expect to survive," said Edna-Laperuz.
“After that, Nad called me to say that he was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said to her, “Tashi, darling, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll come to you.
Medications given to her by doctors to maintain her heart, slowly stop working and leave her system.
She's been gone a while before that, and that's how it's all over.
I just had to sit there and wait, realizing that all this was happening.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to get cold."
Finally, Mrs. Edna-Laperuz, who still mourns the loss of her daughter, boards the plane with the other passengers who have no idea of the ordeal she is going through.
“Nobody understood,” she said.
“I was shaking my head and my tears were falling all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but during the flight I felt this all-consuming feeling of empathy with Nad.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Grieving women put up cards to prevent suicides from the bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones to suicide are trying to prevent other suicides.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put on a bridge in Wales cards with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, from Liddy, says her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him by his smile.
They have always said that his smile illuminates every room.
However, he gave up his job before he left and found himself in a “really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, found his brother after he took his own life.
Ms. Davis said: “I’m constantly worried that this will have some consequences.”
Ms. Davis created the cards, “to let people know that there is someone to go to and talk to, even if that’s a friend.
Don’t be silent – you have to speak.”
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, loses Mark, her companion in life for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed or depressed or anything,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He reached the bottom of Christmas – when the children opened their presents, he neither looked at them nor anything.
She said it was a terrible trauma for them, but they had to deal with it: “It opens a void in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we have to move forward and fight.”

Brett Cavanaugh's future is under threat after FBI investigates
I wondered if we could really achieve what he wanted – a limited-term investigation and limited scope – maybe we could pool our efforts,” Mr. Fleck said on Saturday, adding that he feared the commission would “disintegrate” despite the hardened supra-party blockade.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their unwillingness is because of the moment itself.
The early elections are only five weeks away, on November 6 – if Republicans are not expected to perform well, their attempts to elect their representative to the country’s highest court will be seriously affected.
George W. Bush called Senators, inviting them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who works for Mr. Bush in the White House, and with his help met his wife, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI prepares its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Cavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate that will allow Vice President Mike Pence to declare equality and confirm his candidacy for the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees is “decreasing” at Kim.
South Korean lawmakers say the number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Bieong Sug, citing data from the South Korean union ministry, said there were 1,127 refugees last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
According to Park, stricter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as higher amounts demanded by human smugglers, are key factors.
There is no official comment from Pyongyang.
Most of the refugees from the North eventually get citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run through China, where the longest border with North Korea is located, and is easier to cross than the tightly guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ), which separates the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the heads of state of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on a stalemate in nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This came after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they agreed to work on a Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho accused U.S. sanctions of a lack of progress since then.
“In the absence of trust in the United States, we will not be confident in our national security and in these circumstances there is no way to disarm unilaterally first,” Mr. Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Cavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was not fit for service in the Supreme Court
Congressional minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was too unbalanced to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on this during an interview this Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman had reacted in this way, they would have called her ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected claims that he had committed sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blaisey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his introductory speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times almost screaming and feeling as he discussed his family and school years.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him a “grotesque and coordinated attack on personality” organized by liberals who are dissatisfied that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he was not able to work in the Supreme Court, as it became clear that he was biased towards the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with these allegations and the way he's persecuting the Clinton family and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi denied when asked if she would try to discredit Kavanaugh if he was appointed and if Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
“If he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s unworthy not only to go to the Supreme Court, but to the court he’s in now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Washington Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential rulings on the Affordable Care Act or the "Roe v. Wade" case, as he was considered a conservative judge.
In the preliminary hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would reject certain Supreme Court rulings.
“Now is not the time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Isn’t it great?’”
And women need to master themselves.
This is a reasonable criticism, after months and years of spreading rage, and she cannot accept it without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s unusual, do you?”
She continued, “I got tremendous help from a woman who was the CEO somewhere who shared that she was crying when she was angry, but developed her own technique, thanks to which when she was angry and crying, she said to her interlocutor, ‘You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then it just goes on.
I thought it was genius.”
Tears are allowed when expressing anger, partly because they are misunderstood in the beginning.
One of my clearest memories of a previous job, in an office mostly with men, was how once, while flapping with inexpressible fury, a woman older than me grabbed me by the door – a freezing manager I was always a little afraid of – and she dragged me to the door.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be glad they did it to you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a yacht called "Monkey Business" and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason not to consider running for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me 30 years later, laughing.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they wanted to happen was to have another one appear.
Someone called the situation Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Because of her late involvement in the campaign, she lags behind in raising funds and decides she will not stay in the race if she fails to raise $2 million.
The battle was doomed to failure.
She realizes that some of her supporters, who give $1,000 to men, would give only $250 to her.
“Do they think I’m getting a discount?” she wondered.
During her speech, in which she stated that she would not continue with an official campaign, she was inundated with so many feelings – gratitude to the people who supported her, dissatisfaction with the system, for which it is so difficult to raise money and to be able to feel to the voters, not to the delegates, as well as anger against sex.
“One might think that I had a nervous breakdown,” recalls Mrs. Schroeder how the media reacted.
“Someone might think Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what would they write on my gravestone?
“She was crying?”
How the U.S.-China trade war could serve Beijing
The first shots in the trade war between the U.S. and China were deafening, and while the battle is still gaining momentum, a rift between the two countries will benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump launched the first warning salvo this year, taxing key elements of China’s exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation of tensions came this week with new tariffs affecting production of US$200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) with effective taxation of half of all goods imported into the US from China.
Each time, Beijing countered new tariffs with five to ten percent of U.S. goods for $60 billion.
China has vowed to respond to every U.S. strike, and the world’s second-largest economy is not expected to ignore it anytime soon.
To make Washington give up is to yield to demands, but to make a public statement to Washington would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Yet, experts say, if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressure from the trade war with the US could help China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a hasty political decision in both Washington and Beijing could create the conditions for an economic crisis in either country is actually more dangerous than observers have admitted before,” said Abigail Grace, an American security researcher at the Center’s expert group.
Syria is ‘ready’ for refugees to return, foreign minister says
Syria has announced that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for assistance in the reconstruction of the country devastated by the war that has lasted for more than seven years.
In an address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem stressed that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress we have made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas devastated by the terrorists to return them to their normal state.
There are now all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living there are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime would welcome any help in restoring the devastated state.
But he stressed that conditional aid or assistance from countries that financed the rebels would not be accepted.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, beating the US team with a 16.5 out of 10.5 at Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The U.S. has suffered six consecutive losses on European soil and has not won the Rider's Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the championship crown in the tournament after the team led by Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the necessary 14.5 points that guaranteed victory over the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mikkelson, who performed poorly throughout most of the tournament, took his first shot at the 16th hole (with a "pair") in the water, losing his match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari performed excellently in all rounds, becoming one of the four players in the history of the tournament to reach a 5-0-0 balance since the race took place in the current format after 1979.
The American Jordan Spite lost categorically with 5&4 of the player in the team of Europe, located in the lowest place in the rankings – Torbjorn Olessen from Denmark.
World leader Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England, for whom this is probably the last participation of the "Raider Cup".
Spaniard Sergio Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, a veteran with eight participations in the Rider Cup, became the European with the most points in the tournament of all time, increasing his asset to 25.5 points this year.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t hold back.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for calling me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I can pick up the bowl again.
The most important thing is the team and I am happy that I was able to help," Garcia said after the victory in Europe.
He handed over the batsmen to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated American legend Tiger Woods with 2&1 on the singles on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, yet I grew up watching him play,” said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and his overall Ryder Cup balance is now 13-21-3.
Strange statistic about one of the greatest players of all time, won 14 major titles – an indicator by which it is inferior only to Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed high-class golf on all days of the tournament.
US team captain Jim Furick said after the team’s disappointing performance: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
At one point this morning we pressed the team of Europe.
There was a fight.
I'm taking off Thomas' hat.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players performed very well.
We'll regroup, discuss important issues with the U.S. Professional Golfers Association and our Rider's Cup Committee, and look forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You can't take your opponent's hat off.
We've just been squandered."
