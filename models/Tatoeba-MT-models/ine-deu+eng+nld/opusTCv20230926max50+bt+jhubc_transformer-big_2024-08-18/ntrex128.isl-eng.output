The Germans are worried that they will “look like fl<0xC3><0xB3>n”.
Uggur is in some councillors because of a proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
Concerns have arisen over the plan to change the name of the council to the Welsh parliament.
Counsellors from all walks of life are concerned that it might make them go astray.
One member of the Labour Party said his party was concerned that “it rhymes with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers living outside of Wales: in Welsh, twp means fool and pwp means faeces.
An adviser from Plaid Cymru said the group as a whole was "dissatisfied" and had made other suggestions for the name.
An adviser from the Welsh Conservative Party said his party had an "open mind" about the name change, but pointed out that there was not a big difference between the word MWP and Muppet.
In this context, it can be noted that the Welsh character w is pronounced similarly to u in Icelandic.
The Council, which is now working on a legislative programme to propose the name changes, said: "The final decision on all the names of the members of the Council will, of course, be up to the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act (2017) gave the Welsh Council the power to change its name.
In June, the council issued the results of the public opinion poll that showed a lot of support for calling the council the Welsh parliament.
As for the title of councillors, the council elected the WMP (Welsh Parliament members, Welsh parliamentarians) and the MWP received the most support from the public in the opinion polls.
According to the news, councillors are now presenting other proposals, but it may be difficult to reach an agreement for the chairman of the council, Elin Jones, to submit a preliminary draft of the changes within a few weeks.
The Preliminary Communication on the Reforms will also include other changes in the way the Council works, including rules on the removal of members of the Council and the organisation of the Committee system.
Councillors will be able to pay final votes on their title when the debate on the bill begins.
Macedonians take part in elections on name change in the country
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the name of their country to "Northern Macedonian Republic."
The case was put to a vote in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long maintained that the name of its northern neighbours is equivalent to a claim on its territory and has repeatedly objected to their applications for membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who disagrees with the vote on the name change, has said he will not consider the elections valid.
Supporters of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have, however, said that the name change is simply the price that must be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The church clock of St. Martin sounds is the churches of Harlem have in difficulty
“The elderly people I’ve spoken to said earlier that they could find a bar and a church on every street corner,” Adams said.
“There’s no one there today.”
He said it was understandable that the bar will be reduced.
“People have other ways to meet” today, he said.
“Bars are no longer the hubs of the neighborhood where people come together on a regular basis.”
As for the churches, he is concerned that the proceeds from the sale of property will not last as long as leaders expect “and sooner or later they will be back in the starting line.”
He added that it is possible that churches would be replaced by apartments full of people who will not help to save the remaining shelters in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will become white," he said, "and will therefore hasten the closure of these churches in full, because it is unlikely that most people who move to these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem became the center of blacks – the Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870, and St. Martin’s Church decades later.
The original White Methodist Congregation moved away in the 1940s.
A congregation of blacksmiths who had worked in the vicinity took over the building.
The Church of the Dark took over St. Martin’s Church under the guidance of Sr. John Howard Johnson, who had the initiative to bribe shopkeepers on 125th Street, Harlem Main Street, who threatened to recruit or provide them with status.
The building was severely damaged in a fire in 1939, but members of Johnson's congregation made plans to rebuild it and also had the clock game built.
Sir David Johnson, the son and successor of Sir Johnson, called the game "the watch of the poor people."
The expert who played the clock game in July called it another name: "The Money Fund" and "a unique historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first clock game in the world that black musician Dionisio A. Lind played, but he moved on to a larger clock game in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin would not have had anyone else in his place.
In recent months, many architects and contractors have made their way to St. Martin, some recruited by church leaders and others from the diocese.
The Council of Churches - which oversees the parish and is appointed to church leaders - wrote the episcopate in July and expressed its concerns that the episcopate "would seek to pass the cost on" to the Council of Churches, even if it had not involved the architects and architects involved.
Some parishioners complained about a lack of transparency in the context of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old Boy Who Drowned a Lobster in California
Authorities say a shark struck a 13-year-old boy and wounded him on Saturday when the boy was diving for lobster in California on the first day of the lobster season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon’s Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy shouting for help and then rushed over with a group of others to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said he initially thought it was just a thrill to have reached the lobster, but then “it became clear to him that the boy was shouting ‘I was bitten!
“I was bitten!”
All the bones on him were torn up," Hammel said of what he saw when he came to the boy.
“I called out to everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” added Hammel.
The boy was transported by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is seriously injured.
It is not known what kind of shark the boy attacked.
The chief of the coast guard, Larry Giles, told a news conference that the shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but he was not of the more dangerous type of shark.
Giles added that the victim had suffered serious damage to the upper part of the body.
Authorities closed access from Ponto Beach Beach in Casablad to Swami’s Beach in Encinitas for 48 hours, for research and security purposes.
Giles said there were over 135 different species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s with a plan to hit the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury’s plans to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with shopping mall-style cosmetics and specialised support staff.
This is part of the plan to enter the UK cosmetics market, which is worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and is growing steadily as the sale of fashion and household goods is declining. Larger cosmetics stores will be tested in 11 stores across the country and will be installed globally.
Investment in cosmetics is part of a large-scale way to use shelf space that was previously used by televisions, microwaves, and household products.
Sainsbury’s says it plans to double its cosmetics range into up to 3,000 product types, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Current products from L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also have increased space with marked areas similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
The store also intends to re-sell its Boutique cosmetics range so that most of the products are vegan-friendly, but younger consumers are demanding it more and more.
In addition, the fragrance shop Fragrance Shop will be testing product stalls at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first one opened in Croydon, South London last week and the next one will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
E-commerce and the increased tendency of consumers to buy small amounts of food daily in neighborhood stores means that large markets need to invest more in order to get people to come to their senses.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said the stores would look more like shopping malls to a greater extent as the retail chain tries to fight the low-end stores Aldi and Lidl with more services and other products than food.
Sainsbury’s has set up Argos stores in hundreds of stores and has also introduced the history of a number of Habitat stores since both chains were purchased two years ago. According to them, it has increased sales and made the purchase more profitable.
The store’s previous attempt to revive its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments did not succeed.
Sainsbury’s tried to work with Boots around 2000, but ended up with a dispute over how to share revenues from drug sales in the major markets.
The new policy comes as Sainsbury’s sold its 281 drug stores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds drug stores, at <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Under the strategy, Lloyds will play a role in these plans by adding a wide range of luxury skin brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Marketing Director, said: “We’ve changed the look of our beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in special training for staff who will be on hand for advice.
Our brand portfolio is designed to meet every need. A welcoming environment and convenient locations make us an exciting beauty store that transforms old shopping habits."
Peter Jones 'alive' after Holly Willoughby quits <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Peter Jones, the star of the Dragons Den series, became a "living star" after television sensation Holly Willoughby canceled an 11 million-pound deal with his company to focus on new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for their homeware and accessories brand, Truly.
The company had been similar to Goop, the trademark of Gwyneth Paltrow.
Willoughby, a 37-year-old presenter in the series This Morning, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left behind Peter Jones, the star of Dragons’ Den, with a hard time quitting a popular lifestyle company at the last minute to focus on new and promising deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones has been the “lifelong” at a difficult meeting on Tuesday at his retail headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire when the popular TV woman admitted she didn’t have enough time for the household goods and accessories brand Truly’s all-in-one 1.5-unit worth of accessories.
The company has been similar to Goop, a Gwyneth Paltrow brand, and was intended to double the assets of Willoughby, but their estimated value is <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was planning to pull out of Truly, Jones flew from the UK to stay at one of her many summer homes.
A source said: “Truly was the longest on Holly’s list.
This was to be her future project that would earn her the next two decades.
Her decision to quit came to an open door for everyone.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so short that the line moved to the market.
There is a full stock of products at Marlow’s headquarters that are ready to go on sale.”
Experts believe that the removal of The This Morning Show, which is among the most popular stars in the UK, could cost the company millions due to large product investments, ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household goods, and possibly cause further delays in the future.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been friends with Jones and his wife, Töra Capp, for decades.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined them as chairman in March.
The couple spend their summer vacation together, and Jones holds a 40 percent stake in Baldwin, the company that produces television material.
Willoughby will be the official representative of the M&S brand and will replace Ant McPartlin as the director of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We don’t want to say anything about his business.”
It’s been a long time, and then we fell in love.”
He struggled with the criticism he received from the media, for saying something that many would consider inappropriate for the president, and for being so positive in the garden of the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump left so much behind?
Trump said and sneered at the voice of a reporter.
“I haven’t given up anything.”
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
However, talks on phasing out nuclear weapons have stalled.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, North Korea's top envoy, told the international leaders of the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that the North had not received "appropriate response" from the U.S. in the first steps of the North's campaign.
He said that instead, the United States kept up trade barriers for the purpose of maintaining pressure.
Trump was much more positive in his speech.
“We are very close to North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
Our relationship is great now.”
He said his attempts to improve the relationship with Kim had yielded positive results — missile tests had ceased, hostages had been released and the earthly remains of U.S. troops had been returned home.
He also took an unusual approach to discussing his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into a troubling stage, there were only 200 people standing there,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Floods and earthquakes in Indonesia cause huge damage to the island, hundreds have disappeared
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, international relief organizations were told that they were not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of the Lombok population had to flee their homes, an emergency was not declared, but it is a prerequisite for international organizations to have relief activities there.
"In many cases, they have unfortunately made it clear that they are not going to ask for assistance from international organizations, so this is difficult," Ms. Sumbung said.
While the Save the Children organization is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain when foreign aid workers can have jobs in the area.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the country's disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organisations should be allowed to assist in the relief work.
Considering how common earthquakes are in Indonesia, the country is sadly ill-prepared to defend itself against natural disasters.
Flood defences have been erected in Aceh, but they are rarely seen on other shorelines.
So it seems that the prophylaxis of flood warnings in Palu has further increased the death toll, even though a warning has been issued.
Even in the best of circumstances, it can be a challenge to travel between the many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make scheduling even more complicated.
An ambulance that has docked in Lombok to shelter the victims of the earthquake is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to get to the new crash site.
President Joko Widodo made it the main point of his election campaign to improve Indonesia’s low-cost transit routes and has put a lot of money into roads and railways.
Mr. Joko’s government has been plagued by a shortage of funds, but elections will be held next year.
Mr. Joko also needs to grapple with the ongoing tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have embraced a more sustainable religious policy.
Over 1,000 people died and tens of thousands had to leave their homes as the course of Christianity and Muslims fought in the streets outdoors with batons, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge, Liverpool player, equals against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League by scoring in the 89th minute of Saturday's game at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a transmission from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from the goal of Chelsea when his team was below 1-0.
He rolled the ball to the left and then tried to shoot a target towards the pole.
The ball flew high over the target and in the direction of its right corner.
The ball eventually went over Kepa Arrizabalaga, who jumped up, and into the net.
“I just wanted to try to get into this position, to reach the ball, and players like Shaq always play it as long as possible so I tried to create as much time as I could,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and touched once and didn't think so much about it, but just took the shot."
Chelsea were over 1-0 in half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
In the campaign, the Chelsea defender handed the ball with a heel ball to Mateo Kovacic and then bounced from the middle over to the Liverpool half.
Kovacic allowed the ball to pass quickly in the middle.
Then he sent the ball beautifully forward and sent Hazard in for a whistle.
Hazard ran off defenders and scored in the far corner with a left-footed shot past Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool play against Napoli in the final of the national team at 15:00 on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea play against Videoton in the UEFA European Championship at 15:00 on Thursday in London.
Death toll rises to 832 following floods in Indonesia
The death toll from the earthquake and flooding in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to a report from the country's disaster agency early Sunday.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the organization, said at a news conference that a number of people had been buried when buildings collapsed in the earthquake that occurred on Friday and was 7.5 points on the Richter scale. The quake caused floods that reached up to 6 inches.
The city of Palu, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, was roofed by buildings that had collapsed.
Police arrested 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman with an injection wound was found at 7:55 a.m. near Grayson Mews on John Street and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged people in the area to come forward if they saw or heard anything.
Brian O’Hagan, the research commissioner, said: “The investigation has just begun, but I would like to ask all those who were in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead to contact us if they saw or heard anything suspicious.
I would also like to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who might have achieved something on camera with their car cameras to contact us, because they could have important information for our research."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman who died lived in Birkenhead and that she was found inside an apartment.
This afternoon, people who thought they knew the woman came to ask where she was this morning.
The investigation continues and police say they are working to let the victim’s immediate family know.
A taxi driver, who lives in Grayson Mews, tried to get back into his apartment but police told him that no one could enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
Residents have now been told that many hours could pass until they can go back inside.
A police officer was told that the entire area was now considered a crime scene.
A crying woman came to the scene.
She kept repeating, “It’s so horrible.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police cars were in front of the marked area of the police and one car just outside it.
A number of police officers were present within the designated area and were monitoring the apartment buildings.
Anyone who may have any information is asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Crime Line anonymously at 0800 555 111 and enter the number 247 from September 30.
Cromwell’s support of the British Parliament is the latest memorial accused of “rewriting history”
The ban would be a poetic justification for the Taliban’s destruction of his superstitious Puritan companions on so many of England’s cultural and religious gods.
The Cromwell Society, however, said that Mr. Crick's proposal was "a trap" and "an attempt to rewrite the story."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the ongoing debate about the removal of shortcuts, it was inevitable that the shortcut of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster Palace would be for the battle.
The end of the English Civil War against cultural symbols was neither the precept nor the execution of Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell would have been wrongly sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the century before.
The splendid abbreviation of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, dates back to the 19th century and is part of the story of a man who many still believe is not worthy of praise.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more late in the 19th century than he is today, to have been a protector of Parliament against external pressure, in his case the Kingdom.
There is still a lot of historical controversy as to whether this description is entirely correct.
However, it is evident that the conflicts of the mid-17th century have shaped the development of our nation and that Cromwell is a well-known individual who represents one side of their struggles.
It is worth paying tribute to and remembering his accomplishments as protector of the state."
A pig fights a Chinese farmer and kills him
A pig attacked a Chinese farmer and killed him in a market in southwestern China, according to local news reports.
The man, who is only named by his last name “Yuan”, was found dead with a broken artery and covered in blood near a stalk in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, according to news from the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to inject a vaccine into a pig in a pig cage on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from nearby Yunnan County on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that the door to the nearby pork stall was open.
He said that inside the shield there had been a large gag with a bloody mouth.
A court investigation confirmed that the 250 kg gallon had killed the farmer, according to the report.
“My uncle’s feet were bloody and injured,” the cousin, nicknamed “Wu,” told Guiyang Evening News.
A security camera footage showed Yuan coming to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The beast that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his cousin.
The owner of the market told Evening News that the pig had been locked inside so that it did not hit anyone else while police collected evidence on the scene.
According to the news, Yuan's family and market owners are in talks about reparations for his death.
There are recorded examples of pigs attacking people, although this is rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in their home in Massachusetts and seriously injured their husband.
Ten years ago, a swine was squeezing 300 kg of a Welsh farmer with a tractor until his wife caught the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer ate one of his pigs in 2012, another Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that a bloody taste can arouse aggression in them.
“They’re just playing.
They want to hurt, and they're curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them respect," he said.
The remnants of the fallout from the Rose bring with them heavy rainfall over the southwestern part of the United States
As prophesied, the strength of the fallout was declining as it crosses a cooler sea off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will carry heavy rainfall that could cause flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rose became a Category 1 hurricane, with a wind force of up to 136 km per hour at 5 a.m. on Sunday at East Beach Time, and it was located about 600 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected to go north-east on Sunday.
At the same time, the formation is lowered across the Pacific Ocean and it will go east to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa comes to the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a heat wave will therefore accompany a large heat wave in the north-western part of the United States.
Roses will be accompanied by up to 25 cm of precipitation in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the heat wave will mix with the approaching lows and form a large and widespread precipitation over the southwestern part of the country in the next few days.
Local precipitation of 2.5 to 10 cm can cause dangerous flash floods, movement of soil and possible landslides in the desert.
A large heat wave will cause up to 5 to 10 cm of precipitation per hour in some places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 cm of precipitation is expected in some places in the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
There is a possibility of rapid flooding with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the spread of heat waves.
People are strongly advised against walking out into the desert when there is a risk of a heat wave.
Heavy rain can turn gusts into blazing floods and thunderstorms can cause thunderstorms and dust storms.
The approaching approach will bring a local outcrop to certain areas of the Southern California coastline.
There is a possibility of more than 1 cm of precipitation that could cause minor movement of the soil and neck on the road.
This is the first rainfall in the area during the rainy season.
Several distributed heatwaves will begin approaching Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before rainfall spreads across larger areas late on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread across four counties on Tuesday and will end on Wednesday.
We can expect large temperature changes in October everywhere in the United States, as the North Sea region cools down but the temperature is preferable to remain somewhat warm.
Sometimes this can cause large temperature fluctuations over short distances.
There was a very good example of a high temperature in the middle of the United States on Sunday.
There is almost a 7 degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, persistent summeryls will try to build up and disperse again.
A large part of the central and eastern United States is expected to warm up in October with temperatures around 25 degrees or more from the southern plains all the way to the northeastern United States.
Temperatures could rise to 25 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term forecast suggests that there is a high probability of above-average temperatures for the eastern part of the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people attended an interrogation of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people watched the thrilling testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, the nominee of the Supreme Court, on Tuesday and the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual offence that was supposed to have occurred in the 1980s.
At the same time, the political stance continued, and TV stations paused a regular schedule to release the latest news on Friday: Jeff Flake, an Arizona senior congressman, presented an initial call for the FBI to investigate the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was confident that Kavanaugh had suffocated her drunk and tried to undress her in a school party.
Kavanaugh said in emotional testimony that he was confident that it had not happened.
More people are likely to have watched the trial than the 20.4 million Nielsen said they had watched on Friday.
The company measured the average view of the television channels CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other TV channels showing the interrogations, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually has trouble measuring people’s views in offices.
To put this in context, this audience is similar in size and for the final match in football or the Oscars festival.
According to Nielsen, most of the interviews, which took place throughout the day, were watched on the Fox News Channel or 5.69 million. The polls of those channels have supported the nomination of Kavanaugh virtuously.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
There was a lot of interest after the trial.
Flake was the centerpiece of the play on Friday.
After the Republican Party's office issued a statement that he would elect Kavanaugh in favor of the election, CNN and CBS photos were obtained by the protesters when they called on him on Friday morning, as he tried to go into the elevator to attend a meeting.
He stood humiliated for a few minutes while it rained on him in a live broadcast on CNN.
One woman said, “I’m standing right in front of you.”
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
People said to him, “You have power while so many women stand powerless.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement and before the elevator doors closed he said he would speak further at the committee meeting.
The cable and television stations were all broadcast directly later when the Judiciary Committee decided whether to send the nomination of Kavanaugh to the Electoral College.
Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the charges against the nominee next week, but a minority of Democrats have encouraged it.
Flake was convinced in part by conversations with his friend, Chris Coons, a senior congressman of the Democrats.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with the Coons and several other senior congressmen thereafter.
Flake changed the vote because it was clear that the Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has authorized an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh’s allegations.
UK Prime Minister May accuses critics of “being in a political game” over Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "being in a political game" about Britain's future and evading the country's interests.
Theresa May, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, will attend the Confederal Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In a second interview, published alongside her front-page interview, Boris Johnson, her former foreign minister, presented the so-called Chequers Brexit plan and said that the proposal that Britain and the European Union be a customs union should be a "toll-free zone".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpsons in connection with the death of the LSU player
Police have arrested one suspect in the death of Wayde Sims in a deadly shooting. He was a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
The 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and jailed on charges of second-degree murder, according to Baton Rouge police.
The authorities posted a video of the conflicts between the Sims and Simpsons and said the Sims have lost their glasses in the attacks.
Police found eyeglasses on the scene and said they had found genetic material from Simpson on them, according to WAFB, a sister company of CBS.
Police say Simpson has confessed to interrogations for shooting Wayde and killing him.
According to his lawyer, a security deposit of $350,000 was made.
The attorney general’s office in East Baton Rouge County released a preliminary report on Friday saying the cause of death was a gunshot to the head and neck.
The authorities wanted to thank a special team of police in Louisiana, the crime investigation office of the police, the police at Southern University and citizens of the area for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU’s sports president, thanked law enforcement officials for their “cost and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The two-metre tall forward grew up in Baton Rouge where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
He scored an average of 5.6 points and took 2.6 rebounds for each game in the last game.
Will Wade, a LSU basketball coach, said Friday morning that the team was "sadly beaten" and "in a collision" due to Wayde's death.
"It's something you're worried about all the time," Wade said.
A mountain of fire spews ashes over Mexico City
The ash from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern part of the capital of Mexico.
The U.S. National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday advised Mexicans to stay away from the blaze after activity increased in the archipelago and recorded 183 cases of gas and ash emissions over a 24-hour period.
The center was monitored by vibrations and tremors from the volcano.
Social media photos showed a thin layer of ashes on car windows in Mexico City’s Xochimilco neighborhood.
Scientists have noticed an increase in activity in the volcano, which is 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake hit the central part of Mexico in September 2017.
The mountain, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police in the fight against Catalan segregation right before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence-minded protesters clashed with riot police and thousands took part in protests on the occasion of the first birthday of the contested elections in Catalonia to declare independence.
A group of masked separatists rocked the riot police with eggs and threw powder paint that formed a dark dust cloud on the streets, which were usually otherwise full of tourists.
Fights also broke out later in the day and police used calves to keep the troops in check.
Groups of separatists shouted, “We do not forget and we do not forgive” for several hours, while their opponents shouted, “Long live Spain.”
Fourteen were in need of relief due to minor injuries they sustained in the protests, according to local media.
A year after the referendum on October 1 was illegally condemned by the Madrid authorities, the independence movement has been intensified, but the Catalan separatists have been cheered.
The majority of voters chose independence, but participation was poor as most of those who opposed the separation ignored the elections.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were killed last year when police tried to stop the elections at polling stations all over the area, but this led to a conflict.
Groups of independents had stayed out overnight on Friday to avoid protests in support of the country’s police.
The protest took place, but was forced to go another way.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician, took part in protests over the divorce with his wife, saying he was no longer hopeful that Catalonia would gain independence.
“Last year we had some of our best moments.
“I saw my parents crying with joy over being able to kiss, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite having achieved the necessary but significant victories in regional elections in December last year, the independence parties of Catalonia have struggled to maintain steam this year, as many of their best-known leaders are either detained in voluntary exile or in detention.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old motorist who responded to the protests in support of the police on her phone, said politicians from both counties had encouraged the dispute.
“The tension is increasing all the time,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been jailed and asked for trial since late last year, announced that he would bid for the European Parliament next year.
"My offer in the European elections is the best way to condemn the repression in the field of democratic values and the repression that we have seen the Spanish government apply," he said.
Londonderry: People arrested after car was driven to a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after driving repeatedly to a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m.
Bob Blemmings, a research commissioner, said the gate and the building itself had been damaged.
It is also possible that the shot was fired from a crossbow towards the vehicle.
Menga scores in 1-0 victory of Livingston against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal wins for Livingston
Livingston, who came from the lower division, came into the open and Steven Gerrard had to endure his second loss in 18 games as the manager of the Ibrox team.
Mark Dolly Menga made the fortune and Gary Holt's team is now in second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team has not yet won the field in this season's Premier League game against the Hearts, who are eight points ahead in the top spot, next Sunday.
For that game, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the European Championship on Thursday.
At the same time, Livingston is still undefeated in the league with six wins, and Holt's head coach has yet to experience a loss since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston Loses Opportunities Against Wireless Guests
Holt's team should have been over long before it scored a goal, but their bone size caused the Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson managed to break into but hesitated in his attempt to score, and Alan Lithgow then passed after running through the defense to receive a beating from Graig Halkett across the goal.
The hosts let the Rangers play in front of them in peace, knowing that they could cause the guests problems in the right places.
And that’s how the important goal was scored.
The Rangers won the extra try and Livingston worked in creating market opportunities. Declan Gallagher and Robinson helped Menga in the merger, which took on the transmission and scored from the middle of the field.
At that stage, the Rangers had mastered the ball but the defense of the home team was inviolable and Liam Kelly, the goalkeeper, did not have to put much on himself.
This continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos managed to defend from Kelly.
Scott Pitman was stopped at the feet of Allan McGregor, the Rangers' goalkeeper, and Lithgow shot from the goal after a touchdown from Livingston.
Questions were constantly raised in the viteign of Livingston but were dismissed, and two demands for a viteign – for Halkett’s defense against his deputy Glenn Middleton, and one at hand – were dismissed.
Livingston's "Wonderful" - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland reporter at Tony Macaroni Stadium
Great performances and finals for Livingston.
For an ordinary man, they stood up brilliantly and continued to exceed all expectations in their rise.
Their playing style and teammates have hardly changed since they returned to the top division, but Holt deserves great praise for having pushed the team together since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Halkett, the manager was tremendously good and led a full-fledged defense, while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on toes all the time.
Rangers lacked inspiration, however.
As good as they have been under Gerrard's rule, they played far below expectations.
They went badly to finish their fights and only managed to open the half of the home team once so this should be a wake-up call for the Rangers who are now sitting in the middle of the division.
Erdogan gets mixed receptions in Cologne <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
There was a smile and a bright sky on Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met over breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between the two nations.
There have been disputes between them over issues such as human rights, media freedom and Turkey's entry into the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new, huge mosque.
The city is home to the majority of the Turkish population outside Turkey itself.
Police used security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but a number of supporters were in her neighborhood to see her president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many of them Kurds – also voiced their condemnation of both Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to invite him to the country.
The two protest groups reflect how contentious this guest is, but he is revered as a hero by some Turks in Germany and hated as a mercenary by others.
Deptford accident: Biker killed in car crash
A biker died in a car crash in London.
The incident occurred near the intersections of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, which is the largest street in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, at about 10.15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance provided relief, but the man died in an accident.
The crash came months after another cyclist died in a collision as a driver drove off at Childers Street, 1.5 km from the crash site on Saturday.
The police said she was working to identify the man and let his closest associates know.
It is designed to close the road and direct other bus routes and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six people injured in riots
Six detainees were injured when rioters broke out in a men's security prison, according to a report from the prison police.
Unrest broke out in Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire at 9:30 a.m. on Sunday at British local time.
“Tornado” special forces have been called to the area to try to contain the orphans, who are eight prisoners, and are only in one pen of the prison.
The guards were acquitted due to minor facial injuries on the scene.
A spokesperson for the prison affairs agency said: “Specially trained prison guards have been called in to deal with cases that are still in the Long Lartin prison.
Six of the workers were injured in the accident.
There is no violence in our prisons and we take it very clearly that those responsible will be handed over to the police and could be expected to spend even more time behind locks and slaps."
More than 500 prisoners are in Long Lartin prison, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was announced that the jailer had had to go to a hospital after a prisoner attacked him.
And in October last year, riot police were called to the scene to deal with a serious breach of peace, where employees with billiard balls were attacked.
Tropical Storm Rose threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flash floods (drying area could benefit)
It’s rare for a hurricane to hit Arizona, but it’s likely to be this early next week when the remnants of the Hurricane Rose hit the southwest, with the risk of flash floods.
The country’s weather agency has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and southern and western Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will head straight across Phoenix on Tuesday and arrive late on Monday with rain.
The Phoenix Weather Bureau said on Twitter that only “ten hurricanes have managed to maintain the strength to classify as heat storms or lows within a shorter than 320 km from Phoenix since the 1950s!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 km of the Arizona border."
The latest predictions from the country's hurricane center predict 5-10 cm of precipitation, with single precipitation of up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Precipitation is likely to be 2.5 to 5 cm in other areas of the southwest, including the middle part of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, with the possibility of individual precipitation up to 10 cm.
For those who are not in danger of landing in flash floods, the rainfall from Rosu could be a blessing as there are large droughts in the area.
Although flooding can cause great damage, some of this rainfall will have a positive effect, as drought is now in the southwestern part of the country.
“According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, at least a very severe drought is occurring in more than 40 percent of Arizona, but it is the second-highest category,” according to news from weather.com.
First, the fall of Rosa will land on the Baja California Bay in Mexico.
Rosa still classified as a fall storm on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 136 km per hour and is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and travels north-northeast at 19 km per hour.
The storm crosses a cooler sea in the Pacific Ocean and its power is diminishing.
He is therefore expected to land in Mexico as a heat storm on Monday afternoon or on Monday evening.
There is a possibility of heavy rainfall in some areas of Mexico, with significant risk of flooding.
“We expect rainfall of 7.5 to 15 cm in Baja California and into the northwestern part of Sonora, with the possibility of up to 25 cm of rainfall,” the company said in a statement.
Rose will then continue north across Mexico, as a heat wave, and then reach the Arizona border early on Tuesday morning as a heat wave. It will then continue up through Arizona and arrive in southern Utah late on Tuesday night.
"The main danger expected to be caused by Rose or its remnants is extremely heavy rainfall in Baja California, the northwestern part of Sonora and the southwestern part of the U.S. desert," the country's disaster center said in a statement.
These precipitations are expected to cause life-threatening flash floods and soil movements in the deserts, and landslides in the mountains.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with a knife wound in Somerset.
The youngster was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 04:00 a.m. local time on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where his condition is said to be “sustainable”.
One 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, according to police from Avon and Somerset.
The police have asked for witnesses who may have phone records of what happened to present themselves.
Trump Says Kavanaugh “Feels the Anger and Anger” of the Democratic Party
“A vote in support of Kavanaugh is a vote that rejects the relentless and degrading practices of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a meeting with supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh was “prisoned to feel the evil and anger” of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before the House on Thursday, vehemently denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusations that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified before the committee on his allegations.
The president said on Saturday that "Americans would have seen the genius and humanity and courage" of Kavanaugh on the day.
“A vote to confirm a Kavanaugh judge is a vote that confirms one of the smartest lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a gorgeous career record as a public servant,” he told a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke of the importance of Republican supporters participating in the midterm elections.
“It’s been five weeks in one of the most important elections of our lives.
“I’m not going to do it, but I’m really going to do it,” he said.
“That’s why I’m going to go all the way to fight for great candidates.”
Trump said Democrats were working to “deter and prevent.”
The first key vote on the floor of the Electoral College on the nomination of Kavanaugh should be held no later than Friday, according to an assistant to the Republican leadership in an interview with CNN.
Hundreds of people died after Indonesian earthquake and flood, and the number of deaths is likely to increase
At least 384 people were killed and many drowned when huge waves hit the coast, when a major earthquake and flooding hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when up to six-metre-high waves were raging on the beach at sunset, flushing people out at sea and destroying everything that had happened before them.
The tsunami was caused by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake at Richter.
"When the flood threat formed yesterday, people were still on the beach and were not fleeing immediately, so it was life-threatening," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster agency, told a news briefing in Jakarta.
“The flood didn’t come alone, it brought with it cars, a log cabin, a house, it’s going on everything that was on the land,” Nugroho said, adding that the flood had traveled across the open sea at a speed of 800 kilometers before it landed on the beach.
Some climbed a tree to escape the flood wave and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were transferred to 24 centres in Palu.
Photographs from the air, published by the airline agency, showed many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and unused bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to rage over the beach town on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes occurred in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Food and Technology Foundation said in a statement that the hurricane, which dislodged from a joint in the major quake on Friday, had been about 200 times larger than the atomic bomb that fell on the city of Hiroshima in the second world war.
The geographical location of the city, which lies at the end of a long and shallow river, could have increased the size of the flood wave, the agency said.
Nugroho said the damage was "serious" and that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of several victims were found trapped under a barrage of ruined buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and property damage could be higher along the coast 300 km north of Palu in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the source of the earthquake.
Communication "stays completely down and no information is received" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
“More than 300,000 people live there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the area.
“It’s already sad, but it could be much worse,” said the Red Cross.
The agency was criticized by many on Saturday for not letting it know that the flood had flooded Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived within the time the warning was issued.
In a video posted on social media, a man could be heard shouting from the top floor of a building to warn people on the street below that a flood was approaching.
Just a few minutes later, a tidal wave hits the beach and takes away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not confirm the video immediately.
The earthquake and flood caused a power outage that hindered communication in Palu and made it difficult for authorities to organise relief work.
The army has begun sending planes with relief products from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, but people, who have been helped by the region, still need to keep on food and other necessities.
The city’s airport has only been reopened for relief operations and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is due to visit the refugee camps in Palu on Sunday.
More than 800 people have died in the aftermath of the floods in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
The staff of World Vision from Donggala has reached the whole and sheltered to the city of Palu, where it seeks shelter in the camp cities that were set up in the park outside their offices. Destruction blasted at them on the way, according to Mr. Doseba.
“People said they’ve seen a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
The situation is very bad.
Helpdesk teams have started difficult relief work, but some have complained that foreign helpdesk personnel with extensive expertise would be prevented from travelling to Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies and personnel may only begin to arrive if the accident area is an over-informed crash site.
It has not been done yet.
"This is still a local accident zone," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government has declared that this is a hamlet area, we can open up foreign aid, but no statement has yet been made."
When the second night fell over Palu after the earthquake and flood on Friday, their friends and families, who are still missing, kept hoping that their loved ones would become one of the miracle stories that cast hope on the devastating episodes that followed.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from the boat.
On Sunday, aid workers rescued a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days with the body of her mother by her side.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian scuba team, had been the coach of two now-missing scuba divers for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who were locked inside the Roa Roa hotel were his students, including Mr. Monday.
“As a man with long experience in diving, I have my own emotional burden to bear,” he said.
Mr. Gendon said that hours after news reached the diving group that the Roa Roa hotel had crashed, he had sent a WhatsApp message in despair to the competitors who stayed in Palu and participated in the beach festival.
His message, however, showed only a grey sign, instead of a blue one.
“I think that meant the message wasn’t received,” he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 at Newport on the Levee ATM
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was filling up a bank in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from Newport police.
The driver of the car had been emptying the ATM in the entertainment area and was about to fill up more money on it, Dennis McCarthy, a police official, said in a statement.
While he was at work, another man "running behind Brink's employee" stole a purse intended for delivery.
Witnesses saw many suspects fleeing the scene, according to the report, but the police did not say how many were involved in the case.
Those who may have information about the suspects are asked to contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West plans to change his name to Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday and wrote: "Veran who was previously known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been called Ye for some time and used the name as the title of his eighth album which was released in June.
The change comes before his participation in the Saturday Night Live show where he is expected to announce his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces Ariona Grandi in the show, but she dropped out of the show for "emotional reasons," the show's producer said.
West has previously said that this name has a religious meaning for him, but there is also an abbreviation for his current name.
“I think ‘yes’ is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you,’” West said earlier this year when he discussed the name on his record with Big Boy.
“So I’m you, I’m us, this is us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, and to just Ye - to be just a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
It’s a reflection of who we are.”
He’s one of the many celebrities who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he would rather be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, a former West associate, has also written his name both with and without a dash and caption.
Mexico’s President-elect: Don’t use military against the general public
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, has vowed never to use military power against ordinary citizens, now the silent country will soon commemorate the 50th anniversary of the bloody anniversary of the students.
On Saturday at Tlatelolco Square, Lopez Obrador vowed to "never use the military to crush the Mexican people."
Soldiers fired at a peaceful protest march in the square on October 2, 1968, dropping up to 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were shooting down roots throughout Roman America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to help young people in Mexico by giving all students monthly strength and opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and a lack of learning opportunities have attracted young people to rape.
The U.S. should double its funding for artificial intelligence.
Now that China is becoming more proactive in the use of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its funding for research in this field, says inventor and artificial intelligence user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were made after different divisions of the U.S. government issued notifications of artificial intelligence, even though the U.S. does not have a formal overall artificial intelligence program.
China, on the other hand, announced its plan last year: it aims to be in the first place in innovation with artificial intelligence by 2030.
“It would be a good start to double the funding that goes into artificial intelligence research, given that all other countries are so much further behind the United States, and we’re looking forward to seeing the next big discovery in the field of artificial intelligence,” Lee said.
A doubling of funding could double the chances of the next major artificial intelligence discovery being made in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, the author of the book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” published this month by publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of the leading artificial intelligence companies.
He worked in artificial intelligence in the 1990s at Carnegie Mellon University, which won the U.S. Best Actor in Othello, and later served as CEO of Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese Department of Google.
Lee talked about the previous technology competitions held by the U.S. authorities, such as the Defense Department's robotics competition, and asked when the next competition would be held, to keep an eye on the next entrepreneurs.
Scientists in the U.S. often have to put a lot of effort into getting government support, Lee said.
“It’s not China that’s turning to its main ideas, it’s the companies,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have advised their students to work on artificial intelligence in the past few years.
Lee said changes to immigration policies could also help the U.S. bolster its artificial intelligence research.
“I think those who have a doctorate in artificial intelligence should get a residence permit automatically,” he said.
The Chinese parliament released its plan for a future bipartisanship in July 2017.
China’s natural sciences institution provides funding to people who work at university institutions, similar to the National Science Foundation and similar public institutions do in the United States, but the quality of scientific work is worse in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up an artificial intelligence center, which is intended to work with both industry and educational institutions, and the White House announced the formation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that it had invested $2 billion in a project called AI Next.
As for NSF, it invests over $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, the US legislation, which was intended to create a security council on artificial intelligence, has not gone on for many months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country
Macedonians voted in a national referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to "The Republic of North Macedonia" in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has closed on their application for membership.
Greece has a province named Macedonia and maintains that the name of its northern neighbours is equivalent to the requirement on their territory and therefore refuses them to enter NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the identity of the majority of Macedonians of Slavic origin.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not participate in the vote and a campaign to deny it has raised doubts that participation will reach the 50 percent minimum necessary for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ballot paper is this: “Will NATO and the EU go ahead by adopting the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say this is a fair fee for Macedonia to join alliances such as the EU and NATO, but the country is one of those formed after the fall of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country for the young people of Macedonia so that it can live freely under the protection of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result is not legally binding, enough parliamentarians have said that they will follow it and bind it into law.
The name change would require the approval of two-thirds of the House.
The election committee said nothing unusual had been reported at 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko paid their vote in the referendum in Macedonia on whether to change the name of the country, which would pave its way into NATO and the European Union, in September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, worked to prepare a small area and set up chairs in front of tents that had been erected by those who would deny the vote.
“We are a victim of NATO and the EU, but we want to become members with our heads high, not go through the services,” Kavardarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we live on the rise.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to China or Russia and become part of the Eurasian Union.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring the necessary funding to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
"I believe that the largest majority will accept that over 80 percent of the country's population is ousted by the EU and NATO," Zaev said after having paid his vote.
He said the agreement would be “confirmation of our future.”
An opinion poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Policy Research Agency showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum, but it is lower than the minimum required.
A second poll by Telma TV showed that 57 percent of respondents intended to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said they would say yes.
So that the voter turnout is considered valid, the attendance must be 50 percent plus one vote.
If the vote is not approved, it could mean the first serious blow to the policy of the government, which has been swayed by the West, since it adopted in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City player, passes through all the defences of Brighton and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defended Brighton in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentinean army received a shipment in the middle of the field at the beginning of the raid.
He jumped past three Brighton defenders and then went out to the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green-clad defenders.
He passed one defender and then ran off a few more in addition to the victorious Brighton.
Then he sent to the left and found Sterling there.
The English forward used the first touch within the victories to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to play Mathew Ryan, Brighton's goalkeeper, with a shot to the right side of the goal.
“Aguero is in some foot trouble,” Pep Guardiola, City’s chief executive, told reporters.
“We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
Then it happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the moment.”
But it was Sterling who gave them the blue first goal in the league game.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero was sent far inside the half-mast of Brighton in that raid.
He sent a gorgeous long ball to Leroy Sane's left.
Sane kicked the ball several times and then sent Sterling towards the remote pole.
President City sent the ball into the net just before it ran out.
City play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League at 12.55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Necker Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a knockout game against the Rockies
Since the Nationals team has been excluded from playing in the finals, there was not much reason to force another start.
But the insidious Scherzer hopes to get to pitch on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a chance to make it to the final, but they are just a game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Division.
The Rockies got at least a wildcard seat with their 5-2 victory at the Nationals on Friday night, but the team is still trying to reach their first league title.
“Even if we play for free, we can at least play for the electric atmosphere in Denver, plus what the team met on for sure after playing their best game of the year.
“Why wouldn’t I want to compete in such a situation?”
The Nationals are yet to announce who will be the first pitcher in Sunday's game, but it is believed that they let Scherzer pitch under these circumstances.
Scherzer, who was starting the game for the 34th time, took a practice run on Thursday and would throw on Sunday, which is usually his Sabbath.
This Washington right-handed pitcher is 18-7 with 2.53 ERAs and 300 winds in 220 2/3 rounds during this season.
Trump to visit West Virginia <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The president referred directly to the case surrounding Kavanaugh, the nominee of the Supreme Court, when he spoke of the importance of Republican supporters participating in the midterm elections.
“It’s all in November.
It's five weeks into one of the most important elections of our lives.
These are some of those big, big... I don’t bid, but I do, and that’s why I’m going across the board to fight for great contenders,” he said.
Trump went on to say, “You see this horrible, rotten bunch of Democrats, you can see it happening now.
And they are determined to regain power by whatever means necessary, you see the cruelty, the evil.
They don’t care who they hurt, over whom they need to go to gain power and control, they just want to get power and control, we don’t give it to them.
He said the Democrats were working to “shut up and stop.”
"And it's been seen for the last four days," he said, saying Democrats are "angry and evil and ugly and untrue."
He named Dianne Feinstein, the Democratic leader of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and was answered with a loud clamor from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Was it you who leaked the document?
Ha, what.
No, look no. I waited for one... it was really bad physical activity, the worst I've ever seen."
The Church is no longer a member of the Church.
He does not tolerate those who express their thoughts.
When the action Momentum in my category chose to give me a recommendation, it hardly came as a surprise.
After all, I am the last of the many members of parliament of the Labour Party who have been told that we are not welcome, just to express our thoughts.
Joan Ryan, my colleague, received similar treatment because she strongly objected to prejudices against the Jews.
In my case, the proposal to grant me a warrant came about because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The issues were the importance of having a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, eloquently similar issues and Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the meeting for Nottingham East on Friday said that “we want the meetings to be non-external and effective.”
In my eight-year career as a member of the Labour Party, Friday’s meetings have mostly been just that.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings today and the promise of a “milder and better” policy has been forgotten, if it ever began.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not over in the Labour Party and that all views are judged according to whether the leaders of the party consider them reasonable.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues, whom I previously thought had similar political views as I did, began to expect me to make a complete reversal and back up views that I had never agreed on before, whether or not the EU agreed.
Every time I speak publicly - and then it doesn't matter what I say - there is a scathing social media scene called after my departure, central politics denied and told me that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it’s not just my experience.
I know I’m luckier than some of my colleagues, as most of the comments I get are usually political.
I admire the professionalism and affirmation of those who need to endure the holocaust of sexual or prejudiced abuse on a daily basis but never give up.
One of the most disappointing things about this political period is how attacks and insults have become a normal part of everyday life.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should cling to a submissive culture.
The reality is that we are no longer tolerant of the Church and with each distrust or change in the rules of choice, the class becomes narrower.
I’ve been given a lot of advice over the last two years about letting myself get bored, not have too loud and then it would be “all right” with me.
But I didn’t want to be involved in politics to do that.
Since I became a member of the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, encouraged by the neglect of the Thatcher government that left my schoolroom in humiliation, I have fought for better public service for those who need it most to hold, whether in government or not.
I’ve never been able to express my views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can be in any doubt about my policy views and where I disagree with current leaders.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I just want to say that once the country heads into Brexit, which will hurt our homes, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy in my allegiance to the leaders of the Labour Party.
But my only message, which I would like to send from myself, is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to those within my constituency, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I serve you with pride and I promise that no threat of deviation or political withdrawal will be the best thing I can do.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unconquered team Ayr goes to the top
Two late touchdowns could have upset the final score somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr had the victory won in this imminent game of the day in the Tennent's Premiership division.
They are now at the top of the list and the only team out of ten that is still undefeated.
Ultimately, it was their stronger defense and better use of opportunities that made the locals a winner and Peter Murchie coach had every right to be happy.
“We’ve had tough opposition in our games so far and we’re still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Ayr to praise, they used their opportunity better than us,"
Mark Grant Anderson crossed Ayr in the 14th minute after Frazier Climo turned the charge, but a yellow card on the Scottish front, which was allowed to play the game with the Warriors, allowed Melrose to let the numbers speak and Jason Baggot managed to score touchdowns.
Climo led Ayr with victories before scoring with a kick just before halftime and then touching goal and came over Ayr 17-5 in halftime.
But Melrose started the second half of the match and Patrick Anderson's touchdown, after Baggot turned the charge, reduced the goal by five points.
Dora then needed a long play break to succumb to serious injuries at Ruaridh Knott, who had to bear off the pitch, and after that Ayr still rose to his lead with a touchdown goal from Stafford McDowall, after Climo turned the baton on.
Blair Macpherson, Ayr's manager, was then given the yellow card and Melrose used again to be a man with a touch mark from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a difficult search.
However, the locals came back strong and when Struan Hutchinson got the yellow card for catching the Climo without the ball, MacPherson scored a touchdown goal behind the Ayr suit, after a side quiz.
Climo reversed the bid, as he did again shortly after the restart, after Kyle Rowe caught kicking David Amrstrong off the pitch and sent it to Gregor Henry who scored the team's fifth touchdown goal.

According to official records, he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor didn't want to say anything about the news, but Scottish Sun quoted Kiernan as saying he wanted to take part in Glasgow's "live restaurant business".
“The Sea is Ours”: Bolivia’s beachless country hopes court will reopen path to the Pacific Ocean
Marines stand guard at the naval headquarters in La Paz.
General buildings flag the blue flag.
Fleet stations from the Titicaca River to the Amazon River are marked with the slogan: “We are entitled to the sea.
It’s our job to get it back.”
Across the rest of Bolivia, however, the reminder of the coastline lost to Chile in bloody conflicts in the 19th century, still in fresh memory - along with the desire to sail across the Pacific again.
These hopes are perhaps the strongest in decades, now that Bolivia is awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice in The Hague on October 1 after five years of lengthy litigation.
“Bolivia lives on the power, the spirit of unity and the supreme indifference, and of course awaits the verdict with a positive mind,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivarian diplomat.
Many residents of Bolivia will be watching the ruling of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country, in the hope that the Hague Court will rule on Bolivia in favor of their demand that Chile be obliged to grant Bolivia access to the sea, after many decades of decades.
The ruling on Monday is also extremely important for Evo Morales, the country’s president of Indian descent, who will be in a contentious fight for re-election next year.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised in late August.
But some analysts consider it unlikely that the court ruled in Bolivia’s favor, and that it would change little if he did.
The Court, which is headquartered in the Netherlands, has no power to give land from Chile and has provided that the ruling will not affect the outcome of the possible talks.
The fact that the court’s ruling comes just six months after the hearing of the final hearings suggests that the case “would not have been complicated,” said Paz S<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
It is also possible that the last four years have not been a matter for Bolivia to move forward, but that they have caused the country to turn back.
"The current government of Bolivia has stolen the issue of access to the sea," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Hersk<0xC3><0xA1>’s speeches Morales has detracted from all goodwill from Sile, she believed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks sometime, but it will be extremely difficult after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, former president of Bolivia and representative of the country in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision had taken an unusually short time.
On Monday, Bolivia will be given “a unique opportunity to open up a new relationship with Chile” and an opportunity to “end an argument that reaches 139 years back, for the benefit of both countries,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Roman America, would use this issue as a political promotion.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“The decision is an opportunity to see that we need to make up for the past.”
North Korea says there will be no price for nuclear disarmament unless it can be trusted by the United States
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says the country will never take down its nuclear weapons first if it can’t trust Washington.
Ri delivered his speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to abide by the promises it made at a meeting in Singapore between the leaders of the nations.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be resuming talks on nuclear weapons, more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's "dreams" to maintain that continued trade bans and U.S. protests against the declaration of an end to the Korean War will someday engulf North Korea.
Washington does not want to accept the declaration unless Pyongyang first takes clearer action to bring down its nuclear weapons.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, the president of the United States, want to meet again at another meeting.
There are serious doubts, however, that Pyongyang is serious about taking down weapons that the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the next meeting between Kim and Trump.
Exhibitions in Paris present the latest line of large headwear that will come to fashion stores near you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or be completely hidden from the sun, you don’t need to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed off a variety of quirky hats in oversize for their SS19 line at the fashion show that captivated the buzz of Paris Fashion Week.
A number of images of extremely inconvenient ways have been posted on Instagram this summer and these designers have had their innovative creations showcased at fashion shows.
The main work of Valentino was a large light-brown hat with wide ridges that resembled feathers and covered the heads of the models.
Of other oversized accessories, watermelons could see placed gemstones, peanut butter and even pineapple, but these things are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a variety of strange masks, just at the right time for a snorkeling session.
Many of the colourful masks had assembled lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter rather than hathizian.
One mask resembled a diving device with a breathing tube and glasses, while the other looked like melting ice in bread form.
If you want to make money in fashion, luck is with you.
Experts predict that the big hats could soon go on sale in fashion stores near you.
Big hats bring a dose to the heel of "La Bomba", a hat with over 60cm large ridges that has graced the head from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The fashion label behind the extremely inconvenient hat, which was seen on all social media, was inspired by another large accessory that appeared on the fashion scene – a beach bag made of hay that was almost the same size as the swimsuit model that wore it.
The orange-coloured cap, with a leather strap and white handle, was the main feature of the La Riviera SS10 Jacquemus at Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, the stylist of the famous people, said in an interview with FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags appear in the fashion stores for next summer - where the designer has caused such a huge impact should be difficult to ignore the demand for accessories."
John Edward: Language Skills are Necessary for Global Citizens
The private schools in Scotland are known for their outstanding student performances and it has continued in 2018 with new, stunning test results, which are further enhanced by individual and group performances in sports, arts, music and other communities.
These schools have up to 30,000 students across Scotland, with The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) advocating for them, and they strive to provide their students and their parents with the best possible service.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further studies, the career path they have chosen and their status as citizens of the world.
As a teaching speaker who can put together and teach according to customized curriculums, we see that newcomers continue to be a popular subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it touches his mind.
If you speak to him in his native language, it touches his heart.”
This is an important reminder that we can’t just rely on English to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
This year’s test results show us that languages are at the top of the lists with the highest proportions of students who pass tests in private schools.
Sixty-eight percent of students who studied a foreign language received the grade A.
The data, collected from 74 schools within SCIS, showed that 72 percent of students received the grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those learning German, 69 percent of those learning French and 63 percent of those learning Spanish also received the grade A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support a foreign language as a necessary skill that children and young people will surely need to maintain in the future.
At the moment, languages, as electives, are placed in the same place as science-related subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of private schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted in 2014 by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that for reasons that employers indicated were difficult to recruit, 17 percent were due to a lack of people with language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future work.
Now that more and more jobs require language proficiency, this skill is essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career people choose, it will have a real advantage in the future if it learns another language, but it is a skill that lasts a lifetime.
The ability to have direct communication with people from other countries will automatically give a multi-talented person a head start on the competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent of them could not speak a second language well enough to hold conversations, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, or 15 percent.
Therefore, it is important for children of today to invest immediately in language teaching.
Multilingualism, especially in emerging markets, will provide children with a better opportunity to find meaningful work.
In Scotland, it is different between schools what language they teach.
A certain number of schools will focus on classic novelties, while others will teach languages that are considered to be most important for the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter where your child’s interest lies, they will always be able to choose from languages in private schools with specialised teachers.
Scottish private schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
It cannot be denied that at this time, in the global business environment, language continues to be necessary for the future of the country, and it must be reflected in education.
In fact, one should really look at modern languages as “international communication skills.”
Private schools will continue to offer choice, diversity and superiority to Scotland’s youth.
You have to do it right.
John Edwards is the President of the Scottish Private School Council.
LeBron will play his first game for the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait is soon over for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers team.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Sunday in the opening game of the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It has not yet been determined how many minutes he will play.
“It will be longer than a minute and shorter than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Mike Trudell, a reporter for the Lakers, said on Twitter that James would likely play for a limited time.
After training earlier this week, James was asked out in his plans for the Lakers' six-game schedule for the start of the season.
“At this stage in my career, I don’t have to play games before the season to prepare me,” he said.
Schedules for Trump’s election meeting in West Virginia and YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will hold a number of election meetings and the first is tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
He is one of five scheduled meetings next week, where he will also stop at friendly venues, including in Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote to confirm his election to the new Supreme Court has been put on hold, Trump’s goal is to build support for the next midterm elections, because Republicans are in danger of losing control of parliament when votes are paid in November.
What time is the Trump election in West Virginia, and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is set to begin at 7:00 p.m. on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the meeting with Trump in West Virginia online below through a live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss the trial of Brett Kavanaugh, a nominee of the Supreme Court, in which tension reigned over the allegations of sexual assault. The elderhood's ballot to confirm him as a judge was put on hold for up to a week while the FBI raided
But Trump’s main goal is to help the Republicans achieve a better path, but they are awaiting difficult elections in November.
Therefore, the message from Trump’s election campaign was that these five meetings, which will be held next week, were aimed at “filling volunteers and supporters with fervour that Republicans are trying to protect and increase with the majority they have in the Reuters academy and at the congress.”
“Control of the House of Representatives is so necessary to the president’s plan that he will travel to as many counties as possible and a second campaign period is already beginning,” an unnamed spokesman for Trump’s campaign told Reuters.
The meeting tonight will be held at the Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling and supporters are expected to come from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and the Pittsburgh media are telling of him,” according to the West Virginia Metro News Agency.
The meeting on Saturday will be Trump’s second visit to West Virginia this month, but he won by over 40 percent in that county in 2016.
Trump wants to try to help Patrick Morrissey, the proponent of the West Virginia Republicans for the Elderly Division, but he’s down in the polls.
"It is not a good knowledge for Morrissey that the president needs to come and try to increase his popularity," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows willingness to fight to keep hope alive for the individual race on Sunday
After three one-sided rounds, the fourth game, which was Saturday afternoon, could be exactly what was needed in this competition for the Ryder Cup.
Swings in success is a sporting concept that has been invented and that players truly believe in, and never more than in competitions like this one.
Where would they say their success is now?
“They were six points ahead and now it’s four points, so the success is rather on our side now, I expect,” Spieth said as he started the race.
Europe, of course, is ahead, four steps ahead with an additional twelve in the hood.
The Americans, as Spieth said, consider themselves to have some wind in the sails and they can be hopeful of many, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each received three points out of four.
Spieth has played hugely everything apart to flat and leads by his example.
The cheers rose along the way and he put down an important squat to keep all four levels in the game after he and Thomas had been two levels down after two games.
His coach, who assured them victory in the 15th hole game, received a similar cheer, a shout of the kind that tells one that he believes the American team still does not win.
“You just have to dig deep and think about your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all these players can do right now.
18 holes to earn points.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinaro and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
This strange but captivating European couple has won four games out of four and can’t do anything wrong.
“Moliwood” were the only pair to have a schooling on Saturday afternoon, but they also managed to avoid schooling on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and on the nine-hole pitch on Friday morning.
The game and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the loud audience clearly shows that they are a pair that need to win on Sunday, and there would be no popular player to seal the possible victory of the European team but Fleetwood or Molinari, the sun is set over Le Golf.
The best option would be for both to do it at the same time on different holes.
It’s still too early to talk about the victory of the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson went lightly with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the game in the morning, where he played with Alex Noren.
A schoolboy and two doubles in the first nine holes dug the Spaniard and the Pig into a hole they never managed to crawl out of.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The quads and quads are so exciting to watch closely because of the interactions between the pairs, their advice, the advice they don’t give and how the game plan can change in one go.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a significant lead before the final day but these four-games also showed that the U.S. team has the will to fight that some had doubts about, especially other Americans.
Europe with 10-6 lead for the final day of the competition for the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good lead for the final day of the Ryder Cup after the quarter-finals and the quarter-finals on Saturday, with a lead of 10-6 against the United States.
Starfighters Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over the struggling Tiger Woods, and have scored four points on the Le Golf National course.
European team Thomas Bjorns, who would like to regain the award cup, which it lost on the Hazeltine field two years ago, showed great superiority over the US team in the morning quarter-final and won 3-1.
The United States showed more resistance in the quarterfinals and won two games, but failed to win the standings.
Team Jim Furyks needed eight points from 12 individual games on Sunday to keep the cup going.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row and he and Molinari, part of the nickname "Molliwood" after a spectacular weekend, are just the second pair to win four points from their first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball game, they showed great teamwork and beat the downtrodden Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau 5-4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, showed his cleverness once, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in quarterbacks and four-games and seven games in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning four-ball game, returned to his team-mate, Henriks Stenson in the quarter-finals and they won 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are in first and third place on the list of the best golfers in the world.
Europe, however, did not take advantage of this mild and gustasama day southwest of Paris.
The three-time winner of the majors in golf, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the goal for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won 2-1 against Jon Rahm of Spain and Ian Poulter in the quarter-finals and later came back and defeated Poulter and Rory Mcllroy 4-3 in the quarter-finals after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in the history of the Ryder Cup that the team has won four points will at the beginning of an individual race, although the team of Furyk needed only equals to keep the cup going.
After being the second best for two days, however, the attack on Sunday seems to be a victim of them.
North Korea Says Unilateral Disarmament ‘Impossible’ Without Confidence
The U.N. Secretary of State said on Saturday that the continuing trade bans jibe only at their distrust of the United States and it would be impossible for the country to dismantle its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual U.N. General Assembly that North Korea had taken “substantial actions to show goodwill” in the past year, for example by halting nuclear and missile tests, taking down the nuclear test site and the nuclear test site.
"However, we have not seen any corresponding reaction from the United States," he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there is no certainty about the security of our country, and under such circumstances, it is impossible for us to unilaterally take down our nuclear weapons first.”
While Ri had repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s opposition to the “step-by-step” approach to nuclear disarmament where North Korea would be compensated for every step it takes, his statement seemed special to the extent that he did not deny a unilateral denial.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between the acting US president and the North Korean leader, in Singapore on June 12, where Kim said he was working to "secure the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula" and Trump issued a statement on the issue.
North Korea has sought solutions to formally end the Korean War in 1950-53, but the United States has said Pyongyang must leave its nuclear weapons behind first.
Washington has also resisted calls to relax a stringent trade ban against North Korea.
“The U.S. demands that nuclear disarmament take place first,” Ri said, “and increases the pressure by using trade bans to achieve its goal, and even oppose the declaration to end the war.
“There are only dreamers of people who don’t know anything about us who think that business bans can bring us to our knees.
But the problem is that continuing trade bans increase our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for another meeting between Kim and Trump that the US leader spoke about at the UN earlier this week.
The prime minister spoke instead of three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-in, the leader of South Korea for the past five months, adding: "If the party to this nuclear disarmament issue were South Korea instead of the United States, the United States would not be in this position."
Despite this, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from his speech last year when he told the U.N. General Assembly that it would be inevitable to target missiles from North Korea to the U.S. mainland after "the devilish president" Trump called Kim a "flag."
Last year, Trump threatened to “destroy” North Korea, but this year he praised Kim at the United Nations for his courage in taking a step towards disarmament, but said there would still be much work to do and that trade bans would continue to apply until the end of the year.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame in this regard, saying: “If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia say the U.N. Security Council should compensate Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, Mike Pompeo, the U.S. Secretary of State, told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The Security Council’s trade bans must continue to apply until complete nuclear disarmament has taken place and it has been confirmed.”
The Security Council agreed to increase trade bans with North Korea from 2006 in an attempt to close funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said success had been achieved, but only hours later, North Korea condemned him for making “criminal demands.”
North Korea has vowed at a meeting with Moon this month to take down a rocket site and a nuclear power plant if the United States intervenes in “corresponding action.”
He said Kim had told himself that the “corresponding actions” he was looking for were assurances of the security Trump promised in Singapore and actions toward normal relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard take classes at a good rest.
A new course at Harvard University has given all students more sleep in an attempt to counter the growing tendency of students to wake up and learn all night long with the help of caffeine tablets.
Research has shown that students at the best universities in the world often know little or nothing when it comes to the basics of thinking about themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, designed the course and believes it is the first of its kind in the United States.
He got the idea of doing the course after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning ability.
“At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why is this first told to me now, in my final year?’
She said no one had told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told the Telegraph.
The curriculum, which is held for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits contribute to learning ability and performance in sports and contribute even to general well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the head of the school’s health care department, said the university had decided to introduce the course after finding out that students were extremely sleepy during the week.
The course is an hour-long course and involves a variety of interactive projects.
In one part, there is a picture of a room at home, where students click on coffee balls, window sills, sports shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how performance in sports can worsen with a lack of sleep, as well as the importance of a good sleep routine.
In the second part, participants are told how lack of sleep over the long term can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the school area with interactive symbols then encourages participants to think about their daily habits.
“We know that this will not change the behavior of the students.
But we feel that they have a right to know this, just as one has a right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture that pays homage to those who wake up and learn all night is still present, he said, adding that modern technology and the filtering pressure on students meant that lack of sleep was a growing problem.
Ensuring sufficient sleep of good quality should be the “secret weapon” of students to defend stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said – even to avoid being obese, because sleep deprivation increases the brain’s call for food so that the body is starving.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student in chemistry and physics from California, helped Professor Czeisler put the course together, but he sat one of the professor’s courses last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and encouraged him to call for a course for all students in the school.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all master students to complete a similar course before they start their studies at the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm clock, which reminds them to go to bed, and to wake them, and keep in mind the harmful effects of blue light that electronic screens and LED lights give off, but it can confuse the internal clock of the body as well as the
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mark from Menga shoots down men Gerrards
The Rangers still have trouble on the outside as Stevens Gerrards' split team had to settle for a 1-0 loss to Livingston, after a goal from Dolly Menga.
Team Ibrox wanted to achieve their first win on the field after their victory at St Johnstone in February, but team Gary Holt gave Gerrards team only their second loss in his 18 games as manager. The team is now eight points behind Hearts, who is in the top spot in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers team seemed to lack all inspiration and was never likely to equalize.
The Rangers now fall to sixth place, but Livingston goes up to third and are only following the Hibernian in goalkeeping.
Rangers could end up in further trouble after liner Calum Spence needed to get a glimpse of a head injury after some item was thrown at him from the midfielder's guests.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that swept Ayr away and made it to the finals in the Betfred Cups.
Holt, on the other hand, kept up with the same Livi 11 setup that reached a level of Hearts last week and he would have been pleased with how well-trained his teammates overcame the challenge.
The Rangers may have had more with the ball, but Livingston created more opportunities with the balls it reached.
They should have scored just two minutes after the start of the game when the first transmission from Menga came Scott Pitman ahead of Allan McGregor's goal, but he missed.
Keaghan Jacobs' long run ended with Craig Halkett, but Alan Lithgow, his defender, shot past the pole.
The Rangers regained control of the game but seemed to live rather in hope than belief in their game in the final trimester of the game.
Alfredo Morales certainly felt that he should have been convicted when the fourth was out of the game, when he and Steven Lawless were due to meet, but Judge Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian appeal.
The Rangers only managed to score two shots in the first half, but Liam Kelly, a former Ibrox goaltender, didn't need to have much to defend the skulls from Lassana Coulibaly and easy shots from Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livi’s 34th minute opportunity had come despite the fact that the team had overtaken the hand, no one can deny that they deserved it, albeit only because of their tenacity.
The Rangers again failed to do anything from Jacobs' long side.
Scott Arfield did not fail when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose to send on Menga who then scored easily.
Gerrard took his advice in half and sent Ryan Kent in to replace Coulibaly and the exchange had an impact almost immediately when Morelos came in, but Kelly quickly collapsed and ran up to close the shot.
Livingston, however, continued to trick guests into playing exactly the kind of game they enjoyed playing, and Lithgow and Halkett achieved each long mission on the feet of another.
Holt's team could have increased their lead in the closing minutes, but McGregor did well in denying Jacobs a chance before Lithgow ran to the finish from the corner.
Glenn Middleton, the Rangers' second-in-command, wanted a second shot when he and Jacobs fell down, but Thomson pointed it out again.
Almanak: The Man Who Invented the Geiger Counter
Here is a page from our almanac "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today and AFRAM... this is the day that the futurist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, and the invention eventually led to a device called a Geiger meter.
The Geiger meter has gained a permanent position in the scientific world since it was also popular in the pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in unlikely roles as scientists:
He said, “What the hell is this?”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger meter, used to find radioactive materials like uranium.
When you put this hearing aid on you, you can hear the effects of the atoms because of the radioactivity in the rocks."
Evans: “It really sucks now!”
Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to ‘see’ dangerous cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” dangerous cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize dangerous cells as part of the treatment
The treatment involves taking immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory.
They can then “see” proteins, which are common in many cancer cells, and are then injected back into the patient.
Vaccines at the experimental stage have shown positive results in patients suffering from different types of cancer.
In one woman who received the vaccine, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months. The vaccine teaches immune cells to recognize dangerous cancer cells.
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein called HER2 that is found in many types of cancer. Then the cells are injected back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. Cancer Institute in Bethesday, Maryland, said: “Our findings suggest that the vaccine is highly effective.”
HER2 "stops various types of cancer from growing," including breast, ovarian, lung, and colon and rectum cancers, said Berzofsky, a professor.
A similar method in which immune cells are taken from patients and they are “trained” to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a single type of leukaemia.
Kanye West held a long debate in support of Trump and wore a Maga suit after appearing in the television series SNL.
It didn't end well
Kanye West was greeted at the studio in the Saturday Night Live episode after a lengthy speech in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would be running for president in 2020.
After airing the third song of the evening, Ghost Town, where he wore the Make America Great cover, he spoke out against the Democrats for a long time and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I’ve talked so often to white people who say, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a race hater?’
“If I were worried about racial hatred, I would have long since moved out of the United States,” he said.
SNL kicked off the show with a glass in which Hollywood star Matt Damon mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee over Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual assault.
Although the long-lost West was not broadcast, the recording of it was put on social media by the joker Chris Rock.
It’s not clear if Rock wanted to make fun of West by releasing the recording.
West had also complained to the audience that he had received bad receptions from the back of the field because of his hoodie.
“I was put in the back seat.
They said to me, “Don’t go up to the stage with this hood.”
They put me in jail!
Then they say I'm in a deep hole," he said, according to news from the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want to see the deep hole?” and said that he would put on his superhero costume “because that means you can’t order me to work. Do you want the world to make progress?
“Try the love.”
His comments were met with a booby-trap from the audience at least twice, and SNL's actors seemed embarrassed, according to Variety, and one attendee told the paper: "There was a stone silence in the studio."
West had been invited to the show to replace the singer Ariona Grande, but her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with his stage performance when he sang the song I Love It, dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from Candace Turner, the chairman of the TPUSA group, but she said on Twitter: “To one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR SEEING MUCH AWAY.”
But chat manager Karen Hunter said on Twitter that West was simply being “himself and that’s quite wonderful.”
“But I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his ‘list’) who I feel supports and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
“We are too,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he was now "the creature that was previously known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change the name and footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, has also called himself Snoop Lion and can not forget the musical legend Prince the Hedgehog, who changed his name to a symbol and later called himself the artist who was previously known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder after a knife attack on a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after being stabbed at a restaurant in Belfast on Tuesday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendant is expected to appear in court in Belfast on Monday.
The prosecutor will go over the charges.
Kit Harington, star of the Crown Games, criticizes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent HBO adventure series The Crown Games.
The 31-year-old, however, has criticized the standard male hero film and says that such a role on the screen means that young boys often feel that they need to be hard on themselves to gain respect.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of male poisoning in the #MeToo period.
Kit, who recently married his Crown Games partner, the 31-year-old Rose Leslie, admitted that he had "strong views" on how to deal with the matter.
“Personally, I feel at the moment – what’s wrong with the masculine culture?”
“What have we taught men in their upbringing about the problems we see now?”
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for an increase in toxic masculinity, due to the extreme masculinity of television.
He continued: “What is born and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets that makes young boys feel like they have to be a certain type of man?
I think that’s one of the most important questions of our time – how do we change this?
“It’s clear that something has gone wrong with young men.”
He also admitted in the interview that he would not play in any other Crown Drama after the series is likely next summer and said that he had had "enough battlefields and horses."
Starting in November, Kit will play in a remake of True West, a film by Sam Shepard, which tells the story of the film producer and his brother who is a robber.
The actor recently said that the best thing to have played in the Crown Games would be to have met his wife, Rose.
“I met my wife in these episodes, so they somehow gave me my future family and my life after that,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the lover of Jon Snow as Kit played in these Emmy-winning roles.
The couple married in June 2018, in the country of the Lesliar family in Scotland.
HIV/Devastation: China announces 14% increase in new infections
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of nationals infected with the HIV virus or with devastation.
Health authorities say more than 820,000 people have been infected in the country.
About 40,000 new infections were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new infections occurred with sex, which is a change from what was before.
Previously, the HIV virus spread rapidly in some parts of China due to the donation of infected blood.
On the other hand, the number of people infected by the HIV virus in this way has fallen again to almost zero, according to Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people infected with HIV or the virus has increased by 100,000 from year to year.
HIV infection caused by sex is a serious problem within the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been illegal in China since 1997, but there is still a lot of discrimination against LGBT people.
According to a recent study, 70-90% of men who have sex with other men eventually get married to a woman.
Many infections will occur due to inadequate contraception in these marriages.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged access for all to HIV drugs as part of a plan to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaking data from Republican lawmakers, criticizes 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy allegations'
Maxine Waters, a member of the House of Representatives, on Saturday denied allegations that one of her employees had disclosed personal information of three senior Republican lawmakers on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said these claims came from “over-recognizable” extremists and websites.
“Lies, lies and more horrible lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information published included the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of whom are from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday from unknown parties on Capitol Hill while interrogations were being conducted at the aging ward of Brett Kavanaugh, the nominee of the Supreme Court, over allegations of sexual misconduct.
The leak came sometime after the three senior congressmen had interrogated Kavanaugh.
Containing pages such as Gateway Pundit and RedState said the IP numbers identifying the author of the information were linked to Waters’ office and published information about one of its employees, according to information from Capitol Hill.
“This unwarranted accusation is absolutely wrong and a pure lie,” Waters continued.
"My employee - whose personal information and security are now at risk due to these false accusations - was in no way responsible for this information breach.
This unwarranted accusation is an absolute falsehood.”
Waters' statement was quickly criticized online, including by Ara Fleischer, former White House press secretary.
“This denial is full of anger,” Fleischer wrote.
“It’s a sign that she doesn’t have the capacity to sit in Congress.
When someone is accused of being unreasonable, they should not react with anger.
There can be no opposition.
You can’t ask for the reasons of the person who is responsible.
We need to show calmness and calmness.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters’s reaction to criticism from Democrats of Kavanaugh judges, who critics said seemed too angry at Thursday’s trial.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate against Waters in the midterm elections, also said his opinion on Twitter.
"It's great if it's true," he said.
In a statement, Waters said her office had made “the appropriate authorities and law enforcement officials aware of these false claims.
“We will ensure that the other culprits are found,” she continued, “and that they are held accountable for all those acts that are harmful and dangerous to all my employees.”
Film review for Johnny English Strikes again - spy film with Rowan Atkinson turns out to be a small force
It has become a habit now to look for Brexit references in all the new pictures where Britain comes to history, and that seems to apply in this revival of the Johnny English comic series - which began in 2003 with the film Johnny English and rightly resurrected in 2011 with the film Johnny English.
Will this candid satire about how obviously disgusting we are being a new export opportunity for the country?
Whether or not the outcast, grumpy and clumsy Johnny English has been renewed for a second time to spoil everything - his name shows above and beyond that he is a creative work designed for exhibitions in non-English-speaking countries.
He is, of course, the witty secret serviceman who presumably resides over captivating characters but is a bit of a mix of Clouseau, that of Mr. Bean and a bit of a slap in the face of the man who played one night for the song Chariots of Fire at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
It is also originally based on the tourist and mysterious citizen of the world whom the Atkinsons once played in the forgotten Barclaycard television commercials, where he left everything to himself in turmoil.
There are one or two good things in this latest Johnny English movie.
I enjoyed watching Johnny English walk on a helicopter dressed in a medium-sized armor and the helicopter blades would fall into his helmet.
Atkinson clearly shows his wits, but the humor seems rather powerless and strangely superficial, especially already "serious" films such as James Bond and the Mission Impossible films also offer unhesitating jokes.
The grin seems to be intended for children rather than adults, and I found the adventures that Johnny English landed in not as imaginative and focused as the silent jokes of Atkinson in Mr. Beans’ art.
The biggest problem with the film is that the UK is in big trouble.
A computer hacker has managed to break into Britain’s secret intelligence network and come up with the identity of all British intelligence, to a great extent for the intelligence officer who is on guard – but there, unfortunately, Kevin Eldon finds himself in too small a role.
This is the finale for the Prime Minister who is a proud and contentious figure and already in great danger due to immense political infatuation: Emma Thompson is doing her best with her role as a character to remind Theresa May, but the script is not up to him on many fish.
Her advisers tell her that all active scouts are in danger and that she must find someone who had already settled in the weekend rock.
And there Johnny English himself comes to the story, now a school principal in some nice school, but also provides covert instruction on how to be a spy: here are a few funny jokes English offers at a spy school reminiscent of the film School of Rock.
English is called back to Whitehall at an emergency meeting and meets there Bough, his former long-suffering companion, whom Ben Miller plays again.
Bough is now a married man, his wife is a submarine manager, but in this energetic role Vicki Pepperdine does not quite manage to let his light shine.
Now, the Nj<0xC3><0xB3>snatv<0xC3><0xAD>eyku, who is at the service of her majesty, is back in gear and meets the high-profile Ophelia Bulletova, who is played by Olga Kurylenko.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is fond of the magic of the fascinating billionaire inside a tech giant, which is said to be able to solve the problem of the British computer scientist: it is the evil Jason Volta, the game of Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their downtrodden journey: they light up the fine French restaurant duffels as servants, they cause trouble as they sneak into Volta's luxury chat, and English turns everything upside down when he tries to use virtual reality glasses to introduce himself.
There’s nothing to be spared in that final detail, but although the film is fiery and energetic, it still has some of the baby material in it as a whole.
Medium-sized material.
And just like with the other Johnny English pictures, I couldn’t help but think: can the British film industry let Rowan Atkinson get a role that really fits his skills?
The Labour Party denies that he is creating a four-day workweek plan for Britain, with the same wages as for five days a week.
The Labour Party, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is now considering a radical plan that would allow Britain to work for four days a week, but get paid for five.
According to the group, the company wants to let the executives of companies take advantage of the savings generated from the revolution in artificial intelligence, and let employees benefit by getting one extra day off.
Employees could then enjoy three days of long weekends, without lowering their wages.
Sources say the idea would "fit" the party's economic plan and its policy of improving the welfare of the working people.
Trades Union Congress has supported the four-day shortening of the working week as a way for workers to take advantage of changes in the economy.
A senior Labour official told the Sunday Times: “It is planned that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
“The change will not take place overnight, but a four-day working week is a goal that is consistent with the group’s approach to changing the economy for the benefit of the working people and with the group’s overall industrial policy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support this idea, but the Green Party promised a four-day working week in its 2017 election campaign.
The goal, however, is not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “Four days of work week is not on the party’s policy sheet and the party is not considering implementing it.”
John McDonnell, the shadow ministry’s trade minister, used the Labour Party’s conference last week to outline his ideas about social revolution within the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to reclaim power from “unknown CEOs” and “collectors” of utilities.
The shadow minister’s plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not get their full share back, as the Labour government could impose a “deduction” for alleged misconduct.
He has also confirmed plans to put employees on corporate boards and create a joint equity fund to leave 10 percent of the assets of private companies to their employees, who could get <0xC2><0xA3>500 in profits from them annually.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 minutes" if FBI investigation on Kavanaugh could get them to change their mind
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has caused at least a week's delay in a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court, raising the question of whether her findings could lead to a return to the Senate.
In an interview that will be shown on Sunday, Scott Pelley, a reporter on the "60 Minutes" episode of Republicans and senior lawmakers John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, asked if the FBI could bring something to light that would get them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said when the trial began, I said I was talking to a Kavanaugh judge.
I called him after the accusations were made and asked, “Did you do this?”
He was determined, firm, undeniable.”
Graham's vote, however, seems to be unchanging.
“I’ve made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and it would need an incredible excuse to change that,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett firmly denied it,” Graham added, quoting Christine Blasey Ford.
“And everyone she mentions by name couldn’t confirm it.
This case is 36 years old.
I don’t think anything new will change.”
What is the international city festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival will be held on Saturday in New York. It is an annual music event where a series of big stars will perform and with a similarly influential direction; to end poverty around the world.
This is the seventh year that the International City Festival has been held and tens of thousands of people will be fleeing to Central Park, not only to listen to music from Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to draw attention to the actual goals of the 20th anniversary of the festival.
The International Urban Festival, first held in 2012, is part of the Global Poverty Project, but there are international organizations that want to end poverty by increasing the number of people fighting against it.
To get free tickets to the event (except for those who want to pay for VIP tickets), concertgoers needed to complete various tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, sending emails to one of the world's leaders, calling a call, or using other available means.
But how much success has the festival achieved, already 12 years in the direction of achieving the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free music a real way to convince people to call for action, or is this just one so-called “click action” – where people feel it does something that matters by signing petitioners online or sending a message on Twitter?
Global Citizen says that as of 2011, it has recorded over 19 million “actions” from its supporters, calling for a variety of different goals.
It says these actions have helped to get the world’s leaders to outline commitments and policies equivalent to over $35 billion that will impact the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group counted 390 commitments and notifications due to his actions, of which at least $10 billion has been invested or raised.
The group estimates that the fundraising so far has had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main commitments comes from The Power of Nutrition, a company of investors and executives in the UK that works to "help children enjoy their fullest," and pledged to provide 35 million dollars to Rwanda to help end the global malnutrition crisis in the country, according to the report.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, governments around the world and international citizens like you, we can leave the social injustice that malnutrition is a thing of the past,” said Tracey Ullmann, representative of The Power of Nutrition 2018 at The Power of Nutrition.
The group also said that after 5,000 calls were sent that Britain should improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the funding of the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children and provide them with better nutrition.
On the list of common questions on the group’s website, one question is as follows: “Why do you think you can end wound poverty?”
Global Citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult task – sometimes we will fail constantly.
But, we will reach our limits, just like movements that fought for citizens’ rights and the abolition of racial segregation ahead of us, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among those featured at the event this year. The event will be held in New York City and features Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the navy as a "barrier" to prevent Russia's energy exports, says interior minister
“If necessary,” Washington could use the navy to prevent energy from reaching the market in Russia, including in the Middle East, says Ryan Zinke, U.S. Home Secretary, according to a report from the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s assistance to Syria, especially since the country works in the legitimate government there, would be a model for exploring new markets.
“I think the reason for their existence in the Middle East is that they want to do business with energy like in Eastern Europe and its southern part,” he said.
And, according to the official announcement, there are ways and methods to track it.
“The U.S. can use the naval force to ensure that sea lanes are open and to form barriers, if necessary, to ensure that energy from them does not enter the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed guests at a gathering hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a charity that calls itself the “voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington’s approach to dealing with Russia and Iran and said it was more or less the same.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is to make more and less use of energy supplies and replace them with others,” he said, saying Russia has only one card in hand with an economy that is dependent on fossil fuels.
The announcement comes as the Trump administration wants to increase its natural gas exports to Europe and replace Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, officials in the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump himself, have tried to get Germany to stop participating in the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 project of laying a new power line, which Trump says would make Berlin “capture” Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly argued that the 11 billion dollar Nord Stream 2 power line, which will double the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is only an economic project.
The Russians say that Washington’s strong opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for applying pressure and that consumers should be able to choose between suppliers," Alexander Novak, Russia's energy minister, said after a meeting with Rick Perry, the U.S. energy minister, in Moscow in September.
The position of the United States has been criticized by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial association, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US not to switch from the EU’s energy policy and a bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
“I am very dissatisfied that foreign countries are changing our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, chairman of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a meeting recently with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “seriously consider” bidding for the presidency in 2020, she says
Elizabeth Warren, a senior Massachusetts lawmaker, said on Saturday she would "seriously consider" bidding for president after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed that she would consider attending a town meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and shape our government, and then we need a woman as leader,” she said in a statement.
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president.”
Warren spoke about President Donald Trump at the meeting, saying he was “taking the country in the wrong direction.
“I’m very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been disgusted by his criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his nominee Supreme Court Justice.
On Friday, Warren said on Twitter that “of course we have to have the FBI investigate the matter before the vote proceeds.”
A poll published on Thursday, however, shows that the majority of voters in Warrens County do not feel that it should be bidding by 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senior congressman should not run, according to a poll published by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent said they supported her supply.
The poll showed more support for the supply of Deval Patrick, former governor, with 38 percent saying they support his possible supply and 48 percent saying they are against it.
Among other popular Democrats who were discussed for a possible presidential bid in 2020 were Joe Biden, former vice president, and Bernie Sanders, a senior congressman from Vermont.
Biden said he would make a public decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin Talks About Donald Trump's Track Palin Collision
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year after joining the military in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“My son is going through a lot of difficulties after coming back, I find with other families who feel the impact of the collision disruption and the mental wounds that our soldiers are returning home with,” she told audiences at an election rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said her son and other soldiers "come back just a little differently, they are hardened and wonder if there is any respect for what their comrades in the army and air force and other departments of the country have done."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, trying to prevent a domestic violence report, and for gun violence under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 counties and Washington D.C. support a challenge against a new shelter leadership policy
Eighteen counties and Washington, D.C. support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies victims fleeing domestic or pedestrian violence.
Representatives from 18 counties and the city submitted a court report on Friday in Washington to support a asylum seeker who opposes the policy, according to a report from NBC News.
The full name of the defendant in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against the U.S. policy has not been disclosed.
She said her husband "and his violent sons who were members of the gang," had used her violence, but U.S. officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20.
She was taken into custody in Texas.
The prosecutors, who support Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries where problems related to walking and domestic violence are increasing. The number of asylum seekers to the United States comes from these countries.
The new asylum-seeker policy revokes a decision that the Immigrant Appeals Board had made in 2014 to allow unregistered immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, a Washington prosecutor, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "defeated decades of state-of-the-art and international law."
“State law requires a decision to be made on all asylum applications based on the facts and circumstances of the application, and this policy violates this rule,” the court said in a statement.
Lawyers further stated in the report that the policy that denied immigrants entry would be harmful to the U.S. economy, and argued that immigrants were more likely to start a business and “provide a significant workforce.”
Jeff Sessions, a prosecutor, ordered immigration judges to stop providing shelter to victims of domestic violence and gang-rape who fled in June.
“Those who leave their homeland because of persecution based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion can apply for asylum,” Sessions said in a statement on June 11.
It was never intended to solve all the problems, not even all the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue operations in a race to find survivors in Palu, who are believed to be doubling the number of dead
The situation becomes more difficult for those who have survived.
“There’s a lot of tension in the air,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she comforted her sick son at the Palu City Relief Center.
“Cars are coming in with bodies all the time.
There’s not much clean water.”
Residents were seen returning to their devastated homes and searching in the suction cups of their possessions to try to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were overcrowded and damaged after the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had a back and shoulder fracture, were lying outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were being treated outdoors due to continued violent aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he told how he found the earthquake shaking his hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I'm pushing up to the wall ruins, I think," Harris told the Associated Press, saying his family had been in town to go to a wedding.
“I heard my wife call for help, but then she was silent.
I don’t know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they’re safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Violence’ with ‘Proclamation of Parents’
A week after an official newspaper in China published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper to discuss mutual benefits in trade between the two countries, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using U.S. media to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump spoke last Wednesday about the announcement of the Chinese newspaper in the Des Moines Register newspaper - which is Iowa's best-selling newspaper - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. presidential election that will be held on November 6.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing wanted to interfere in U.S. elections marketed what U.S. officials told Reuters that would be a new stage in Washington’s escalating campaign to apply Chinese pressure.
While it is normal for foreign governments to publish ads to push trade, Beijing and Washington have a staggering trade war, with new tariffs on import goods from both countries.
Chinese and U.S. experts say China’s retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were designed to hurt exporters in counties such as Iowa, which backed Trump’s Republican party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former Iowa governor for the long term, but that county is exporting a lot of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad told the Des Moines Register on Sunday that “China is now increasing its persecutions by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free media.”
“By spreading its reputation, the Chinese government is using the beloved free speech heritage of the United States and our free media by publishing a costly advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad said in a statement.
“On the other hand, few protestors can be found in the streets of Beijing, and no true reflection can be found on the different views that the Chinese might have on China’s worrying economic policy,” he wrote.
He added that “one of the biggest newspapers in China got away with the offer to publish” his article, but he did not specify what newspaper it was.
Experts warn that Republicans are making female voters look at them for the midterm elections with the Kavanaugh case.
Experts have warned of negative reactions, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections, because many Republicans have endorsed and defended Brett Kavanaugh, the nominee of the Supreme Court, who has acquitted the accusations of sexual harassment.
Very strong sentiments have been around this issue and most Republicans have already publicly shown that they wanted to start a voter turnout.
“There’s no way to back up these things,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted the appeal of Jeff Flake, a senior Republican lawmaker in Arizona, at the last minute for an FBI investigation sufficient to silence angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget it tomorrow and they will not forget it in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, an adviser and spokesperson for the free movement group MoveOn, said in a statement.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is approaching!" as they protested in the corridors of the Elderdom when the Republicans who ran the ruling committee decided to continue with Kavanaugh's nomination, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
"The interest and fervor of the electorate will go out of all its power," Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news website.
“People will say that the interest has already been great and it’s true.
But he could be bigger, especially among female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18-29 years old, who dislike the president, but rarely vote."
Analysts predicted a setback if Republicans pressed to have Kavanaugh confirmed, even before Ford’s testimony in which she described her accusations of sexual assault from him.
“This has become a big mess for the Republican Party,” Michael Still, a former member of the Republican Party’s National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be allowed to sit in the class, it’s also about how Republicans have handled this and how they have dealt with it,” Guy Cecil, chairman of the Priorities Committee, told a news conference.
However, Americans seem to disagree with who should believe the testimonies of both Ford and Kavanaugh, and the vast majority support the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents believed the Ford testimonials, while 35 percent said they believed the Kavanaugh testimonials.
In addition, 38 percent of respondents said they believed Kavanaugh likely or certainly lied in their testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s appeal, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford and by at least one other woman, Deborah Ramirez, according to a Guardian report.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh had attacked her when she was 17 and that he had been under the influence of alcohol.
Ramirez says Kavanaugh wore his genitals in front of her when they were both at a party at Yale University in the 1990s.
The man who invented the internet has plans to start a new internet to fight against Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the man who invented the internet, is going to set up a hacking company to fight Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is a company based in Solid, an open-source Berners-Lee site.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have permission to access any information.
In a private interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was "world government."
“We’ve got to do this now,” he said of the company.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses technology from Solid to enable people to create their own “personalised online data store” or POD.
You can have a list of contacts, project lists, calendars, music collections and other personal and work-related devices.
It is similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify being all available in one browser and all at the same time.
The unique thing about the personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user who can access any information.
The company calls it “personal power grabbing by using data.”
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company provides access, processes and appropriate skills to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
Now, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers who were hired as developers to work on the project, and a group of developers in volunteering.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could create their own standalone apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team should not be in talks with “Facebook and Google about whether to initiate a complete change that would put their current business model on the head in one night.
“We’re not asking for permission.”
Berners-Lee wrote in an article published Saturday on Medium that Inrupt’s goal was “to create energy in business and an ecosystem that helps protect the honesty and quality of the new web that is built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation of the Open Data Institute, even as he embarks on Inrupt.
“I’m full of optimism for the next season of the network,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Priest and holder of the Victory Cross from the First World War honored
The only English priest to be honored with the Victory Cross in World War I as a soldier has been honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Séré Bernard Vann, who held the rank of lieutenant in the army, received the cross on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was secretly shot four days later and was never informed that he had received the highest honour of the British Army.
Two of his grandchildren unveiled a memorial to him in a wreckage in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his great-grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "remarkably symbolic" that the monument had been unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's funeral.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Vann led his army across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from parachute and machine guns."
Later, he ran to the line of fire and with "great courage" led the line forward before colliding with a parachute of his own team and overturning three soldiers.
He was assassinated by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his heroic grandfather was “something I could never do, but something that makes a man humble.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wreath after the wreathing, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honoured to be involved in the wreckage" and added that "the deaths of a true hero are shown with the support that so many show."
MMA fans watched all night to watch Bellator 206, got instead to see Gurru pig
Just imagine waking up all night to see the overcrowded Bellator 206, just to be denied seeing the main event.
On the agenda were 13 battles from San Jose, of which six were on the main list and they were broadcast live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 o’clock in the morning, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to fight, British audiences received an unexpected turnaround when the broadcast turned into Gurru gris.
Some were dissatisfied after waking up all night to watch the battle.
One Twitter fan described the changes in the children’s material as “some sort of sick joke.”
“According to official rules, the material was not suitable for viewers at six in the morning so they had to switch to children’s material,” Dave Schwartz, vice president of marketing and communications for Bellator, said when asked about the broadcast.
"Gurra gris, yes."
Scott Coker, CEO of Bellator said they would review their schedules and take viewers into account in the UK in the future.
“I think when I think about the show that we could probably sort this out,” Coker said.
“But it’s six o’clock in the morning there on Sunday and we can’t get out of it until Sunday at our time, which is Monday with them.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, when it came to broadcasting, numerous text messages were sent back and forth, and not all of them were friendly.
We were trying to fix this, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn’t, it was an obvious problem.
I promise it won’t happen next time.
We limited the evening to five battles instead of six, as usual, but we tried too much and got out of our way.
This is an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley finds himself ‘unsatisfied’ because of his sexuality
Olympic enthusiast Tom Daley says he has felt dissatisfied with other people in his upbringing because of his sexuality, but that it has encouraged him to succeed.
The 24-year-old Daley said he didn’t realize he was “different” until he went to middle school.
In the Desert Island Discs radio show on Radio 4 channel, with Lauren Laverne, Daley said he was talking about the rights of homosexuals to grant others "of."
He also said that his role as a parent has diminished his interest in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular cast member, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Daley could be cast in Laverne's first episode and said he felt he was "a lesser man" than everyone else when he was a child because "it was not accepted in the community to be liked by both boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, these feelings of feeling inferior have given me the strength and the strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so he wouldn’t cause anyone disappointment when he finally came up with his sexuality.
The double Olympic medalist has made a big contribution as an LGBT supporter and used his participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more nations to legalize homosexuality.
He said to let himself be heard because he felt he was lucky to be able to live publicly without punishment and wanted to provide others with “of.”
The three-time world champion said it had "surprised him" to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he first met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year but said the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you go through so much at such a young age” – when he participated in his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was hard to find peers who had experienced similar success and difficulties.
The couple adopted a baby in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "all views of life" had faded.
“If you had asked me last year, it’s all about winning a gold award,” he said.
“You know what, there are more important things than gold medals at the Olympics.
"Robbie is my Olympic prize."
His son is baptized in the head of Robert, his father who died in 2011, at the age of forty, after having been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not agreed that he would die and one of the last things he had asked about was if they had already got their tickets for London 2012 – because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him that he wouldn’t live long enough to sit in the front row,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until his breathing stopped and he was allowed to finally admit that he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I just knew that I had dreamed of this all my life, immersing myself in front of audiences at the home of the Olympics. It doesn’t feel any better,” he said.
It was also inspired by the choice of the first song - Proud by Heather Small - which had inspired him for the Olympics and still gave him goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 at 11:15 a.m. UK time.
Mickelson in bad shape and let sit on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will hit the score on Sunday as he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he has to find his old rhythm so that the score is not surrounded by bad memories.
Mickelson, who is playing for the 12th time in the competition, was allowed to sit in the class following the decision of manager Jim Furyk for the four-ball and four-game matches on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the hasser, as he has been so often before for the United States, the day of the five-time champion switched between being a kicker and practicing the playing-acts on the pitch in the hope of correcting what is bothering him.
Mickelson, 48, was never the shooter targeting the killers, and is not the best player for the Le Golf National golf course, where long shots often punish for bad shots.
And not only is the golf course a big challenge in itself, but Mickelson has to compete against Frances Molinari, winner of the British Open, in the ninth game on Sunday. Molinari is with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood on the team and together they have won all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, who are four levels below as they take the first game of 12 single-team games, achieve a good start, Mickelson's game could change creations.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his husband, but he could hardly say much else.
“He fully understood the role he had today, slapped me on the back and took me out and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of self-confidence.
He's in the Hall of Fame and he's been such a big hit for the teams before and this week.
I didn’t expect him to play two games.
I saw more for myself, but that’s how it ended and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo in a number of games played in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This could mark the end of a process in the Ryder Cup that has never achieved quite as much as other achievements on his record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 draws, but Furyk said his presence had a certain vague impact on the team.
“He’s funny, he’s cool, he’s fun, he’s fun to make jokes about people and it’s great to have him in the team room,” he said.
“I think the younger players enjoyed fighting him this week, too, and it was fun to see.
He gives so much more than just the golf game.”
Thomas Bjorn, leader of Europe knows that a lot of advances can go away quickly
European forward Thomas Bjorn knows from experience that a good lead for the last day of the individual race in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable experience.
Denmark first played at Valderrama in 1997, where the side under manager Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the U.S., but managed to claim the win at the end with the least possible scoring, with 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 wins.
“One constantly remembers that we had a big lead in Valderrama, we had a big lead in Brookline where we lost and in Valderrama, where we won, but only rightly so,” said Bjorn, seen here in the picture, after watching the 2018 season winning the National 5-6 and both teams won in the fixture.
The story will show me and everyone on the team that this is not over.
We'll all go ahead tomorrow.
Let's go and do everything right.
This is not done until all the levels are on the table.
We have our goal and it is trying to win this cup, we focus on it
I’ve always said this, I focus on the 12 players in our team, but we are very aware of our opponents in the other team – the best golfers in the world.”
Bjorn was delighted with how his players had been on the difficult pitch and added: “I never get ahead of myself in this.
Tomorrow is going to be different.
Tomorrow it’s the performance of the individuals that matters, and that’s another thing.
It’s great to play with a teammate when everything goes well, but when you play alone, everyone’s skills as a golfer are tested.
It is the message that needs to be sent to the players, to get the most out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he has to play his best game himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponents, Jim Furyk, will try to make his players stand out better in individual games rather than with companions, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furyk himself has experienced both sides in this major transition on the last day, but he was victorious with his team in Brookline but ended up losing when Europe carried out the "Medinah mine."
“I remember every fucking word,” he said when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 frontman, had encouraged his players for the last day.
“We need to play 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start fast like you did in Brookline and Medinah.
When the player is about to build up, it puts a lot of pressure on the games that are in the middle.
"We've arranged our players according to that and let them play as we feel will be the best tomorrow."
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the defense and play Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the European players in the first half of the games.
“I chose these players in this series because I think they cover all the way against,” Bjorn said of his choice of players in the individual race.
Germany's new military vessel postponed yet again
The latest German naval ship should have been built in 2014 to replace old Cold War-era warships, but it won’t be ready until first of all next year due to broken systems and rising costs, according to local news.
The construction of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the flagship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class military, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to a military spokesman who spoke to Die Zeit newspaper.
The ship was supposed to be taken advantage of by the navy in 2014, but serious problems after delivery ploughed the project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg Group, ordered by the navy in 2007, are to be replaced by the troops of the Bremen Group, which have come to their years.
They should be equipped with a powerful firearm, a wide range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and fault technology such as reduced radar, infrared, and sound signals.
Other important features are longer service life - it should be possible to use the latest ships for up to two years away from their home ports.
However, constant delays mean that these latest-generation warships — which are said to allow Germany to show its strength at sea — will become obsolete when they are finally taken advantage of, Die Zeit says.
The F125 came to the news last year when the German army officially refused to take over the fleet and returned it to the Blohm & Voss escape in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the navy has returned the ship to the manufacturer after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the split, but the German media spoke of many women seriously "deficient in software and hardware" who rendered the warship useless if it were sent to the army.
Bugs in the software were particularly important because a Baden-Württemberg-class warship will be controlled by a crew of 120, which is half that of a Bremen-class warship.
It was also revealed that the ship was too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the navy to make improvements to it in the future.
The 7,000-tonne Rhineland-Palatinate is thought to be twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from defects in the equipment, the cost of the entire project - including the training of the crew - has started to cause problems.
It is said to have reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), but was initially expected to be <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems facing the most recent ships are particularly important in light of the warnings that the superiority of the Germans at sea is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defense committee, acknowledged that the navy was indeed becoming a “competent ship wreck.”
The representative said that the problem had resolved over time, because older ships were taken out of service but no ships came in their place.
He regretted that none of the orders of the Baden-Württemberg group could be taken into use by the navy.
National Trust Nature Conservation Association Investigating the Secret Life of Leather Blazes
A new study, conducted in the Scottish Highlands, aims to find out how leather blocks use the landscape when they hunt for food.
It is hoped that the results will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide conservation actions in the future.
The study, which is led by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland Conservation Society, will monitor different types of leather bleach in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment will be installed at key locations around the area to monitor the behavior of the leather sheets over the period.
NHS staff and volunteers will also go on surveillance trips with handheld sensors.
Experts will analyze all the recordings to find out the frequency of calls, which the leather blocks give off, and what types do what.
Maps of habitats and reports will then be issued to create an accurate picture of their behavior on a geographical scale.
Rob Dewar, NTS’s Nightingale Advisor, hopes that the results will highlight which types of habitat are most important for the leather blocks and how they are used by each type.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, e.g. by creating sand and how best to maintain woodland for leather blocks and other related species.
Leather blush has decreased significantly in the last century in Scotland and throughout the UK.
They are at risk due to construction and development projects that affect their nests and reduce habitats.
Windmills and light can also pose risks, including fly paper and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks from domestic cats.
The skin is not really blind.
However, their ears are much more useful than their eyes when it comes to hunting urgently, because they are accustomed to hunting at night.
They use advanced geological surveying techniques to find insects and objects that are on their way.
The NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes leather blocks very seriously.
Ten experts work at the organisations, who carry out regular inspections, raids and sometimes rescue operations.
The association has even established Scotland’s first and only leather blossoming country at the Threeve Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of Scotland’s ten leather blossoming species have their home.
David Thompson, the manager of the estate, says he is the perfect area for them.
“The area here at Threeave is great for leather blocks,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of grown trees and lots of good living areas.
But there’s still a lot left about leather blocks, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
He emphasized the importance of checking with leather blocks before maintenance is carried out on housing, where the possible unintentional destruction of a single reindeer can kill up to 400 female leather blocks and young and destroy all leather blocks in the area.
Leather blocks are protected and it is forbidden to kill them, harass or disturb, or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish representative at the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot of unlearn about leather blocks and we don’t know how well many of their species are going.”
Ronaldo Rejects Allegations of Rape as Lawyers Prepare Lawsuit Against German Journal
Cristiano Ronaldo has called accusations against him of rape “fake news” and says people want to “give attention” by using his name.
His lawyers plan to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the accusations.
The president of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is said to have paid her $375,000 to remain silent about the incident, according to Der Spiegel on Friday.
A few hours after the charges were released, Ronaldo, 33, said in an Instagram Live video to 142 million of his followers that they were "fake news."
“No, no, no, no, no.
What was said today is fake news," the world champion said five times to the camera.
“These people want to draw attention to themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
It wants to be famous by using my name, but that’s part of the job.
I'm a happy person and everything is fine," the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the charges, which they have called "unacceptable disclosure of suspicions regarding privacy," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said Ronaldo would demand compensation for “a misdemeanor of the same magnitude as the seriousness of the crime, which is probably one of the most serious violations of human rights in recent years.”
The incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in the rectum, according to documents filed before Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo fell on his knees after the incident and told her he was a “99 percent good man” who fell in a temptation because of “1 percent.”
The documents state that Ronaldo agreed that the couple had engaged in sex but that they had both consented.
Mayorga says she went to the police and had pictures taken of her injuries in the hospital, but finally accepted a deal outside the courtroom because she was "deadly afraid of vengeance" and worried she would be "publicly humiliated."
She now says she wants to end the peace because she is still in shock after an alleged incident.
Ronaldo was close to going to Real Madrid from Manchester United when the rape was due to take place, and this summer he transferred to Italian giant Juve with a 100 million euro deal.
Brexit: Britain would ‘see for ever’ to lose carmakers
Britain would “see to it forever” if it lost its position as a global leader among car manufacturers after Brexit, says Greg Clark, the minister of commerce.
He added that it was "concerned" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a contract, the company would temporarily suspend its production plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the effects of delaying the border if a no-deal Brexit would actually cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis vehicles, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were shipped to other European countries.
“My opinion is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production facilities at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive officer at Burnaston.
Other British automakers have voiced concerns about exiting the EU without an agreement on how to conduct cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are that what car manufacturers say is a supply chain risk if a no-deal Brexit becomes a reality.
Toyota’s production line is based on a “last-minute” pick-up, with parts delivered every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made on order.
If the UK withdraws from the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruptions to the borders that the industry believes could lead to delays and shortages of components.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than its day warehouse in its factory in Derbyshire, the company said, and therefore production would stop.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May’s Chequers plan for a future relationship with the EU “was specifically aimed at preventing these views at the border.”
“We need to have a deal. We want to get the best deal that allows us to enjoy not only success in the present day, but as an opportunity that we can take advantage of,” he said in a BBC Radio 4 broadcast.
“The test data, not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers as well, shows that we need to be able to continue with highly effective approaches.
Toyota could not say how long their production would stop, but warned that in the longer term, increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a confidant of the Labour Society at the factory, said his colleagues were increasingly concerned: “My experience is that when these jobs disappear, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: “We have put forward a detailed and comprehensive plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
A meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House.
The White House said on Sunday that an important meeting between Donald Trump and Rod Rosenstein, an assistant prosecutor, could be "delayed again for a week" now the dispute over Brett Kavanaugh, a nominee for the Supreme Court, continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, a special counsel who investigates Russian electoral disputes, links between Trump’s aides and Russia, and possible impediments to the progress of the judiciary by the president.
For weeks, stories have been going on in Washington about whether Trump will fire state prosecutors and thereby endanger Mueller’s independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times said Rosenstein had discussed wearing a tape recorder to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of ousting the president from office using the 25th Amendment to the constitution.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
But last Monday, he visited the White House, amid news that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, but he was then with the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "preferably" did not want to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed so that he would not be at the same time as the hearing at the Elders' Judiciary Committee, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who has cherished him for sexual assault, held a hearing.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the elder’s vote.
Sarah Sander, Trump's spokesman, was on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she said: "No date has been set for him, it could be this week. I think it's possible that he will be delayed another week because of everything else going on at the Supreme Court.
But we do see, and it’s always a pleasure to inform the media.”
Some reporters disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked about the reason for this.
Sanders said a small number of meetings were not due to dissatisfaction with television reporters having "visionaryness," but she said, "I don't disagree with the fact that they have fiction."
She then gave evidence that the direct relationship between Trump and the media would increase.
"The president answers more questions from the media than any other president has ever done before," she said, without citing sources: "We've gone over these numbers."
“If the media has a chance to ask the President of the United States directly, it’s much better than talking to me,” Sanders said.
“We’re trying to do a lot of that, and you’ve seen us do a lot of that in the last few weeks, and it will replace media meetings when we can talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or media meetings with other leaders who visit him.
Media meetings with him alone are uncommon.
The president may have shown a reason for this in New York this week, when he showed off uninhibited and at times strange behavior in front of a group of reporters.
Minister of Health writes EU staff within the health system in Scotland due to concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working within the Health System in Scotland (NHS Scotland) to express the gratitude of the nation and wish it to continue working after Brexit has been breached.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter as soon as six months before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already promised to cover the costs of applying for a work permit for EU citizens working within the public service sector.
Ms Freeman wrote in her letter: “Over the summer, talks between the UK and the EU have continued over statements and are expected to take a decision this fall.
The British government has also been working on preparations if it is not possible to get out of a contract.
I know that this must be a very uncertain time for all of you.
That is why I want to reiterate how much I appreciate the work of all the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Partners from the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and know-how that strengthens and improves the work of the health service and benefits the patients and the communities we serve.
“Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Christion Abercrombie, a lineman for the Tennessee State Tigers, had to undergo emergency surgery after suffering head injuries in a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores team on Saturday, according to a report from Mike Organ, a Tennessee journalist.
Rod Reed, a Tennessee State supercoach, told reporters that the impact had been short-lived before the game.
“He came to the sideline and fell down there,” Reed said.
Trainers and nurses gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before he was placed on a lap and carried out for further examination.
A representative from Tennessee State, Chris Harris, a WSMV radio station in Nashville, Tennessee, said Abercrombie had undergone surgery at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that there was “no information on the nature or severity of the impact yet” and that the Tennessee State was trying to figure out when the accident occurred.
Abercrombie, who is in high school, plays his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had five papers in total on Saturday before he left, which increased his total number of papers to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp fees when they buy real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp fees when buying real estate in the UK. Excess will be used to assist the homeless, according to the new plan of the Content Group
The action will nullify the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters
Higher stamp duty will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The government plans to raise <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp fees when they buy real estate in the UK. Excess will be used to assist homeless people. Theresa May will announce this today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to nullify Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters by promising affordable housing and further taxing seniors.
Individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK will have to pay higher stamp fees, and excess will go into government operations to assist the homeless.
The increase - which is in addition to the current stamp duty, including the increase that was applied to two years ago on additional housing and real estate purchases for rent - could be up to three percent.
The government expects the increase to reach up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of new buildings in London are purchased by foreign entities, but this causes price increases and makes it harder for those who want to buy real estate for the first time to enter the market.
Many industrial areas in the country - especially in the capital - have become "friend villages" because of the number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in stamp duty to help more young people get their first home.
He accused a large construction company of keeping real estate prices high by buying land but not using it, and urged May to stop quotas on affordable homes to fix Britain’s “housing embarrassment.”
Mr Corbyn has announced a number of significant improvements in housing matters, including rent inspections and final discharges from rental housing without charge.
He also wants to give the council more power to build a new home.
Theresa May said: “I said last year that I would dedicate myself to the restoration of the British dream in my first season – that every new generation should enjoy a better quality of life.
And that includes fixing our unused real estate market.
The doors of the UK will always be open to those who want to live here, work and build their lives.
However, it may not be right that it is as easy for foreign parties and companies with headquarters abroad to buy a home as it is for decent British nationals.
For many, the dream of their own home has become too distant, and the shame that comes with homelessness is still too real.
Jack Ross: "My main goal is to coach Scotland"
Jack Ross, Sunderland’s coach, says it’s his “best goal” to become Scotland’s coach ever.
This 42-year-old Scotsman is now taking advantage of the challenge to breathe new life into the North-East club, which now sits in third place in the first division, three levels from the top.
He moved to Sunderland this summer after returning to the Scottish Premier League in the last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I had a knee injury and that was the end of it," Ross said in an interview with BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden often with my dad as a kid, and there’s always something that’s taken me back.
But that opportunity would only be available if I manage to train the team well.”
Former Ross coaches Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic club coach said he felt no fear of following in the footsteps of such famous names at such a large club, but had previously rejected coaching positions at Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“As it is, I will measure my success by thinking, ‘Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’
This club is definitely at home in the Premier League because of its structure and facilities," he said.
“It’s not an easy job to get him there, but I’d probably just look at myself as lucky here if I got the club back up there.”
Ross has only three years of experience as a coach, after a period as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and 15 months as part of a coaching team for the Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from falling into the third division, and turned St Mirren, who was about to fall into the division, into the division champion the next season.
Ross claims to be more confident now than he ever was in his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real time date,” he says of the period when he became coach of Alloa.
“I really thought the coaching job was right for me, even more than playing.
It sounds strange, because it went well for me, I had a decent income from it and enjoyed immeasurable success.
But change can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot every week.
I’m still going through it in terms of stress and pressure from work, but the coaching job just seems right for me.
I’ve always wanted to train and now I do, I’ve never felt better with myself in all my adult years.”

The best time for beer is at 5.30pm on Saturdays, according to a review
The heat wave this summer has proven to be a good fit for British bars that own a base, but the pressure on restaurant chains has increased.
Sales at pubs and bars rose by 2.7 percent in July, while sales at restaurants fell by 4.8 percent, according to figures.
Peter Martin, from CGA, which compiled the figures, said: “The continued sunshine and unexpected success of England at the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern as June, when bar sales increased by 2.8 percent, except for what restaurants were still selling less.
Salan fell by 1.8 percent at restaurants in June and worsened again in July.
The pubs and bars, which mainly target the beverage sales, stood for a long time with more buzz while restaurants went downhill.
Pubs that sold food also had a hard time in the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
People just wanted to go out for a drink.
The sale of drinks at pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent for the month, while the sale of food decreased by three per cent.
Paul Newman, of RSM, said: “These results are a continuation of the fluctuation we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of important social events or sporting events are still the biggest factors when it comes to sales at markets outside the home.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups are still in difficulty, although the sales reduction of up to 4.8 percent per month is particularly painful above the continued pressure caused by costs.
This long and hot summer could hardly come at a worse time for food outlets and only time will reveal whether tempered temperatures, as we have had in August, will improve the situation."
Total sales growth at pubs and restaurants, including at newly opened venues, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting how the openings have been possible.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the control company with sales in the British pub and restaurant industry, collects and analyzes data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is the industry benchmark for the industry.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
One in five children, all under the age of 11, have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, according to survey results.
A survey that reached 20,000 students showed an increase in "serious Insta" pages
The news has heightened concerns that sexual material is being published.
Twenty percent of students say they have a “main” account that they show to parents
One in five children, all under the age of 11, create secret accounts on social media that they keep secret from adults.
A survey that reached 20,000 students showed a huge increase in “smart Insta” accounts – which is a reference to the Instagram website.
The news has heightened concerns that sexual material is being published.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean “main” account to show to parents, as well as secret accounts.
A mother, who fell on her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website, found a teenager who encouraged others to “rape me.”
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the House of Representatives (HMC), found that 40 percent of children aged 11-18 had two accounts and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, chairman of HMC, said: “It’s a concern that so many young people are tempted to create an area online where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" of the Scottish Athletics Committee
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as the head of the non-executive committee at the annual general meeting of the board.
Doyle is Scotland’s most successful freelance athlete and Ian Beattie, chairman of the committee, said the nomination would be a great opportunity for those who led the sport to benefit from its vast international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect within sports communities in Scotland, the UK and internationally, and we are sure that sports in Scotland would earn a lot from getting it on the committee,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am very interested in speaking on behalf of the athletes and hope that I can make my mark and help lead the sport forward in Scotland.”
The American, who won between 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, but has a total of four Olympians, now a regular visitor to the BBC, was paralyzed after having a short-term blood clot.
He tweeted: “One month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I was even and then to what extent.
It’s been a tough job, but I fully recovered, learned to walk again and do sports today!
Thank you for your words of encouragement!”
Breast pump advertisement, which compares a mother with a cow, causes an online dispute
A company that produces breast pumps is now referred to online because of advertisements that carry lactating mothers to cows that are milked.
The company Elvie published a utilised advertisement to mark the launch of what is said to be "the world's first sonic breast pump that can be worn outside". The advertisement is inspired by music videos and to show the freedom that the new pump provides to mothers who are pregnant.
Four real mothers dance in a heap full of hymns and cows with songs such as, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you don't see a tail on me" and, "If you don't notice it, it's not the itch but the boobs on me."
The appendix continues: “Pump, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump, I pump milk from the Christmas trees.”
However, the advertisement, which appears on the company’s Facebook page, has caused an online review.
The video has 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and has received unequal responses from viewers, who say many are dealing with the “shock” that accompanies the dairy industry.
“Really bad decision to use a cow to advertise this product.
Just like us, they need to be calfs and bears to produce milk, except what the calves are taken from them only a few days after they are born," he said in one commentary.
Elvie breast pump fits comfortably in the breastfeeding holder (Elvie/Mother)
Another spectator wrote: “It is quite difficult for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another added: “This advertisement is completely out of step with the times.”
Others defended the ad, and one woman admitted that her song’s aspect was “disgusting.”
“I think that’s a great idea.
I would have bought it if I had a baby.
I felt like a cow when I was pumping milk out of me.
The advertisement is a little crazy, but I took it as it is.
“It’s a great idea,” one of the readers wrote.
Another said: “This is a fun advertisement that is aimed at mothers who pump milk (often at work or inside the toilet) and feels like a ‘cow.’
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry.”
At the end of the advertisement, the women’s group shows that they were all dancing with the breast pumps hidden in their breast pockets.
The idea behind the advertising campaign is based on the fact that many women say that they feel like cows when they pump out milk.
The Elvie pump, however, is quite quiet, has no wires or wires and fits comfortably on top of the bra, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their child and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, co-owner and CEO of Mother, said: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a notable promotion that would evoke controversy.
By mimicking women we cows, we wanted to direct the casting light to the breast pump and all its challenges, and show even in a fun and familiar way how much freedom the new pump would provide.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has been on the news.
During London Fashion Week, two mothers of two children showed up at a fashion show for the designer Morta Jakubowski, while she was using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children quietly transported to tents at Texas border
The number of immigrant children in detention has increased abruptly even though the number of those crossing the border on a monthly basis has remained somewhat the same. Part of the reason is that the harsh speeches and policies the Trump administration has put forward have made it more difficult to arrive.
As a rule, the foster parents have been unregistered immigrants themselves, and are afraid of putting their chances of staying in the country at risk, by offering to breastfeed a child.
The risk increased in June, when public authorities announced that potential foster parents and other adults within the home would have to submit fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with the immigration control.
Last week, Matthew Albence, head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before the elderhood and said that his organization had arrested a number of people who were seeking to raise single children.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested were not on the record.
“Nearly 80 percent of those who are either foster parents or in a foster home are illegal in the country, and a large part of them are illegal immigrants on the record.
“So we’re going to continue to look for those individuals,” Mr. Albence said.
In an attempt to work out the children's cases more quickly, representatives notified new rules requiring some of the children to appear in court within a month of being placed in custody, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous criterion, according to staff working in the alert.
Many of them will appear through video meetings, rather than in their own person, to justify their legal status before the judges in immigration cases.
Those children who are convicted of incapacity to enter the country are immediately sent out of the country.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violence or an escape attempt, according to emergency workers and reports published by the system in recent months.
Spokesmen said these problems were even more likely in a larger institution such as in Tornillo, where it is likely that no one will notice even if the child is difficult, because of how many they are.
They added that moving the children to the camp without giving them enough time to prepare them spiritually or to say goodbye to friends could increase the impact that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria says U.S., French, Turkish ‘army squads’ to withdraw immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also said in his speech to the U.N. General Assembly that Syrian refugees should return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also plays the role of Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign troops were illegal in Syria, under the false pretext that they were fighting terrorism, and that "they will be treated accordingly."
“They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions,” he told the House.
Moualem insisted that “the war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have had to flee their homes.
He said Damascus would continue “to wage this holy struggle until we cleanse all the Syrian territories” of both terrorist groups and “all illegal aliens.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, most of whom are training and advising both Kurdish troops and Syrian Arabs who are fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in this war-torn country.
As for the refugee issue, Moualem said the conditions were good enough for them to return and he taught “some Western countries” to “spread out unreasonable fear” that encouraged refugees to stay away.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their re-entry,” he said.
“They’re creating politics out of something that should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide any funds for reconstruction in Syria unless there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The U.N. says a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up neutral zones at the last major stronghold of the opposition has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented large-scale attacks by Russian-backed Syrian troops on the three-million-strong province.
Moualem, however, stressed that the deal had a "clear deadline" and expressed hope that military operations would target jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front, which is affiliated with Al-Qaeda, and that they "were wiped out."
U.N. envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to come to the first meetings with a new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition, to draw up a post-war government plan for Syria and pay the price for the elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that her work should be limited to "passing the provisions of the current government," and warned of all interventions.
Reasons Why Trump Will Win Another Electoral Period
According to that statement, Mr. Trump would win the 2020 re-election unless the indictment and shock put an end to his presidential career, as many liberated spectators are likely to expect.
What would be the most dramatic end to the president’s career ever?
As it turns out, the audience is not exhausted.
As of 2014, viewership at the best time has more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN, and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the best time, an increase from 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” has peaked viewers with up to 3.5 million viewers on major news.
“It’s a fire that people are lurking at, because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, director of ABC’s Designated Survivor drama series, about a government employee who becomes president after the House of Representatives is destroyed in an attack.
Nell Scovell is the author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told her that he was going to elect Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he's coming to make me laugh,'" Miss Scovell said to me.
There's a lot of fun in the mess.
However, unlike what is shown on television, the stories from Washington could determine the fate of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can unite and the health of the international economy.
Only those spectators who enjoy what the master privileges have the ability to stop watching.
And yet this is more than being an informed citizen when one looks at the sixth time a group of experts argues the use of Bob Woodwards on "very close" authors for his book "Fear," or $15,000 jacket of ostriches worn by Paul Manafort.
I’ll never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"A part of what he does to annoy a person feels like a reality show, is he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars," as he talked about the day's work.
You can’t lose one thing, or you’ll lose the other.
When I reached out to Mr. Fleiss, there was 26 degrees of heat and sunshine outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he stayed indoors and watched MSNB while he was recording CNN.
He couldn't get away, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to testify before the Elders' Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was in sight.
“I remember when we were making all these crazy things in the old days and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out that people were right.”

Money to flow out in the most delicate mid-term elections
It’s no surprise that Pennsylvania’s 17th constituency sees the money flowing, thanks to a reorganization of constituencies that led to two representatives competing for the same seat.
The newly reorganized Pittsburg area sends out Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another constituency in special elections last summer.
Lamb opposes another representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is now the representative of the old 12th constituency in Pennsylvania, which is heavily affected by the new 17th constituency.
The map of the constituencies was reorganized after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old constituencies were organized in favor of the Republicans and that it violated the constitution.
The competition in the new 17th constituency has been the beginning of a contest in the financing of electoral campaigns between the main funding actors of both parties, the Democratic Electoral Committee (DCCC) and the Electoral Committee of the Republics (NRCC).
Lamb became a notable name in Pennsylvania after Nauman won a special election in March for the 18th constituency in Pennsylvania, but many followed those elections.
Republicans had previously warmed that seat for more than a decade and Donald Trump, the president, won the constituency by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a bit of a head start.
The U.S. planned to punish El Salvador for its support of China, but since then it has ceased.
Imperialists noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little objection from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Juan Carlos Varela, President of Panama in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until the co-owners of the Trump management team left.
U.S. State Department officials decided to recall the U.S. ambassador to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the ministry in a statement earlier this month.
However, penalties were only contemplated against El Salvador, which is estimated to have received $140 million from the United States for aid work in 2017, including for drug control, development work and economic support.
The penalties, which included, among other things, a reduction in financial support and restrictions on the issue of residence permits, would have been painful for the Central American country, where there is a high level of unemployment and a high incidence of murder.
As domestic meetings continued, U.S. and Central American representatives postponed the Security and Economic Success Conference and were to follow a similar meeting held last year, which was considered to be a step forward in action to prevent people from fleeing.
But in mid-September, top officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, and thus ended all speculations about penalties against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence will now address the conference, which is due to take place in mid-October, as a sign of the importance of the conference in the eyes of the board.
The three U.S. envoys also quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton refused to discuss in detail the debates that the three U.S. representatives described, including two deputies, who agreed to discuss the in-house arguments against being anonymous.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst who works closely with the board and also spoke about the case against anonymity.
Learn the story
The next scandal could be Robert Mueller, a special counsel,’s report on possible actions by Mr. Trump to impede justice, but there is plenty of public evidence behind that allegation.
It is also said that Mr. Mueller also turned his research into whether Mr. Trump’s election campaign worked with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If Congress is to be governed by another party, Trump may need to be held accountable for it, at a time when he is preparing to meet his constituents again, and perhaps a quorum appointed by his peers.
However, these are extremely uncertain and I do not want to argue that the fall of Trump is unambiguous, nor the fall of his colleague in Europe.
We all need to choose, both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how long the struggle will last.
In 1938, German rulers were ready to plunder Hitler's power, only if Western countries had given him the resistance and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the ravages that followed.
The story revolves around such important points and faster or slower for the unstoppable progress of democracy.
The United States is facing a number of such important points right now.
What do we do if Mr. Trump fires Rod Rosenstein, the man who rules the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a bad position since this newspaper said that last year he had proposed to make covert recordings of the president and discussed whether he was incapable of office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the news from the Times is not correct.
“How will we respond if the newly requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not thorough or fair, or if he is confirmed in the Supreme Court seat despite credible allegations of sexual misconduct and dishonest testimony?”
And above all, will we elect a midterm parliament that will let Mr. Trump shoulder responsibility?
If we fall on these tests, democracy will have to tire out for a long winter.
But I don’t think we will fall, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was Jewish from Czechoslovakia and was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi government and had previously sat in my ambassadorial residence.
She survived, moved to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the table with the hook cross.
With such a legacy, how can I look beyond positive eyes to our future?”

Graham Dorrans, Rangers teammate, bright vision for the game against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory against the Austrians will put them in a strong position to emerge from the G-group of the European Cup. The Rangers made a stunning draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing his first game of the season until the game against Villareal ended with a 2-2 draw, but he believes the Rangers can use those results as a springboard for better results.
“It was good to get this point for us, because Villarreal is a strong team,” Dorrans, 31, said.
“We started the game in the belief that we could achieve something and ended up taking one point.
Maybe we could have won in the end, but overall, the odds were probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half and we came strong in the second half and played better.
On Thursday, there will be another important evening for the European Cup.
Hopefully we can reach three levels but it will be a difficult game because they did well in their last game. But with the spectators supporting us, I am sure that we will endure this and get a positive result.
Last year was difficult, both because of my injuries and the changes that took place in the club itself, but now there is a good feeling on the spot.
The team is good and the boys are enjoying themselves, the training is good.
Hopefully we can go further now, put the last season behind us and achieve success."
Women lose sleep due to fear of losing their retirement savings
While participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few talked to their family members about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide survey said they discussed the cost of long-term care with their partner.
Only 10 percent said they would talk to their children about it.
“People want a family member to acknowledge it, but it doesn’t take the right steps to have those conversations,” said Holly Snyder, deputy head of the Nationwide Life Insurance Department.
That's how to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide care if you don’t make them your wishes light up with good forethought.
Talk to your counselor and your family about where and when you get care, because these options can change a lot in terms of cost.
Get your financial advisor involved: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for this cost.
Among the options you have to pay for long-term care are traditional life insurance with long-term care, mixed life insurance that pays out in cash, to help pay the cost, or self-insurance with your own money – as long as you have it.
Prepare all legal documents: Avoid legal disputes in advance.
Get a health care provider so that you can nominate someone you trust to oversee your health care, and ensure that health care professionals will respond to your requests if you can’t say them directly yourself.
Also, consider getting a procurer for your finances.
You would choose someone you trust to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure that your bills are paid if you can’t do it yourself.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly father or mother landed in an emergency and is on the way to a hospital.
Can you answer questions about drugs and allergies?
Provide this information accurately in a written schedule so that you are ready.
“It’s not just about the finances, it’s also about who the doctors are,” Martin said.
“What are the drugs?
Who will take care of the dog?
“Be prepared for that plan.”
Man shot multiple times with air gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with an aerial gun as he was on his way home on foot after having fun outside.
The victim is a man in his fifties and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Representatives describe the shooting, which took place at around 2:30 a.m. British local time, as a "random attack."
The victim did not see his assailant.
The man was not seriously injured and the police have called for witnesses.
Category: Earthquakes and floods in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in the aftermath of a powerful earthquake and flood in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Since all communications are down, aid workers have not been able to provide any information from Donggala County, which is an area north of Palu and is closer to the center of the earthquake, which was 7.5 on Richter.
More than 16,000 people were forced to leave their homes in Palu after an accident.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province and is located at the bottom of a narrow stream on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The estimated population was 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and flooding were about to take place.
Donggala is a county covering more than 380 km of coastline in the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, which is a sub-provincial area, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main industries in the Central Sulawesi region, especially in the Donggala beach area.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but most of them are in Morowali, which is on the coast of Sulawesi.
Floods have hit Palu and Donggala several times in the last century, according to the Indonesian disaster agency.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed in the floods and hundreds of houses in Donggala were destroyed.
There will also be a flood in the western part of Donggala in 1996, where nine people died.
Indonesia sits on the active fire ring of the Pacific and there are regular earthquakes.
Here are the major earthquakes and floods of the past few years:
2004: A major earthquake struck the western coast of the Aceh province in the northern part of Sumatra on 26 December, triggering a flooding of 14 countries, killing 226,000 people across the Indian Ocean coastline, of whom more than half were in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes passed over the west coast of S<0xC3><0xBA>mötra in late March and early April.
Hundreds live on the island of Nias, off the coast of S<0xC3><0xBA>mötra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 on Richter struck the southernmost island of Juba, Indonesia, causing a flood on the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 on Richter struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the province in western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 on Richter struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, and raised up to 10 meters high floods that destroyed a number of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: The basic earthquake raged over Pidie Jaya County in Aceh and caused destruction and outrage as people are reminded of the destruction in the deadly earthquake and flood in 2004.
No flooding occurred this time, but over 100 let life have buildings collapsed.
2018: Huge earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed hundreds of buildings and tens of thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded on the island.
S<0xC3><0xA1>ruh Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of S<0xC3><0xB3>ruh Palin, a former Alaskan governor and presidential candidate, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, a 29-year-old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, for trying to prevent a domestic violence report and protesting against arrest, according to a report by state police in Alaska, published on Saturday.
According to a police report, Palin picked up the phone from a friend of hers when she tried to call the police to report the alleged offence.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su station where he is awaiting trial, and he is being held against a $500 bail, according to a report from KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, declaring that he was "not guilty, not guilty" when asked to plead guilty or innocence, according to the news station.
Palin is charged with three Class A offences, which means he could be sentenced to prison for up to one year and must pay a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a Category B offence, which is punishable by one day in prison and a $2000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is now in the hands of the Attorney General of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstructing the notification of domestic violence and carrying weapons under the influence of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His wife told him that he had rubbed her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by a group of infidels in 2016 after she blamed her son’s violent behavior for his military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and Floods in Indonesia: Hundreds Killed
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake, which was 7.5 on Richter, triggered a flood and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication systems are down and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred in the middle of Sulawesi Island, northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos that show when the incident took place are now being circulated on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when a flood struck the beach.
Prosecutors sue for a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist attacker in New York City
New York prosecutors want the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected of having participated in a terrorist attack in New York City, which killed eight people. This is a rare punishment that has not been used in the county for violations of the 19-state law since.
Saipov, 30, is believed to have rented a Home Depot truck to attack people on a bike path along the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan. He drove down there pedestrians and cyclists in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed eight “willing” victims and caused serious bodily harm “willing”, according to the declaration of intent to apply the death penalty, which was registered in the southern region of New York.
Both of these defendants can lead to a possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Many weeks after the attack, the state court charged Saipov with 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for criminal purposes, which is usually used by prosecutors in prosecutions against organized crime organizations. Also, Saipov was charged with rape.
The attack involved “a number of premeditated plots,” the accusers said, describing Sapiov’s actions as “terrible, cruel, and immoral.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov was responsible for injuries, injuries and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnunucco," he said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been decades since the southern part of New York City took the last death penalty for treatment.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with murdering two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The death penalty was last carried out in a New York court in 1953, against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, spouses who were executed after being convicted of spying for the Soviet Union in the Cold War two years earlier.
The couple were both killed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, showed no signs of repentance in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he was happy with what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he had the idea of the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He has declared his innocence in all 22 counts of the indictment.
David Patton, one of Saipov's public defenders, said they were "of course disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to ask for the death penalty instead of accepting a plea against life imprisonment without the possibility of an experiential solution will only prolong the impact of this event for all concerned,” Patton said.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A member of the Conservative Party says NIGEL FARAGE should conduct negotiations on a Brexit deal.
Nigel Farage vowed to “mobilize the people’s army” today in protest at the congress of the Conservatives.
This former leader Ukip said that politicians should be "under pressure" from doubters about the EU, at the same time as one of the MPs, Theresa May, suggested that he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone told the Birmingham protests that Britain “would have left” now if Mr. Farage was the leader of Brexit.
But the challenge that May faces in reconciling deep disagreements between her own teammates came to light even more, with supporters who want to stay in the EU taking part in other anti-Brexit protests in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his Chequers plan on track and is being criticized by those who are against Brexit, those who are against it, and the EU.
Allies said it would continue to fight to reach an agreement with Brussels despite opposition – and force those who oppose Brexit and the Labour Party to choose between its plan and “unhappiness.”
Mr. Bone told the Leave Means Leave protest in Solihull that he wanted to “unleash the Chequers plan.”
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been allowed to participate and shoulder responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was in power, we’d be out now,” he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: “I will support Brexit but we have to get rid of the Chequers plan.”
He explained his opposition to the EU and said: “We do not fight in world wars to serve others.
We want to write our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bone pointed out from evidence that public opinion had changed since the 2016 election: “The idea that the British public had changed their minds and wanted to remain silent is absolutely false.”
Andrea Jenkyns, a staunch supporter of Brexit, was also at the protest and told reporters: “I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers program is unpopular with the public and the opposition will not vote with it. It enjoys unpopularity among our classmates and the activists who are on the streets and elect us.
Do that, stop the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a direct message to May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep the job when they keep their promises.”
Mr. Farage said that politicians would have to be “under pressure” if they were to fail in the decision taken following the vote in 2016.
“It’s about trust between us — the people — and our political party,” he said.
“They want to try to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them, ‘We won’t let you guys get away with this.’”
He added in his message to the crowd: “I want you to let your political party, which is about to betray Brexit, feel pressure.
We are mobilizing the public army in this country that gave us the victory in Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
At the same time, EU supporters held a protest rally in Birmingham that ended with a two-hour protest meeting in the city centre.
A small group of activists waved the flag against Brexit after the group was set up over the weekend.
Adonis Lavard, from the Workers’ Party, joked to the Conservatives about the security issues that came up in the party’s phone app when the conference opened.
“It’s the people who tell us that it can have all the computer systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for a border without barriers, for free trade with Ireland without borders,” he added.
“This is a complete shock.
“There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he said.
Warren intends to “seriously consider” bidding for the presidency.
Elizabeth Warren, a senior U.S. congresswoman, says she plans to “consider seriously supplying the presidential office” after November’s election.
A report from the Boston Globe says the Massachusetts Democrat discussed his future at a civic meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who has rarely criticized US President Donald Trump, is bidding for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump’s 2016 election campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been at the center of speculation that she could run against Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th in the form of a citizens’ meeting with residents in her constituency, since Trump took office.
One of the attendees asked her if she intended to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for “women to go to Washington and get our government, and then we need a woman as a leader.”
Arrest after deadly LSU shooting of Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that she had arrested one suspect in the case of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims, but he was shot to death on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, a 20-year-old at a news conference at 11 a.m.
She had previously posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying a man who was seen on the tape.
Sims, 20, was shot to death near the Southern University campus early Friday.
“Wayde Sims got a gunshot wound to the head and died from it,” Murphy J. Paul, the police chief, told media on Saturday, according to a report from 247sports.
Wayde came to his ward's friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to having been on the scene, with a gun in his forearm, and admitted to having shot the Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested and taken into custody by the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims was two meters tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, He played in 32 games, of which 10 in the starting team in the last season and played an average of 17.4 minutes, scored 5.6 points and scored 2.9 rebounds in each game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after Sebastian Vettel gives him the victory at the behest of their team.
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas took a seat in front of Lewis Hamilton before the start on Saturday, that orders from the Mercedes team would play a big part in the race.
Bottas got off to a good start and left Hamilton almost after he secured his position in the first two bends and invited Vettel to fight against his teammates.
Vettel went first in the pit and let Hamilton drive into the traffic at the end of the group, but that should have been able to settle the results.
The Mercedes car went into the pit one lap later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton emerged after a close battle in which the Ferrari driver was forced to leave the inner side after being in danger of being left, after defensive attempts in the third turn.
Max Verstappen started back in the group and was in seventh place at the end of the first round, on his 21st birthday.
He then led the majority of the race as he postponed the change of tires to try to finish quickly and advance from Kimi Raikkonen to reach fourth place.
He finally went into the pit in the 44th round but could not increase the speed in the remaining eight rounds, and Raikkonen took the fourth place.
this is a difficult day because Valtteri stood up beautifully all weekend and was a true gentleman to let me out.
The team has been great to achieve this success," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad physique.
U.S. President Donald Trump joked at a meeting of senior congresswoman Dianne Feinstein on Saturday over her claim that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, on the charge of Brett Kavanaugh, a nominee for the Supreme Court.
The president spoke at a meeting in West Virginia, but did not speak directly to Ford’s testimony before the Elders’ panel, saying instead that what was going on in the Elders’ Assembly showed that people were “wounded and cruel and untrue.”
“The only thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has been going on in the last days in the elderhood, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and angry and cruel and untrue,” he said.
“When you see the posts and the leaks and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you miss this?
Do you remember her answer... you leaked the document – “Oh, ha, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't cover it."
Now, wait a minute.
"No, we're not," he said, squeezing after the old man.
The letter was sent to Feinstein in July, where Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh came to light, and was leaked in early September. Feinstein denied that the leak had come from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn’t cover up her story,” Feinstein told the committee, according to a report from The Hill.
“She asked me to keep it private and I did what she asked me to do.”
But her denial didn’t seem to go well with the president, who said at the meeting on Saturday: “I’ll tell you, it was a really bad physique.
Maybe she didn't do anything, but it was the worst physical assault I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexually assaulting three women, and urged Democrats to use the accusations in their favor.
“They’re determined to get back in power, no matter what methods have to be applied.
You see the cruelty, the immorality, they don't care who they hurt, who they need to take over to gain power and control," the president said, according to a news report from Mediaite.
Elite League division: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars added for their loss on Friday in the Elite League league against the Belfast Giants, by winning the next game after, 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants received early two-point lead-offs from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized for the home team, but Dwyer later re-entered the Giants.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee and two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
This was the third loss of the season for the team of Adam Keefe in the Elite League, but it had won Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth game between the teams during the season, and the Giants had won the games three times before.
Dwyer scored the first goal in the fourth minute at 3.35 a.m., following a support broadcast by Kendall McFaull. David Rutherford then made a support broadcast when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
It was then a lot to be in the first minutes and Sullivan came back into the game when the clock showed 13.10 and Cownie then equalized after a support broadcast by Matt Marquardt in the fifteenth minute.
Dwyer managed to make it to the Giants for the first half when he scored his second goal in the game at the end of the first quarter.
The home team came together and Bouchard equalised again after the goal when they were one man over in the 27th minute of another playoff.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together to help Nielsen pass Dundee for the first time late in the second quarter and he secured his team's victory with the fifth goal when the last half of the playoffs was over.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, take on Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller lays down his life to ensure that hundreds of passengers on a plane escape from earthquakes
An Indonesian air traffic controller has been hailed as a hero after he died in ensuring that a plane with hundreds of passengers could take over the air in its entirety.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake swept across the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a flood.
Large aftershocks continue to devastate the area and many are trapped under the ruins of the city of Palu.
The 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave, despite the fact that his comrades had fled the control tower that swung excessively at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He was about to stop to ensure that the Batik Air plane number 6321, which was on the runway when the earthquake struck, could certainly succeed in the air.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to a report from ABC News in Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“We are very sorry to hear this,” he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could exceed thousands, with the country's charity saying access is limited to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"It is believed that the number of dead is still increasing because many bodies are still under debris and cannot be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Up to six-metre-high waves have caused massive destruction in Palu, where a mass grave will be held on Sunday.
The army and passenger planes are working to bring in supplies and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute a ambulance comes with a body.
There is little about clean water.
“Small markets have been robbed everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, the head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is racing to find survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s already sad, but it could get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the removal.
“Are you ready?” she told CNN.
Earlier this year, an earthquake struck Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini says it's missing after plane crashes into lonesome
The airline, which owned a plane that crashed into a barn in Micronesia, now says one person is missing, having previously said that all 47 passengers and crew had been rescued from the attacking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that as of Saturday afternoon, it did not know about the disappearance of a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to questions about details of the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Boats in the area helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water as it tried to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday and that their condition was stable.
It is still unclear what caused the accident and what the exact sequence of events was.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane had landed in a lone stop ahead of the runway.
Witnesses believed that the plane had gone too far over the runway.
Bill Jaynes, a U.S. passenger, said the plane's approach was extremely low.
“It was really good,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others could go deep into the water and get to emergency exits in the sinking plane.
He said that the flight attendants had been frightened and screaming and that he had suffered minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said sailors, who were working close to building a bridge, also helped the rescue by using the inflated boat to ferry people ashore, before the plane sank into about 30 meters of deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Agency show that 111 people have died in plane crashes of PNG registered aircraft in the last two decades, but none of them were connected to Air Niugini.
An expert describes the timeline of the night that a woman was burned alive
Prosecutors closed their case on Saturday in a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an expert at the U.S. Department of Justice, was in court for several hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used mobile phone records to piece together the trips of the accused, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said she had received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contrary to his previous claims, according to a report from The Clarion Ledger.
When data showed that his cell phone was with Chamber at the same time he was said to have been with his friend, Michael Sanford, police went to Sanford to talk to him.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he had not been in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he was said to have been in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said it was "a joke, because my car was in Nashville."
Tellis was said to have known Chambers for about two weeks before she died.
Mobile phone records showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers’ death, Tellis had deleted her text messages, phone calls, and contact information from her phone.
"He wasted her life," Hale said.
The guards are expected to move their locker room on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the case to be brought to trial later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
Hipp jump trio wants to fight against a negative opinion towards the music genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, argues that hip hop has moved away from its origins as it contained a political message and discussed social issues.
They will look for the origins again and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently seen a surge in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
The other black man?!
New York City's Foster Sues Husband for Abduction After 'Prejudicial' Text Message
A foster mother in New York is suing her husband for illegally leaving her home after she received a text message from her mother complaining that she was “another black person.”
The couple therefore refuses to be presumptive and resembles the lawsuit to “financial torture.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dissatisfaction when she found out that her new fetus, Giselle Maurice, was black when she first went to work in 2016.
“NEEEEEIIIII OTHER BLACK MAN” wrote Mrs Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in text messages.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent them twice to Ms. Maurice.
After discovering her mistake, the "shameful" Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice and said that their former fetus, who was depressed, had been ill, and that she had expected to have a Filipino woman, according to a report from the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for one working day and then sent home in an Uber car.
Maurice is now suing the couple and wants to get compensation for the retirement, to the amount of $350 a day for the six-month job for which she had originally been hired, although no contract was signed.
“I wanted to show them that you shouldn’t do that,” she said in an interview with the Post on Friday, adding, “I know this is a difference.”
The couple have objected to the accusations that they are prejudiced and say that it was the right thing to do in the case to fire Maurice, because they felt they could not trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her a message that she wasn’t going to say.
She is not presumptuous.
We are not prejudiced people," her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But who would trust their children for someone after showing their donation, even if it was a surprise?
Your newborn baby?
Don't leave it like that."
Plasco likened the lawsuit to "treason," saying his wife had been on her way for seven months and was in "very difficult circumstances."
“Are you going to attack someone in this situation?
It’s not very beautifully done,” said Plasco, who works in the investment sector.
The case is still in court, but the public has made harsh remarks about the couple on social media and shamed it for its behavior and arguments.
Paddington’s publishers feared that readers might find it difficult to talk to a talking bear, a new letter said.
Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it was released.
"It's very funny now that we know of Paddington's tremendous success."
She said her father, who worked as a receptionist at the BBC before he was inspired to write a children's book about a small toy bear, had taken the rejection of his work with a calming positive, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's release would be a "must-see."
As for Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important family member," she added that her father had been quietly proud of his success in the end.
"He was a very quiet man and not used to riding himself," she said.
“But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like when a child performs something. You are proud of it even though you haven’t really done anything yourself.
I think he looked at Paddington's success in that way.
Although Paddington was his creation and his imagination, he always gave Paddington the honor."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone.
When she arrived her daughter had been taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors did everything in their power to save her life, but without success.
“Nad called me regularly and told me that the situation was very bad, that she was not expected to survive,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then Nad called me and said that she would die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'll be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The medicines, which the doctors had given her to keep her heart rate up, gradually lost their activity and were excreted from the body.
She had died a short time ago and this was the body giving up.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that this was all going to happen.
I couldn’t cry or cry, because I was surrounded by family and other people.
I had to control myself.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning her dead daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers who knew nothing of the difficulties she was experiencing.
“Nobody knew anything,” she said.
“I was crying and my tears were falling all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but during the flight I felt a lot of sympathy with Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Sorrowful Women Hang Up Messages to Prevent Suicide on Bridge
Two women, who had lovers who committed suicide, are now trying to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up a message on a bridge in Wales, with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call and get help with.
Tyler, the son of Ms. Davis, was 13 years old when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel like I need to feel every day,” she said.
Ms. Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and said her son had been a successful cook with a contagious smile.
He was known for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile could illuminate any room.”
He stopped working before he died because he was “sunk down into a very dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11-year-old, found his brother dead after taking his own life.
Ms. Davis said: “I am constantly concerned that this will be the result.”
Ms. Davis provided the message “to let people know that it is possible to go and talk to others, even a friend.
Don’t sit back and say nothing – you need to talk to someone.”
Ms. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Ms. Davies for years, lost her husband Mark to 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say anything about feeling bad or being depressed or anything like that,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
He was up at his worst on Christmas Day – when the kids opened their presents, he didn’t look them in the eye or anything.”
She said that his death would be a big blow to them, but that they would have to work out: “This rift was a hole in the family.
It breaks us apart.
But we have to keep going and fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs on the blue thread the FBI has its investigation
"I thought that if we could get something like what he asked for - a study of limited time and scope - we could perhaps reach a bit of a compromise," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be "breaking apart" in the middle of a conflict.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate the case?
It’s because of the timing.
The midterm elections are in just five weeks, on November 6th. If the Republicans go badly, as expected, it seriously weakens their attempts to get their husband elected to sit in the country’s highest court.
George W. Bush has been calling on senior congressmen to encourage them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and met his wife Ashley through him, but she was Mr. Bush’s sole advocate.
What happens after the FBI publishes its investigative report?
Voting will be held in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are sitting as is.
It is not yet certain whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes on the floor of the Senate, but that would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm him in the office of the Supreme Court.
The number of people fleeing North Korea “decreases” under Kim
The number of people fleeing North Korea and going to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, quoted by data from the South Korean Unification Council, said 1,127 people had fled last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher charges imposed by smugglers with people would be key factors.
Pyongyang has not issued any official statement.
The vast majority of those fleeing North Korea are invited to obtain South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most people flee to China, but it has the longest border to North Korea, and it is easier to cross them rather than the neutral zone between North and South Korea.
China sees the refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forces them to return to their homeland.
Communications between North and South Korea, which are still at war, technically, have improved considerably in the last month.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that revolved mainly around deferred nuclear deal talks.
This was after a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in coarse terms to work together towards the Korean nuke-free zone.
On Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, told U.S. businessmen about the lack of progress since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no certainty about the security of our country and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to unilaterally take down our nuclear weapons first," Ri said in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi Calls Brett Kavanaugh 'Mother's Disease' and Says He's Incapable of Doing the Job of Supreme Court Justice
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the minority in Congress, called Brett Kavanaugh, the nominee of the Supreme Court, "mother's disease" and said he was too skeptical to be able to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi dropped those words in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman had ever died like this, she would have been called a mother’s disease,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denies the accusations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both young.
In his inaugural speech, Kavanaugh was extremely emotional, and sometimes nearly screamed and choked his throat as he talked to his family and his school year.
He also publicly denounced the Democrats on the committee and called the accusations on his hands "a disgusting and organized homicide" that had been orchestrated by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not operate at the highest level, because he showed that he was biased toward Democrats.
“I think these claims and how he attacked the Clintons and Democrats show that he is incapable of the job,” she said.
Pelosi did not respond when asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh fired if he is confirmed and if Democrats get a majority in Congress.
“I’ll say this: if he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he’s not only incapable of being in the Supreme Court, he’s also in the court he’s in now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently serving as a judge at the Washington D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade abortion law, where he is considered a probationary judge.
At the hearing, Kavanaugh turned to the question of whether he would reverse certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“This is no time for a motherly, partial person to go to the high court and expect us to say, ‘A lot of it’s wonderful,’” Pelosi said.
And women need to use it.
These are just words, months and years of rage flowing out, and she does not leave without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Ms. Steinem said to me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s unusual, but you?”
She continued, “I got a lot of help from a woman who was the CEO somewhere and said that she was crying too when she got angry, but she had developed technology so that when she got angry and started crying, she said to her spokesperson, ‘You think I’m probably dead.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept crying.
And I thought it was great.”
Tears are allowed to express anger in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of my previous job in the office with the majority of men, where I started to cry with a fever that I could not express, an older woman came and took me to the nanny office. She was a cold boss that I had always been afraid of.
“Don’t ever see me cry,” she said.
They don't know you're scared.
They think you’re a baptist and they’re glad they’ve reached out to you.”
Patricia Schroeder had worked with Gary Hart when he was running for president, but she was then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught firing at a pass aboard a boat called Monkey Business (Apaspil) and pulled back his supply, Ms. Schroeder, full of outrage, felt that there was no reason why she could not consider offering herself for president.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she said, laughing at me, 30 years later.
“There were already seven other bidders and the last thing they needed to hold was an additional one.
Someone gave it the name "Mill White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the election campaign was long over, she was determined by the amount of funding, so she said she wouldn’t bid unless she was willing to raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters who gave $1000 to the men gave her only $250.
“Do they think I’m getting a discount?” she asked.
When she delivered her speech and announced that she would not formally present herself, she was so overwhelmed with feelings—gratitude to the people who had supported her, anger at the system, which made it so difficult for her to raise funds and direct her vision to the electorate—sharply to the electorate, to the electorate, and to the electorate.
"You might think I had a nervous breakdown," said Ms. Schroeder, remembering how the media reacted.
“I would have thought Kleenex would be my sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will be written on my head?
"She's crying?"
Reasons Why U.S.-China Trade War Could Be Good for Beijing
The first shots in the trade war between the U.S. and China were honorable, and while the war is far from over, guessing between countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by taxing China’s major exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest stigma came this week with new tariffs covering products worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), and taxing as much as half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has responded in the same currency each time and recently imposed 5 to 10 percent tariffs on U.S. goods worth $60 billion.
China has vowed to respond to U.S. tariffs, and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will collapse anytime soon.
To get Washington to jump, you need to let go of demands, but it would be too humiliating for Xi Jinping, the president of China, to officially bow before the United States.
Experts say, however, that if Beijing retains the rights to the games, pressure from the trade war with the United States could have had a positive effect on China in the long run, by reducing the mutual need of both economies for each other.
“The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could lead to situations that lead to economic collapse in either country is actually far more dangerous than audiences have ever admitted to,” said Abigail Grace, a senior researcher at New York University.
Syria 'prepared' for return of refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is prepared for refugees to return willingly to the country and seeks help to rebuild the country, which is now in a bad state after a seven-year war.
Walid al Moualem, the foreign minister, spoke at the UN General Assembly and said the situation in the country was improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer, thanks to success in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to come to normal conditions by building up areas that were devastated by the terrorists.
Everything is now prepared for refugees to return willingly to the country they were forced to leave because of the terror and unilateral economic decisions aimed at their daily lives and jobs.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
An additional six million, who still live in the country, are in need of assistance to maintain.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian authorities would be happy to accept assistance to rebuild the country.
He emphasized, however, that they would not accept aid depending on conditions or aid from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the Ryder Cup 2018 by defeating the US team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 points on the Le Golf National field outside Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on a European basis and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its crown when the team, led by Danish leader Thomas Bjorn, reached the 14.5 points it needed to defeat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who had the most difficulties of all the race, hit his starting shot in the water on the 16th hole, which is a pair of 3, and lost his game against Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone brightly in all his games and became 1 of 4 players to get the score 5-0-0, since the competition began using its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 against Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, but he was in the bottom of the ranking of the players in the European team.
Dustin Johnson, who is in the top of the list of the best golfers in the world, lost 2 and 1 against Ian Poulter from England who played possibly in his second race for the Ryder Cup.
Spaniard Sergio Garcia, who has played the Ryder Cup eight times, became the most successful European in the race with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t do anything else.
It has been a difficult year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I’m so happy to get the cup back.
This is about the team, and it was a pleasure to be able to help," Garcia said emotionally after Europe's victory.
He was awarded the John Rahm trophy, but he defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a one-sided game on Sunday.
“I was incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching him,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and is now registered with 13-21-3 in the competition for the Ryder Cup.
This is a strange result for one of the best players in history, who has won 14 major titles and is only in second place after Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had a hard time finding themselves on the pitch all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a good game throughout the race.
U.S. President Jim Furyk said after his team's performance, "I'm proud of them, they fought.
It was at some point in the morning that we put pressure on Europe.
We lost him down.
I'll take it up for Thomas.
He's a great leader.
All 12 of his players play very well.
We'll get back together, I'll work with PGA in the U.S. and name the Ryder Cup and we'll keep going.
I love these 12 guys and am proud to be their leader.
You have to take it up.
“They played better than us.”
