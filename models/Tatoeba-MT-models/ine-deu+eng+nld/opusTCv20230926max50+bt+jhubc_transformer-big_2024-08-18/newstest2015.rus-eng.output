<0xD0><0xA4><0xD0><0x90><0xD0><0x9D><0xD0><0x9E> Russia will hold a final Expert Session
The Federal Agency of Scientific Organizations (FANO of Russia) together with the Russian Academy of Sciences will hold the third Expert Session "Evaluation of the effectiveness of the activities of scientific organizations".
The meeting will be the final in a series of meetings held by the agency during the year, according to a press release submitted to the editorial board of Lenty.Ru.
At the third meeting, it is planned to summarise the work of the Expert Session for the year and to draw up a comprehensive list of indicators to assess the performance of scientific organizations.
Individual participants of the event plan to discuss the rules for the formation of expert groups responsible for carrying out the evaluation of the work of the scientific groups and the criteria for carrying out the evaluations.
The third expert session will be the final event in a series of events to form a single approach for all three academies to the methodology for assessing the performance of scientific organizations.
Over the past five months, we have succeeded in this, and the final version of the normative documents is being agreed.
Following the results of the next session, we must complete the formation of the processes of scientometric and expert analysis, agree on the stages and timing of the evaluation," said Elena Aksenova, Head of the Expert and Analytical Department of FANO Russia.
The event will be attended by representatives of more than one hundred scientific institutions of Russia.
As a result, the adoption of the resolution is expected.
The meeting will begin at 10 am Moscow time on September 16, 2014 at the following address: the city of Moscow, Solyanka Street, House 14.
Scientists have found a way to detect related stars
Astrophysicists at the University of California at Santa Cruz have studied turbulent mixing and its effect on chemical homogeneity in star clusters.
It is expected that the discovery of specialists will allow to search among the stars related, that is, arising from a single cluster.
The authors published the results of their research in the journal Nature, and they can be read briefly on the university's website.
The cause of the same chemical composition of nearby stars is the turbulent stirring in the clouds of gas that precedes the formation of stars.
Even if the born star then leaves the star cluster, its chemical composition can determine the place of birth and the region of formation of stars-relatives.
Previously, scientists had doubts that the evolution of a star outside the cluster could lead to differences in its chemical content from that of relatives in the cluster.
The results of the simulation carried out by astrophysicists show that such differences should not appear.
In their study, experts using a supercomputer simulated two streams of interstellar gas, which together formed a cloud.
This object, under the influence of its own gravity, transforms over several million years into a cluster in which protostars begin to form.
Scientists added label paints to the initial gas streams and found that rapid turbulent mixing in the cloud achieves a high degree of chemical homogeneity.
According to astrophysicists, their research proves that it is possible to search for relative stars by chemical composition, as well as to determine possible regions of formation of such objects.
Carrata police arrested a 20-year-old man after chasing a motorcycle at high speed
The motorcycle was confiscated after it was driven at a speed of 125 km/h in a zone with a speed limit of 70 km/h and through a bushland to escape from the police in Pilbara.
A transport police patrol in Carrata this morning tried to stop the blue motorcycle, finding that its speed reached 125 km/h when it left the service station on Batgate Road.
Police say the motorcyclist did not stop and continued on Burgess Road, then rolled into bushland, as a result of which the police lost sight of him.
The motorcycle and the person corresponding to the driver's description were spotted near the house on Walcott Way in Bulgar.
Carrata police have accused a 20-year-old man of refusing to stop and dangerous driving.
He is due to appear before the Carrata World Court on 23 September.
The motorcycle was confiscated and detained for three months.
The school year in the DPR will begin no earlier than October

George Webster, 28, was indicted at a High Court hearing in Glasgow.
He allegedly raped a woman at the Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire, on June 7, 2013.
Webster allegedly attacked her when she was “sleepless, unconscious, and unable to give consent.”
In addition, Webster is accused of raping another woman at the Golf View Hotel in Neurenberg, which is on the North Scottish Highlands, on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Ray has scheduled a hearing at the High Court in Edinburgh on 17 November.
Lavrov: Russia will not "knock the door" due to new sanctions and will not leave the WTO
Russia will not “knock on the door” in connection with the new sanctions.
This was stated today by the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation Sergey Lavrov, speaking to students and teachers of MGIMO.
As for our responses to a new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, I will not even reason, I will not even fantasize, because everything has to be specifically calculated,” he said.
And when we understand what the European and American partners will like this time, then we will make decisions on how to respond to it.
This will not be related to knocking on the door, some insults, misunderstood, - stressed the minister.
We will, first of all, rely on our interests, interests to protect our economy, social sphere, our citizens, our business and draw conclusions from the actions of partners for their adequacy, contractual capacity and reliability.
According to the steps that are taken in the area of sanctions, it is possible to judge very well what the partners are achieving, - continued the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry.
If they say in full voice that “these sanctions will also be painful for us, but we have to go for it to punish Russia,” it is probably not very adequate.
As for the WTO’s withdrawal of the Russian Federation in response to possible new sanctions, no.
We, on the contrary, want to learn more actively the tools of the WTO, including when it comes to trade disputes, - said Lavrov.
We have already used this toolkit to overcome what we believe is the EU’s discriminatory anti-dumping policy.
According to the Minister, Russia is accused of dumping and, at the same time, is applying anti-dumping measures against the Russian economy.
"We are ready to use WTO mechanisms and to defend our position on the inadmissibility of applying the rules of the third EU energy package retrospectively," Lavrov said.
How to properly use siren in the design of the garden?
Irina Okuneva answers the questions:
Since the siren loses its main attractiveness after discoloration, it is desirable to plant it together with other shrubs.
It blends well with many cultures.
And next to the siren you can and should plant both plants, decorative in other times, and flowering at the same time with it.
Another plus of the siren is that it provides a lot of opportunities for creativity.
You can form it with a stem tree of different heights, an improved shrub, a shrub with a wide base and even a resemblance to a garden bonsai - a tree with a bizarrely curved trunk.
Just choose the shape that best suits the design of your garden.
In Karelia, a resident of the Leningrad region was convicted for the sale of counterfeit money
As reported in the republican Ministry of Internal Affairs, the man engaged in his criminal fishing in the Olonets and Segeg districts.
In addition to Karelia, he committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused has already succeeded in inheriting in the Vologda region, where in the spring of this year he was sentenced to two and a half years in prison.
Later, the man appeared before the Olonets district court.
And to end the investigation of the crimes committed in our republic, was staged in Segeju.
In the course of the investigation, guilt has been proven for several episodes of the sale of counterfeit money related to the summer of 2013.
At the end of June this year, the materials of the criminal case with the indictment were sent to the court.
On Friday, August 29, the court decided to replace a four-year prison term with a general rule in the colony.
The sentence did not enter into legal force.
Recall that last week, two more buyers of fake money, which were paid by them in the shops of Petrozavodsk, were convicted.
Citizens of Azerbaijan also came to Karelia from St. Petersburg.
One of them is deprived of his liberty for five years, the other for four.
A fine of 500,000 rubles is imposed on each person.
The sentence has also not yet entered into legal force.
In Arkhangelsk celebrated the 73rd anniversary of the arrival of the first convoy "Dervish"
The rally, which took place in the regional center, was dedicated to the first Arctic convoy.
Dervish delivered military aid to the USSR from the United States and Great Britain.
In Arkhangelsk, the memorial rally was held at the cornerstone of the future monument to participants of the northern convoys, which is located on the embankment of Sedova in Solombala.
Representatives of the veteran organizations of Arkhangelsk, children from the cadet class gathered for the event.
We met for the first time twenty-three years ago when the foundation stone was laid.
But at the same time, today’s event is not a holiday, but a day of remembrance for those who have not returned to the sea,” said Boris Karpov, Chairman of the Council of Veterans of the Northern Seafaring.
Then the city wind orchestra performed at the event, and the pupils of the cadet classes gave the veterans flowers and marched with the flags of Russia and the banner of Victory.
The rally ended with the laying of flowers on the foundation stone.
The convoy itself consisted of five English ships and one Dutch transport loaded with strategically important raw materials (10,000 tons of rubber, 1,500 tons of shaped boots, lead, wool and a host of other equipment and equipment).
In addition, on board the ships were military equipment and weapons - 3,800 deep bombs and magnetic mines, fifteen fighter jets "Harrikain", in dismantled condition.
At the same time, the escort of the convoy consisted of 16 ships of the British Navy, among which there were two aircraft carriers.
The caravan of ships was not detected by the enemy and safely reached the destination - Arkhangelsk.
Of the 848 ships involved in the vital caravan operations, 126 transport vessels and about 50 military vessels were killed.

Recalling the very American ideal that labor rights are human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis proposed a bill that would protect trade unions as a civil right.
“Where there are trade unions, there are middle-class jobs,” says Allison, a Minnesota Democrat who is the Co-Chair of the Progressive Party Congress.
That’s why I’m proud to present the Workers’ Rights Enlargement Act along with the civil rights movement’s symbol, John Lewis.
This groundbreaking bill will give workers the same legal opportunity to discriminate against trade unions as it does against other forms of discrimination, stopping the forces of union opponents.
The amendment of the Labour Relations Regulation Act in such a way as to enable workers who face discrimination for participation in trade union organizations to seek justice in civil courts - and to receive compensation for damages and fines - is a reasonable and necessary initiative.
However, this is certainly not a radical initiative – at least by American standards.
In fact, the best way to figure out what Ellison, Lewis and the co-authors of the bill are proposing is to remember a very American thought.
Despite the attacks that unions have been subjected to in recent years — in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states across the country — Americans have once supported countries around the world in accepting, expanding, and respecting labor rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country simultaneously defended democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organize.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas McArthur and his aides helped the country adopt a constitution designed to ensure that Hideki Tojo's paramilitary autocracy was replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their trade unions play a role in shaping the new Japan, they included a text that explicitly recognized that “the right of workers to organize, to negotiate, and to collective action is guaranteed.”
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his aides helped the Germans write a constitution that ensured that Adolf Hitler's fascism was replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers will need to be organized and heard in the new state, the Germans included an article that openly stated: "The right to form associations in order to protect and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and every profession or field of activity.
Agreements that restrict or seek to infringe this right will not have legal force; measures aimed at these purposes will be recognized as illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was chair of the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the World Declaration of Human Rights, which in 1948 would be adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement, Roosevelt and its constituents had the right to include in their treaties a guarantee that "everyone has the right to
For generations, Americans have taken as a proper basis that labor rights are human rights.
When this country consulted other countries on how to create civil and democratic societies, the Americans explained that the right to organize trade unions – and to have this trade union participate as an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government institutions – must be protected.
Now that these rights are being attacked in America, it is indeed wise to return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to be organized and to have their voices heard in a free and open society.
As Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the trade union movement has not undermined the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the standard of living of millions, the trade unions miraculously created a market for industry and raised an entire nation to an unimaginable level of production.
Those who attack trade unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers us as well.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of civil rights protection to prevent discrimination against trade unions - has long since matured.
Keith Allison and John Lewis revive the ideals that have historically expanded America and made the promise of democracy a reality.
Judge Temporarily Blocks Law That Could Close All Abortion Clinics in Louisiana
In the U.S., a federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked the Louisiana law, which his supporters say is likely to close all five abortion clinics in the state.
According to the measure, which was signed into law by Louisiana Governor Bobby Ginald in June and was due to enter into force on September 1, doctors who perform abortions would be required to have the authority to admit patients to a hospital within a 30-mile radius of their practice.
However, the judge’s decision means that for the time being, doctors can continue to make legal abortions while continuing to seek such powers.
“The plaintiffs will be allowed to work legally, continuing to exercise their powers,” Judge John deGrevells wrote in his ruling.
The hearing will be appointed within a month in which the judge will make a more permanent decision under this law.
Advocates of the right to abortion welcomed this decision, the latest in a series of decisions against similar measures, saying it would give doctors more time to obtain hospital credentials.
“Today’s decision ensures that Louisiana women will be protected from a treacherous law that seeks to deprive them of their health and rights,” said Nancy Northap, president and head of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which filed a lawsuit to stop the law from three of the state’s five clinics.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision applied to doctors from the two clinics who had not been the plaintiffs in the case, and also filed an application for admission authority.
Louisiana is among the 11 states that have passed such laws, and the courts recently recognized such measures as unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key parts of the Texas law, which would have shut down most of the remaining clinics in the state, were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Fighters for the right to an abortion, along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, say that laws on admission powers impose restrictions on doctors that are not medically necessary.
Opponents of abortions object that such measures are aimed at protecting women's health, although some have also noted their positive effect in closing clinics.
Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has the authority to be admitted to a hospital, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.
If all other doctors in the state were forced to stop performing this procedure, this doctor, fearing for his safety, would stop performing this procedure, the group said.
Criticizing the decision, Louisiana officials said they would not punish doctors who perform abortions until their applications for admissions authority await a decision.
What will lead to the introduction of quotas for domestic products
At least half of the products for each type of goods in the assortment of trade networks should be of Russian production, says the deputy of the State Duma from the faction "Fair Russia" Oleg Nilov.
The parliamentarian has prepared a bill aimed at introducing protective measures against domestic producers, writes the newspaper "Izvestia".
The document will still be detailed in order to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
This applies to goods that are not produced in Russia. <0x3C>...> According to the rest of the product groups that are produced in Russia, the retailer will have to provide at least half of its shelves to domestic manufacturers," - Nilov told the publication.
Together with the amendments to the article "On the basics of state regulation of commercial activity in the Russian Federation", the bill provides for the introduction of amendments to the Tax Code, establishing a reduced rate of VAT of 10% on the sale of products produced in Russia.
The idea of introducing a 50% quota in trade networks is part of the package of incentives for Russian manufacturers.
At the counters will appear several times more domestic goods.
However, the initiative can have both a positive and a negative effect, experts say.
According to Sergei Litvinenko, a lawyer at Taxovik, a member of the independent expert center of the Public Duma, for the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect will be positive and will lead to growth.
In addition, there will be agricultural producers, farmers, small shops.
They will be able to sell more, which means that the profit will grow.
In addition, they will have the right to dictate to retailers their terms and prices, because they will be forced to buy their goods.
Russian producers will be able to increase their activity and sales, which will lead to the payment of higher taxes than before.
This will increase budget revenues, create new jobs, some industries will begin to expand, some will be faster to master, and contribute to GDP growth.
Russia’s dependence on foreign food will decrease several times, but not immediately,” the expert notes.
Previously, Russian companies often could not break into the counters of local stores due to high competition from foreign counterparts.
Now, after the introduction of the embargo, this niche has been liberated and can be sighed with relief.
But it should not be forgotten that after all the necessary agreements and sanitary checks, food products from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia will enter the Russian market.
In other words, now is the "moment of silence" when the previous players have already left, and the new ones have not yet arrived.
Almost a month later, we can talk about the increased demand for domestic raw materials, as well as the increase in prices for finished products," said the first Vice-President of the All-Russian public organization "Russian Club of Financial Directors", c.e. Tamara Kasyanova.
Clearly, the idea of selling at least 50% of Russian food products in each category will help to consolidate the sector for local producers.
In this case, they will compete with each other, and not with goods that, at the expense of subsidies from another state, are cheaper.
In other words, the fight for the buyer will unfold between companies working according to the uniform laws of the industry.
On the other hand, according to Kasyanova, Russian producers are able to meet 50% of the domestic needs of compatriots by far not in all articles.
And in this situation, the trade networks will have to "reach" the share of Russian goods to half of the range.
In this regard, there are growing fears that low-quality goods will come to the counters.
Possibly, under the guise of produced in Russia, foreign products with broken labels will be delivered," the expert adds.
The negative effect of quotas will be felt by large trade networks, especially those that are more profitable to cooperate with importers.
It is logical that with such a schedule, foreign suppliers themselves will suffer, as the demand for their products will decrease.
Litvinenko does not rule out that the law on quotas for domestic goods can also affect consumers.
The fact is that some products of Russian production may be inferior in quality to imported analogues, while stores will be able to wind up prices on the second, as on a scarce commodity.
The idea of import substitution, which was forgotten in the early 2000s, economists spoke again in February of this year because of the continuing devaluation of the ruble.
Now, against the background of difficult relations with the West, the issue of abandoning imported products is becoming even more relevant.
The law is intended to oblige retailers in the formation of orders suppliers to deal with domestic manufacturers.
Then we will go much faster and more confidently on the path of import substitution, and a system of production planning for the necessary types of products will be created in a shorter time," says Deputy Oleg Nilov.
A particularly effective quota mechanism would be for those agricultural sectors where the potential is particularly high, for example in the dairy sector where the share of imports was 25%.
Our farmers are really able to completely cover the counters of Russian shops.
In addition, a powerful impulse can also be given to meat production.
As you know, the largest share of imports is for beef - from 30% to 35%.
It turns out that 65-70% still belongs to Russian products," Kasyanova says.
Experts are of the opinion that the introduction of quotas for domestic products will facilitate import substitution and can accelerate this process.
However, in itself, this initiative will not lead to import substitution, as this requires a complex of measures, Litvinenko is sure.
In any case, 50% of the goods sold under this initiative can still be brought from abroad, which means that a full import substitution will not occur, but significant steps in this direction will be taken.
In addition, there is little to establish quotas, it is still necessary to establish the production of domestic products in the country in order to meet these quotas.
These quotas are just such guarantees and will provide," the expert notes.
Early diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment mean that ovarian cancer in rural areas kills more.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James released a video commemorating their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women pardoning in rural Australia face a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
The researchers analyzed the disease maps of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with "ovarian cancer" in 2005, finding that only 35 percent lived five years after being diagnosed.
Lead researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Institute of Medical Research reported that the likelihood of dying during the study was 20 percent higher in those living in regions and remote areas of the state than in those living in urban areas.
FAR MORE INVESTIGATION: New drugs may slow down lung cancer and ovarian cancer
The researchers tracked the medical path of women for seven years.
Dr. Jordan said the woman’s age at the time of diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, the presence of current diseases, and socioeconomic status also affected the likelihood of survival.
Older women and those who had cancer at a later stage at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
For those who lived in regions or remote areas of the state, the likelihood of dying during the study was 20 percent higher than for those who lived in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside of cities are more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that early diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment are possible factors.
“This disease is best treated by surgeons specializing in gynecological oncology, and they are mainly located in large cities,” she said.
Despite improving the quality of telemedicine services to reduce the impact of distance, she suggested that increasing the number of outgoing services that will allow specialists to treat women closer to home and support programs for people undergoing treatment far from home could help.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of geographical location, the study found that longevity among women with ovarian cancer was rare, emphasizing the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer, will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother from the Gold Coast, Elishe Nive, was told she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
In September, a new FAP will open its doors in the Kuzhenersky district
Construction of a medical facility in the village of Toktaibeljak was started in April of this year and was carried out on a typical project.
The cost of the work was just over 10 million rubles.
According to the Head of Public Relations and Information, the financing of the construction of the facility was carried out at the expense of the republican budget in accordance with the targeted investment program.
The total area of the built medical and preventive institution is almost 230 square meters.
There will be provided medical care to the inhabitants of eight settlements: the villages of Toktaibelyak and the villages of Dementievo, Puncheryumal, Tunia, Fomichi, Toraibelyak, Shinur and Chaskayal.
The new fielder-obstetrics point will replace the current FAP, the building of which was built in 1918 and has long exhausted its resource, and its premises do not meet sanitary and hygienic requirements.
The new facility will be opened soon.
Murder of four-month-old son in a drunken state of a new boxer will appear in court
A resident of Chuvashia will be on the bench of the defendants for the murder of her own child.
In Cheboksary, a criminal case has been completed against a 31-year-old resident of Novoceboksarsk, accused of causing death by negligence.
The investigation found that on July 26 of this year, the accused along with her four-month-old son came to celebrate the birthday of the child of her cousin in Cheboksary.
After a long meal, the new boxer decided to stay at the hotel and put the child to sleep.
When the baby woke up and cried at night, the drunken woman put him next to her on the bed to breastfeed, but soon fell asleep.
During sleep, the woman attacked her son, as a result of which he died of suffocation.
A criminal case, reports the press service of the SU SCR on Chuvashia, is sent to the court.
Inflation has gone off vacation.
Will the Russians feel a sharp increase in prices?
As a result of cross-sanctions of the Russian Federation and the West, inflation in Russia will accelerate and will not fit in with the forecasts of the authorities, analysts of VTB Capital are convinced.
According to experts, the postponed consequences of anti-sanctions will lead to an inflationary shock in the first quarter of 2015, writes RBC Daily.
According to the latest forecast of the Ministry of Economic Development, in 2014 inflation will be 6.5-7.5%, next year and even less - 6.5%.
However, according to the Kommersant newspaper, this week the mayor should make "small but fundamental" adjustments to the macroeconomic forecast until 2017.
According to the publication, the agency can lower the estimate of inflation for 2015, which will eliminate the expected zero growth of the population income.
In the forecast, it was assumed that the food sanctions of the Russian Federation are valid for a year - until August 2015.
How could such a high inflation be expected in such a situation?
The current situation implies a one-off shock, but the declining trend of inflation will not change," a source told the Ministry of Finance.
Economists from VTB Capital do not share the expectations of the government’s financial and economic bloc regarding inflation and predict price growth in 2014 at 8%.
The main effect of the food bans will come along with the possible introduction in the regions of the Russian Federation of sales tax (SAT) in 2015, experts are convinced.
Inflation will peak at 9% in February, after which the annual rate of price growth will go down, experts believe.
By the way, last week Rosstat succumbed to the first inflationary results after the Russian Federation imposed "accurate sanctions".
AiF.ru interviewed the experts and found out their inflation expectations.
Artem Deev, head of the analytical department of FC AForex:
Price increases are already observed in the main segments of goods.
Moreover, when socially significant products began to be valued, the government was forced to launch systemic price stability monitoring measures to prevent the risks of unreasonable price increases in the short term.
Suppliers and retailers are already reporting on a daily basis to regulators so that authorities know exactly who, when and for what reason is initiating price increases.
The key factors of the growth of the consumer price index continue to be the colossal rate of capital outflow, excessive refinancing of the banking sector by the Russian megaregulator, internal conversion due to the flight of the population into foreign currency, as well as the embargo on the import of food products from the country.
If inflationary pressures were kept under control, the cost of a basket of the minimum set of products would not jump by 12% in a single quarter.
The ban on the import of foodstuffs provoked a shock of supply in the domestic market and led to a perfectly logical increase in the final value.
Since at the current stage we are not able to fully launch the import substitution mechanism, as well as to increase the self-sufficiency of the Russian market due to domestic production, the retaliatory sanctions will continue to carry the risks of the growth of the inflation component.
If you add to this the fiscal reasons related to the lack of confidence in the national currency, as well as the worsening prospects for economic growth, inflation may well exceed 8% by the end of this year.
Alexander Razuvaev, Director of the analytical department "Alpari"
In the 1990s, inflation sometimes reached 20-30% per month, at zero it was also above the current level, another thing that was then compensated for by rapid economic growth.
By the end of the year, inflation will be 8-8.5%.
Plato Magouta, asset manager of the Magouta Foundation
The external factor related to sanctions against Russia is still successfully restrained, but if there is a further increase in pressure, especially on the financial sector, it can lead to certain difficulties and increase inflation expectations of the population, which are usually manifested in purchases of cash in order to secure their savings.
It can be assumed that the government, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation and the Ministry of Finance will try to mitigate the smooth weakening of the ruble, both by market methods and by state regulation.
But price increases traditionally begin after the summer slump and may become more noticeable this fall.
The target level of consumer inflation in Russia at 7.5% is likely to stand, as the Russian Federation still has financial savings.
Gardening centers are saddened by the decrease in the number of homeowners
Such a fall, due to an exceptional reduction in the number of homeowners under the age of 35, could result in garden centers starting to lose tens of millions of pounds a year when today’s young consumers reach “the mainstream age of gardening,” according to an HTA study reported by the Financial Times.
According to this report, people renting homes spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that homeowners spend on gardening.
It mentions the increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popularity of asphalting yards in front of a parking lot, and the reduction in garden size as other factors that pose a threat to the industry, whose annual sales are estimated to be <0xC2><0xA3>5 billion.
In Greater London, where the number of homeowners fell from 61 percent to 43 percent in six years, the UK’s lowest level of spending on household gardeners’ goods.
HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society reported that renting housing and lack of garden space does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief horticultural adviser at RHS, said, “Plant harvesting in containers, for example, is especially popular with tenants who can carry plants with them when moving.”
The HTA report defined the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of retail trade in horticultural goods as a result of an increase in the number of homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year due to better weather after unfavorable conditions in March and April last year.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria carried out a mass clean-up in the fund "Agriculture"
Three of the four heads of the Agriculture Fund were replaced on Friday.
In total, three of the four heads of the Agriculture Fund were replaced on Friday.
Officially, the Bulgarian Ministry of Agriculture has only announced the dismissal of the Executive Director of Atanas Dobrev.
His place was taken by Lausanne Vasileva.
It turned out that on Friday, two of the three deputy executive directors of the fund were quietly replaced.
Deputy Executive Director Tatiana Angelova, who had previously been in charge of state aid and the SAPARD program, has been released, BGNES reports with reference to the newspaper "Trud".
I was not on the Board of Trustees because we were not members of the Board of Trustees by law, but I was later informed that I had been released.
I cannot say why my dismissal is not reported on the fund’s website.
I'm on vacation.
I hope to find out more on Monday," she told Angelova.
It will be replaced by Ivanka Bagdatova, who was until now the head of “Investment lending” in the central fund in “Land” in Sofia.
Deputy Executive Director Nikolay Dachev was also released.
Until then, he was responsible for direct subsidies for fields paid by the EU.
Zhivko Zhivkov will be appointed in his place, who was the head of the regional directorate of the Zemledzie Fund in Veliko-Tyrnovo until January 2014.
Only the deputy head of the Atije Aliyeva-Veli Foundation retained his post.
It is currently responsible for the Rural Development Programme.
The official reasons for all changes in the department are not mentioned.
Turkey Calls for U.S. Diplomat Over Espionage Report
Turkey’s Foreign Ministry has summoned the country’s highest-ranking U.S. diplomat for clarification on a report on U.S. and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said a U.S. affairs official and Turkish officials discussed the message on Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel and online magazine The Intercept reported that documents provided by former U.S. National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden show that Turkey was a priority reconnaissance facility for U.S. and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has downplayed the importance of this message, saying that all the leading countries are spying on each other.
Previously reported information that Germany’s top intelligence agency also made Ankara an object of intelligence has elicited a more angry response from the Turkish government.
China's biggest companies join forces against Alibaba
Chinese companies, including China’s largest commercial real estate developer Dalian Wanda Group and internet giants Tencent Holdings (social networks, messenger, etc.) and Baidu (China’s largest search engine), are setting up a company that will compete in the online trading market with Alibaba.
However, catching up with the miracle of the Chinese Internet, which has left behind even its American rivals - eBay and Amazon.com, will not be easy.
the Union of the Greatest
The companies plan to invest 5 billion yuan ($814 million) in the joint venture, 70% of which will be owned by Wanda and 15% by each of the internet companies, the Wanda Group said in a statement.
The company is scheduled to register in Hong Kong.
SP will combine Baidu’s search services with the popular social platform WeChat (China’s largest social network, which has about 438 million users), Tencent and Wanda’s infrastructure.
In addition to a network of 40 luxury hotels, Wanda Group operates at least 49 commercial properties across China and 40 shopping malls.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion yuan (over $8 billion) in the construction of a film studio and theme park in Qingdao (a city in eastern China on the shores of the Yellow Sea).
The project is expected to attract more than 1 million visitors annually and generate a profit of $960 million.
In addition, Wanda owns the American network of cinemas AMC Entertainment Holdings, which makes the company the largest cinema operator in the world.
By 2015, Wanda plans to equip all its shopping malls, hotels and entertainment venues with e-commerce services, which will be developed by the newly created rival Alibaba.
According to Dong Tse, who will lead the new company, Wanda will be able to increase the number of users of its e-commerce services from the current 40 million people to 100 million by next year.
The new platform is set to become the world’s largest online-to-offline platform, notes Dong Tse.
The essence of online-to-offline (O2O) commerce is to attract buyers online so that they come to regular offline stores or buy other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O is the sale of coupons such as Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
“O2O is the biggest ‘cake’ in online commerce,” said CEO Wanda Wang Jianglin (a quote from Bloomberg).
“There is currently no real O2O site in China, and in this situation the chances for everyone are roughly equal,” he said.
China’s e-commerce market is the world’s largest and, according to McKinsey & Co., its volume will more than triple by 2015 compared to 2011, to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese Internet users has risen to 632 million, according to Bloomberg official statistics: this is more than the population of any country in the world except India.
And by 2015, this number is projected to grow to 850 million people.
Union of the Richest
The head of Tencent Ma Huaten until recently was China’s richest man, however, according to the Bloomberg Millionaires Index, Alibaba founder Jack Ma has already surpassed him by $5.5 billion.
Jack Ma’s fortune is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion is his share of Alibaba.
Baidu leader Robin Lee now ranks third among China’s richest people, while Wanda’s Wang Jianglin ranks fourth.
"It's very interesting to watch this battle: the three richest people are joining forces to challenge the even richer," said Bloomberg, director of China's e-commerce research center in Hangzhou, Cao Lei.
But he believes that the new company is unlikely to be able to seriously compete with Alibaba immediately after its creation: "Rome can't be built in one day."
The fact that Alibaba is not just to compete not only with new companies, but also the well-deserved leaders of the world's e-commerce, evidenced by the report on the financial performance of Alibaba for the last quarter.
Alibaba is often described as the middle ground between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June, the Chinese company earned more than both of its U.S. competitors combined.
Alibaba’s net profit for the period is almost twice the same total of competitors – it grew almost three times year-on-year and amounted to $1.99 billion.
“Alibaba still has huge potential for generating money, largely thanks to its mobile applications,” said Bloomberg, an analyst with the Arete Research Service in Hong Kong.
According to Alibaba’s updated prospectus on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission website, the number of active mobile users of the company’s services in July amounted to 188 million, significantly exceeding the March figure (163 million people).
At the same time, 32.8% of all Alibaba transactions for the past quarter had to be on mobile devices.
Alibaba has to name the value of its shares before the IPO.
According to an average estimate of 11 analysts polled by Bloomberg, the company could be valued at $187 billion after the sale of shares.
According to Bloomberg sources, Alibaba’s debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) could take place as early as September 16.
The company’s road-show, which precedes this event, will start on September 3.
Alibaba’s IPO is expected to be a record in NYSE history and will allow the company to raise about $20 billion.
So far, the record for the amount of funds raised on the US exchanges belonged to the Visa payment system, which in 2008 made the initial placement of its shares, earning $ 17.9 billion.
At least half of the food products in the trade networks should be Russian-made, state Duma deputies say.
They drafted a bill on the subject.
We are talking about amendments to Article 8 of the Federal Tax Code "About the basics of state regulation of commercial activity in the Russian Federation" and to the Tax Code.
The aim of the document is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
An important clarification, according to the bill, at least 50 percent of domestic products in stores should be for each type of product.
However, the document will take into account that there are goods that are not produced in Russia, such as vegetables and fruits in winter, so they will be made "discount" to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
At the same time, the draft law introduces an amendment to the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, which establishes a reduced rate of VAT of 10% on the sale of all food products, the country of origin of which is Russia, the newspaper Izvestia reports.
On August 27, the lower house of parliament introduced a draft law on amendments to the FZ "On Retail Markets", which proposes to revive farm markets in Russia, where small producers will be able to sell their products.
Magaluf Police Chief Accused of Corruption
The plaintiffs presented evidence of extortion by the police and officials of the municipality of Calvia to the office of the public prosecutor of Mallorca on Friday.
The head of the Calvia police on the resort island of Mallorca has been arrested following allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in the scandalous center of unrestrained drinking Magaluf.
Chief inspector Jose Antonio Navarro has been placed in custody as a result of corruption charges brought against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, a street on which most of the bars and nightclubs of Magaluf are located.
According to the daily online Mallorca Diario, the plaintiffs presented evidence of extortion by the police and officials of the municipality of Calvia to the office of the prosecutor of Mallorca on the fight against corruption on Friday.
Two more local police officers have been arrested by the Spanish National Guard on corruption charges and will be interrogated by the judge along with Navarro.
The Spanish daily ABC reported that dissatisfied nightclub owners say protectionism by the authorities has a serious impact on the state of their business.
“It’s not about making money anymore, it’s about surviving,” one businessman told the court.
We must not jeopardize our livelihoods.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made headlines in the international press this summer after a popular YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British vacationer doing blowjobs to 24 men during a bar race.
The island’s authorities have since tried to stop drunken hooliganism among Magaluf’s holidaymakers, minimizing the number of scandalously famous alcohol races at bars.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where the incident occurred, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the organizers of the Carnage Bar Race together were fined <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, mainly popular with young British holidaymakers, has also been the site of numerous alcohol intoxication accidents associated with insane entertainment known as "balconing" when people jump from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
The first day of spring is marked by wet and windy conditions that affected flights at Adelaide Airport
SPRING prepared a cold surprise in southern Australia, bringing heavy rains and strong winds that affected flights at Adelaide Airport.
Another 5 mm of rain fell on the city in the evening at 9 pm, followed by 6.6 mm, which fell during the night on Sunday.
The last rain was preceded by a couple of short gusts of gusty wind, including a thunderstorm that began shortly before 8 p.m. and poured almost 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After winter released an early portion of spring last week, temperatures fell again on Monday to a peak of just 15.8C in the city.
The poor conditions allegedly served as one of the reasons for the delay in the landing of the Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was scheduled to land just after 7:30 p.m., but hit the wind shift zone — a sudden change in speed or wind direction at a short distance — and was forced to gain altitude.
Wind gusts reached 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at the time.
The flight data showed that the plane had to gain altitude during the second landing, and the plane eventually landed at around 8:40 p.m.
The delay of this flight caused the subsequent delay of several other flights, including Emirates flight from Dubai and Qantas flight from Sydney.
A maximum of 16C is forecast in Adelaide on Tuesday with a probability of one or two showers.
The calculation of the estimate of construction sites in the Russian Federation will take place in a new way
The issues of pricing, regulation of the construction industry, as well as the problems of connection to networks, the Federal Antimonopoly Service takes special control.
Under the FAS, an expert council on the development of competition in the construction sector was established.
At his meeting, the head of the FAS Department of Housing, Construction and Natural Resources Control Vadim Soloviev said that "today's calculation of the estimate of construction facilities is completely incomprehensible".
The regulatory base makes pricing opaque and can lead to an unreasonable price of construction, according to the FAS.
And offer the cost of construction of state-owned objects at the design stage to determine on the basis of market prices of constructive solutions instead of today's estimated norms and single prices for technological operations.
These proposals are included in the "road map" and are now under consideration in Minsk.
"The replacement of traditional estimated documentation in construction with calculations of structural elements should lead to less corruption in the industry," Vadim Soloviev explained.
After all, now every bolt and nut is calculated in the estimate, and it is not always possible to check everything, so sometimes in the documentation, unscrupulous construction companies can bury "wholes of the tractor".
In my opinion, I agree with FAS.
"The first developments on the transition to cost calculation on structural elements already exist: methods have been developed for calculating prices for constructive solutions, compiling estimates on these indicators," said Elena Zhukova, head of the department of urban planning and architecture of the Ministry of Interior.
The field of road construction has been selected as a pilot.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
According to the head of the construction company "Profi-invest" Anatoly Demyanko, the estimated standards have long been outdated, but another mechanism for business is not yet offered.
“As for the proposed calculations on the structural elements, in practice this is difficult to implement, since in the construction of buildings, very different technologies are often used,” he says.
It is no secret that the construction market is developing largely thanks to the government order.
According to the Chairman of the Board of the NP "Expert community of professionals of the state order" Ekaterina Lezina, today the state is the most payable customer.
Deputy Director of Engineering of the Rosatom Capital Construction Center Vladimir Malakhov drew attention to the fact that today the market is conditionally divided into companies that have access to a portfolio of contracts, and companies that have monopoly competencies and do not allow competitors to this field.
He believes that the creation of a transparent market is possible only if access to contracts is protected as much as possible from someone’s managerial influence.
At the expert council it was proposed to form a system of state order in such a way that the same contractor is not allowed to receive more than one contract for the amount of more than 1 billion rubles. or several contracts for the amount of more than 1 billion rubles.
The Ministry believes that this approach should be evaluated in terms of the impact on business, as well as the effectiveness of construction management.
As Elena Zhukova explained, in this case, it will be necessary to provide the customer with the functions of a general contractor, which will lead to an increase in the number of employees of the customer and budget costs for its maintenance.
At the same time, the specialists of the customer will have to have the knowledge to assess the quality of the works performed by the contracting organizations, as well as their safety.
Often, in such a breakdown, it will be necessary to determine who will be responsible for the safety of the object as a whole.
In addition, this approach may lead to the outflow of highly qualified participants in public procurement due to the lack of interest in obtaining a state order for part-time work and a small amount of the contract.
The deputy head of the expert and consulting center of the Procurement Institute Alexander Evstashenkov believes that now the procedure of the state order has become a business game for the attention of the contractor.
He cited the following example: "the participant when filling out the application must specify "specific indicators" without specifying the words: "or equivalent", "must be", "of", "more", "less", "analogue", "or", "type", "analog type", "can not be lower", "lower", "higher", "may", "may", "may", "may", "may", "may", "may", "may", "may", "may", "be", "may", "may", "be", "may" "be", "may" "be", "may" "be", "may" "be", "be", "may" "be", "be", "be" "some" "some" "some" "some" "some" "some" "some" "some" or "some" or "some" "some" or "some" or "some" or "some" "some" or "some" or "some" "some" "some" or "some" or "some" or "some" or "some" or "some" or "some" or "some" or "some" or "some" or "some" or "some" or "some" or "some" or "some" or "some" or "some" or "some" or "some" "some" or "some" or "some" "some" "some" or "some" or "some" "some" or "some" or "some" or "some" "some" or "some" "some" "some" or "some" "some" or "some" or "some" or "some" or "some" or "some" or "or "may" or "some" or "some" or "some" or "may" or "may" or "may" or "some" or "some" "some" "some" "some" "some" or "some" "some" or "some" or "some" or "some" "some" or "some" or "some" "some" "some" or "some" "some" or "some" or "some" or "some" or "some" or "some" or "some" "some
Thus, customers often abuse their right to establish requirements for the content of the application submitted by contracting entities.
Another problem 44-FZ, in the opinion of Evstashenkov, was the need to evaluate the quality of work at the stage of submission of the application through the "paper" offer of the participant.
Considering the application of the participant, it is possible to evaluate only the qualification of the contractor, but not the quality of the work, which has not even begun to be carried out, - believes the expert.
The quality of the work can only be assessed upon its acceptance.
At the expert council, it was also proposed to move the marginal income from the top to the bottom level in order to eliminate intermediate contractors.
Chairman of the expert council, state secretary, deputy head of FAS Andrey Tsarikovski believes that this should not be done, since the general contractor should be responsible for the order.
And otherwise it will turn out, as in the famous reprise of Arkady Raikin's "Atelier": "Is there a claim to the buttons?".
Israeli Children Return to School After Gaza War <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Thousands of Israeli children in areas near the Gaza Strip went back to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters, when rockets and rain mines fell on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip remained closed.
The beginning of schooling brought a sense of joy and excitement to the rocket-stricken settlements of southern Israel, but the traces of hostilities remained fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the kindergarten "Pashos", in which the rocket fell, removed traces of fragments from the walls and children's climbs before the arrival of students.
“We’re a little scared, but we’re looking forward to the future,” said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher at his school.
Many children in our area really need to return to a measured life.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said that suddenly starting school again was "a little weird."
“It was a difficult time and we didn’t leave our homes at all,” she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the kibbutz, which is located near the border with Gaza, to express his support.
Before a cease-fire agreement halted the war last week, thousands of residents of border settlements such as Saad did not take to the streets or leave their homes, leaving for safer areas beyond the Gaza Strip to escape a rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a settlement near the Gaza border where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a fragment of a Palestinian mine, doubt that they should go back.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families have not yet returned.
Their children were sent to other schools at this time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the border with Gaza, which was heavily damaged by the Palestinian fire.
He advised the children to study diligently and said, “We will do our best to give you knowledge and ensure your safety.”
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite truce last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately put an end to hostilities, but key issues remained unresolved, such as Hamas' demand for the lifting of the Egyptian-Israeli blockade of Gaza and the opening of airports and seaports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to lay down its weapons and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
A new phase of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
The war killed more than 2,100 Palestinians, three-quarters of whom were civilians, and at least 494 children, according to estimates by the Palestinian side and the UN.
Israel disputes these figures and claims that at least half of those killed were militants; despite this, it has not provided substantive evidence to support this claim.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including one Thai worker.
During the fighting, Hamas and other Gaza militants fired 4,591 missiles and mines into Israeli cities, mostly in the south of the country.
The Israeli army, meanwhile, carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
Thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip have been damaged and destroyed as a result of Israeli attacks, and an estimated 250,000 people have found refuge in more than 100 schools that have been converted into shelters.
Due to the fact that tens of thousands of people were still in shelters and the fighting continued, officials in charge of education last week postponed the start of the school year.
“I hope the school will open soon so that we can complete our education as children all over the world and as Jewish children,” said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who now lives in one of Gaza’s schools.
According to the popular criterion, real estate prices showed the biggest winter growth in seven years.
The housing price index RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic for housing prices in the Australian capital rose by 1.1 percent in August, RP data reported on Monday.
This increase led to an overall increase of 4.2 per cent in June, July and August, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, more than double the 12-month growth by August 2013, but the increase was not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data’s research director Tim Lowless said Sydney and Melbourne have a two-tier market.
RP Data figures show that in Sydney, housing prices have risen by 16.1 percent over the past year, while in Melbourne, housing prices have risen by 11.7 percent.
The next most powerful markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices on average rose from five to six percent.
At the other end of the scale was Canberra, which was followed by government spending cuts, where prices rose by just 1.4 per cent per year.
Mr. Lowless said that now that spring has begun, there will be an increase in the number of properties put up for sale over the next few months, which will be a "real test" for the market.
“Given the current high rate of auction sales, the overall high rate of sale and the current low interest rate conditions, it is likely that the cost of housing will still rise in the next three months,” he said.
How do people live in Ufa’s oldest house?
In the former house of gold miners and miners Evdokim and his son Ivan Demidov on the street of October Revolution 57/1 (formerly Great Kazan) 18 apartments.
The house of the eighteenth century has practically not changed since the time of construction, except for old age.
Foreign people come here as for a tour, and residents suffer more than they rejoice, from their privilege - the right to live in the oldest Ufim house, the walls of which remember the commander Alexander Suvorov.
The date of construction of the house is inaccurate, historians indicate two dates - 1730 and 1737.
But in any case, it turns out that the building without a small 300 years.
The old courtyard, always an open door, a squeaking staircase.
The doors to the apartments are located close to each other, the walls cracked, and in the luminaries from the plaster plaster can be seen in places.
I think it's all up to the word.
And the locals say, "You don't think so."
Living in a wooden house of the XVIII century is very difficult, - says Tatyana Lukyanova, resident of apartment No 3.
The object is in state custody, but the money for its maintenance has not been allocated for decades, and we feel like museum exhibits, which the authorities have simply forgotten.
The last repair was 40 years ago.
The walls are still poorly maintained, but the foundation has rotted.
Many residents still go to the toilet on the street, and wash once a week in a public bath.
How can we be happy in such conditions?
The road runs right under the windows, not even a pedestrian zone.
Tatiana's moving the curtain.
Now you can see what was only heard before: there is a flow of cars under the windows.
You see, the glass is moving constantly, we can't open the windows, and we're used to the noise.
Man is accustomed to everything, to good and bad.
Our apartment is still exemplary, thanks to the husband, his hands are golden.
Plus, we have two rooms, we live in three with a son.
And in other families the conditions are much worse, on the second floor in general ceilings a little more than one and a half meters high.
In contrast, Tatiana offers to visit her neighbor from the apartment No. 6 Lyudmila Starostina.
A pleasant hospitable woman from the doorstep offers a cup of coffee and with a sad smile says:
We have a one-bedroom apartment, 14.5 m2 for four people, and we live: we are with my husband and daughter with a granddaughter.
I have been here since birth, there has never been another residential area, - Lyudmila looks around the room: the entresols, two sofas with the letter "g"; on one of them there was a granddaughter with a laptop.
Very narrow and little different from the usual domestic interior: only the ceilings are beautiful, "historic".
But from the ceiling flows regularly: the water system is not suitable anywhere.
Lyudmila speaks of her apartment as ordinary and surprisingly at the same time, as an Italian woman whose house stands on Roman ruins.
That is, it boils down to one very old and recent, everyday and legendary:
The pipeline was completed about 40 years ago during the last repair.
Then they made us a small kitchen in the corner and a toilet made of a former chilan.
We live exactly where Demidov and his family lived, and servants lived on the second floor.
Our apartment is not privatized, and why?
At the Ufa Real Estate Center, it is said that privatization is of no importance.
We will still get only one-bedroom apartment, we can not claim for more.
Four months ago we were promised to resettle, but no further promises were made.
I'm not used to complaining and I won't.
In this apartment (room!) lived a whole dynasty: my grandmother with grandfather, mother with father, me with husband and my daughter with granddaughter.
Everything happened during this time.
For example, large rats ran around the kitchen.
Look at the walls of the wing, they are meters thick!
It is said that the solution was mixed on the eggs, so it lasts for so long.
The house is well built, thank you Demidov!
Probably that's why no one's been killed by a collapsed ceiling or his own.
Only the building still slowly dies before our eyes: the boards and logs of the houses rot, the floors repeatedly failed, we poured cement, but everything is useless - the solution goes into the ground, like into a well.
They say it is, under our room a secret abyss and a walk to the White River, which was specially made by the old men who once lived here, so that we could hide from the danger, in case of what.
They were being chased.
Lyudmila Starostina tells how some historian came to them, begged to let him start the excavation in the apartment.
And then persuaded them to give them a plot of land in exchange for their granddaughter on October Avenue.
Lyudmila the historian refused:
Where are we four in a row?
And here there is even a tiny hope that they will give the housing more spacious.
If we agreed to trade, we wouldn't have won anything.
But the old man’s family didn’t win.
Lyudmila's biggest dream was to move them, and her daughter and 16-year-old granddaughter were given a separate room.
That is, two families have allocated a two-room apartment instead of the most majestic ruins, in which two generations now live.
Cute, miniature girl Olesya Karsakov from apartments No. 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.
There, in two narrow rooms with a total area of 23 m2, called apartments, lives her large family.
There are seven of us, two children.
You can see for yourself what the conditions are.
The plaster is discarded in pieces, like window frames, in the walls of the kitchen and in the rooms through holes.
The water in the tap is cold all year round.
Walking through the apartments of the oldest house of Ufa, we can make sure that the most fortunate spouses Lavrentiev from apartment No. 4.
They occupy the most spacious rooms on the first floor.
You're right, there's plenty of room!
The room is 75 squares, prescribed three people.
We live in the very rooms where, according to legend, Suvorov stayed during his stay in Ufa, - says the head of the family Alexander Dmitrievich Lavrentiev.
The ceilings are high, spacious.
One bad thing - everything around the seams cracks, collapses, collapses.
Neighbors have already told me!
Most of the torture we have with the floors: the wooden boards rotted, the earth literally went away from under our feet.
I put the supports, the wedges; in the hall there is nothing else, and in the other room we walk, as we swing on swings, so much the mess.
About the house of merchant Evdokim Demidov Alexander Dmitrievich can tell better than any guide.
The goldsmith is treated as a native, speaks of him with admiration.
Indeed, the personality was extraordinary: the owner of the Kagin and Uzyan factories built houses, cast cannons and bells, held Ural mines.
The heirs of the commercial property are proud of the ancestor, but no longer want to live under the same roof with history.
I settled here as a child, in the 40-ies of the 20th century, - says Alexander Dmitrievich.
Then there were wooden rooms for carriages, stables and guardhouses, which were later demolished.
In 1968, they wanted to remove our house, but something stopped...
The story was repeated in 2014: again lured by new housing.
We, as a team, collected all the documents, ran the necessary instances, and suddenly learned that the move to the apartments is postponed to 2015 or 2016.
I don’t believe in all this anymore...
Two years ago, Lavrentyev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan to learn about the fate of the house.
Residents were not accepted.
They were sent from one table to another, and then, as a mockery, issued a piece of paper without a signature and stamp: "The Ministry of Culture does not object to the resettlement of residents."
I even had the feeling that our house was not in the city plan for a long time, because at first it was under the number 57, then became 57 A, and now 57/1.
It's like it was taken down in the '70s.
"Russian Planet" appealed to the leading sector of information and analytical work of the Department of Land Resources of Ufa Vladimir Barabas.
The house on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 is included in the program of resettlement of old housing.
I cannot be responsible for the actions of the officials of the 70s, I only know that at that time there was a plan to demolish all the old houses, despite the historical significance.
Fortunately, this did not happen, and the decision of the modern authorities - to restore all the old houses on the street of the October Revolution, representing architectural value - is successfully carried out.
Residents are expected to move into new apartments soon.
According to Barabas, the restoration of the Demidov House will be carried out by Italian specialists who participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice.
Now in Italy is held an architectural biennale, and the project "Old Ufa" is presented there among others.
I hope that by 2016 the entire former Old Kazan Street will be restored, - says the official.
The houses will acquire an appropriate appearance, corresponding to the one that was before, three centuries ago.
The Demidov House is likely to become a museum open to all.
In addition, at the government level, it was decided to make the street on weekends pedestrian.
On weekdays, unfortunately, it will not work, too much traffic in the city.
To displace people from the future museum Vladimir Barabash promises in 2015.
However, it is unlikely that they will be satisfied: their new apartments will be the same area as the current ones.
Only from a different era.
In Primorye, due to the storm, a forest fire began
The dry storm caused a forest fire on the territory of the Hunting Area Forestry in the Pozharsky District of the Primorsky Territory.
At the site of the fire, a grouping of forces and funds is being built up.
According to the management of KGSBU "Primorskaya Air Base", the conditions created at the site of the fire require the attraction of aviation forces.
Vasily Medvedev, Deputy Chief of the Air Base:
The fire, which occurred in a hard-to-reach area, was detected by an observer pilot on board an An-2 patrol aircraft on an area of 3 hectares.
Burning wood residue on the old burner.
The strong congestion of the territory and the steepness of the slope of more than 45 degrees, the lack of suitable landing paratroopers-fireplaces create significant difficulties in extinguishing.
We need a Mi-8 helicopter.
The supply of forces at the disposal of the airbase by Mi-2 helicopter and An-2 aircraft is very difficult.
After the fire was detected, four parachutists and firefighters were quickly planted at the site of the extinguishing.
The main task of specialists is to extinguish the fire and prepare the site for the delivery of additional firefighting forces and means.
In the lunch area in the area of the village Hunting helicopter additional 3 paratroopers were delivered.
As soon as the site for landing the helicopter in the area of the fire is ready, specialists will be transferred to the place of extinguishing, it is reported on the website of the administration of the Primorsky region.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
I never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of seven children born into a family of immigrants from Jamaica to Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked at the factory, and their relationship was limited.
Henry reprises the comedy, "Rare Records of Rudy", which is partly based on imaginary conversations with his father and grew out of a series of shows on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, and the melodies are lively.
However, Henry had to get through some difficult childhood memories.
After his mother's death there was "a lot" of treatment, in addition, Henry often ponders his relationship with his father.
He was very inaccessible.
You've never seen his face, you've only heard his voice: "Stop the noise.
Stay away from your sister.
Move! Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were adults when I was a kid, went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of a beer glass, the beauty of hitting cricket.
I've never talked to him like that.
He was such a grinning guy in the corner who read the paper most of my life.
Henry recently opened a foundry in Dudley and, although the conditions were better than in his father’s days, he was able to look at what his life must have been like.
Now there's a little better, but it's dark, smoky, deep labyrinths of hell with flashes of fire and smoke and a bunch of soot.
My dad went into the bathroom and just lay there, and you heard him slowly start singing about himself because he wanted to wash off the foundry.
When I got there, I realized that he had been doing this for years and years to earn us food, and I began to appreciate him more.
However, Henry came out of childhood devoid of parental love.
My father never hugged, never said, "I love you."
It wasn’t until my mom got sick at the very end of her life that we started saying, “I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don French, allowed him to share the love he lacked as a child.
Can you stop that "I love you"?
Just stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Don French.
Why can't I be friends with her?
She's a great mom.
They're still great friends with French, whom he's been married to for 25 years.
Don is a good man.
Why can't I be friends with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
He was one of those who killed her.
So when I got very, very well and I had symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You need to take radical action.
Then I started serious fitness classes, and I also had to sit on a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's boring.
No one eats carrots.
Henry’s change of career trajectory is reflected, perhaps, in his noble, short-haired beard.
Ever since he received critical acclaim for his Othello, he has fully immersed himself in the theatre.
It was followed by "The Comedy of Errors" and then "The Fences" by August Wilson.
This work is different from sitcoms and comedies, which were an inseparable attribute of his rich professional life.
He started his career when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
DJ noticed him parodying on stage, and wrote about him in New Faces.
His television career began in the mid-1970s: “For quite a long time I was the only black parody/comedian on television.”
He studied at work.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, I had to learn to be an effective joke delivery machine between 1975 and 1985, being a star working on television, and it was very hard.
Lenny in "New Faces" in 1975
Since his manager had rights to the Black and White Minster Show, an easy entertainment program in which people “blackened their faces,” Henry discovered that he had been performing in it for five years.
My family didn’t like it very much.
I seem to wish it had never happened to me, but I don’t regret doing it.
Although it was a strange, condemnable position, I worked in large venues and learned to work with the crowd.
But what was "a passing award for light entertainment classic on British television for years and years" was also "a grotesque parody of black people".
Representing characters who were teased and sung about the culture of black people in Britain, Henry worked on an alternative comedy project in the 1980s.
The first season of The Lenny Henry Show aired in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known as, among other things, chef Gareth Blacklock from the comedy series Chef!
Commercials, documentaries, TV series and film roles took the next ten years of his life, but after his 2008 BBC series LennyHenry.tv, he thought, "What are you going to do next, Len, because it seems a little like you're taking time or quietly."
Then there was a series of documentaries on Radio 4 called "What's good about...?"
The first was about Shakespeare.
I had a real allergies to Shakespeare.
I can’t say I’ve been taught that much in school, and I thought it was largely the prerogative of middle-class white people with pantyhose and cabbage down the front.
So I was very afraid of him.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nann, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, said, "You have to try.
Don't curse it until you know what you're talking about.
Speak some of these words out loud, and you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 lines from Othello's last monologue for a documentary transmission, and he got caught.
I felt like I could do it.
It's like my head's been straightened.
"That's what it is, it's a serious matter, take it seriously, teach your text, do a little research.
So the rehearsal process was tough, and I read this play for months and months before we put it on.
And she was successful.
It seemed like they were waiting for a disaster, but it didn't happen.
Soon we started the Comedy of Errors.
All of a sudden I'm at the National Theatre, and I just couldn't believe it to the end.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical problem, and Henry instinctively felt that it was his job to entertain the audience.
“The quiet voice inside me said, ‘You’ll have to work 10 minutes while they’re doing the computer.’”
Instead, the assistant director announced that the performance would resume as soon as the problem was solved.
I walked off the stage and something inside me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my duty.
I can let someone else handle it.
"You play the play, stay in the role."
Henry in "Zabory" at the Dashess Theatre
Learning the text for "Blocks" was difficult.
Panic is quite useful, it strengthens the muscles.
It was also well received, so it was like a sign from above, showing, "That's what you need to do."
He said it in a loud voice, of course.
So I'm sticking to it.
I really love it.
I love being in the rehearsal room.
By the way, Henry is still thinking of the comedian - all the way our conversation is interrupted by flashes of his humor, when he begins, then ends to parody.
I just decided not to work in the stand, because this thing with instant rewards from a full room of strangers, I think, is quite dangerous.
If you are constantly striving for it, it can lead to a deadlock.
I sometimes work on Apollo Live when I want to, but mostly I don’t get the pleasure I used to.
I'm asking if he's ever going to do a stand-up tour again.
The joy of sitting in the room with a director who helps shape the beginning, the middle and the end of the journey – I don’t think I’ll ever want to give it up.
So this is his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like to be an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and this is a great place to do it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers government officials to identify ‘invisible workers’
Kenya has begun biometric registration of all government officials in an attempt to remove “invisible workers” from the government’s payroll.
Employees who do not register within the next two weeks will no longer be paid, the government said in a statement.
The government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive wages after leaving public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta has pledged to reduce corruption in state structures after coming to power in 2013.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>700,000) a month is lost due to payments to “invisible workers” and other financial misconduct.
The government suspects that wages continue to go into bank accounts even after a person dies or leaves public service, BBC reporter Vanyama Chebusiri from the capital, Nairobi, reports.
All government officials must be present at identification centres within the next two weeks to ensure that their data is collected through a biometric registration procedure, the government said in a statement.
Anyone who does not do so without a respectable reason will be deleted from the payment statement, it is reported.
"This procedure will significantly contribute to the rationalization of the public service by determining the actual number of civil servants, and will also be used to clear the payroll at both levels of government - therefore, will put an end to the problem of the structuring of the "employees-invisibles," said Enn Vaiguru, the secretary.
Dozens of Turkish Police Arrested for 'Conspiracy' Against Government
A total of 33 police officers have been detained in Turkey on suspicion of "conspiracy against the government," local news agencies said.
The police did not immediately comment on the information.
Among the detainees were 14 high-ranking officers, according to Hurriet Daily News.
Some of them last December took part in anti-corruption activities, which were aimed at verifying government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested on suspicion of forming an organized criminal group and wiretapping the phone.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was Prime Minister at the time) defined their actions as part of measures taken against him and others in power by Islamic cleric Fethullah Gülen.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Schools in most of Ukraine reopened their doors on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally a big event for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
There he told expected journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he would do everything he could to protect the country for future generations:
On September 1st, the ceremony was not held in every school.
There is no peaceful sky above every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful heaven.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge united Ukrainian people’s front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Alexan Pastukhov, the headmaster of the school in Slavyansk, to which Yatsenyuk’s daughter went, spoke Russian.
We hope that the world will finally settle here and that the children will receive the knowledge that will be useful in their future lives.
The first day of school is traditionally marked by the fact that children wear embroidered shirts, hold balloons in their hands and give flowers to their teachers.
In the face of Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found such an impressive leader that she needs
It is followed by a slew of fame from the world of banking, media management and internal circles of the Tori party.
In fact, she has her own experience in leadership positions.
Her career began at Bain and Co, a global management consulting firm, and then continued at Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI, and the media world at Pearsons.
She was the head of the Financial Times for seven years, resigning when a senior position at Pearson’s was held by a male colleague who held a lower position.
It is said that her earnings are approaching <0xC2><0xA3>1 million.
Its political rating is also strong.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Brown, the former head of BP, when he tried to bring private sector specialists to Whitehall: she became a Cabinet adviser.
Her husband is a former adviser to Tori.
Earlier in May, I called the work of the chairman of the poisoned cup.
The BBC is not only a huge and complex organization at the heart of public life, but there is an internal paradox in its structure.
The Council has two directions: inside as the top level of the BBC’s management hierarchy itself, but also outside as a voice of public concern and excitement when something goes wrong.
This is an almost unattainable duopoly that needs complete radical reform.
However, what new president would risk coming, crushing and destroying an institution as complex as the Chinese dynasty, if he were to lose himself in the process.
It's a difficult decision.
It wouldn’t have been that difficult, many people would be happy to see the BBC shrink in size – after reviewing its powers, finances and status.
As competitors narrow the circle and new technologies challenge old habits, the inevitable negotiation of the cost of the license poses a particular danger to the BBC.
For a modest sum of <0xC2><0xA3>145.50 a year, the British acquire a stake in, by far, the largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it states that the results of its work cover 96 percent of households and cost each of them only 40p a day.
What’s more, it’s obvious that Beeb’s popularity is growing: 53 percent support it today versus 31 percent 10 years ago.
The BBC’s viewing and usage patterns have changed: I now get news headlines on my mobile phone and watch missed programs on iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and impressive institution.
He needs an impressive chairman - I hope he's found him.
Perry from Texas says the humiliating tweet was written by someone else
A tweet from Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s confirmed account on Sunday night contained an insulting image of the Democrats’ district attorney, who is at the center of a criminal prosecution on charges of abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted, followed by another from Perry's account, in which the recording was disavowed.
A tweet has just been posted from my account, which was written by someone else.
“I don’t approve of this tweet and I removed it,” a later tweet said.
Perry’s assistants did not immediately respond to the messages with a request to comment.
Although the recordings were downloaded from Perry’s verified account, it was unclear who was actually publishing the tape.
An earlier tweet contained a rude cartoon of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lemberg, who was found guilty of drunk driving in April 2013.
Perry banned funding her office when she refused to resign, leading to a grand jury trial in Austin this month against Perry, who is a potential presidential candidate in the 2016 election.
“I don’t always drive a car in a state of intoxication, three times the permissible level of alcohol in the blood, but when I do, I accuse Governor Perry of telling me about it.”
I'm the most drunk Democrat in Texas.
The Lemberg Office did not conduct an investigation involving a grand jury against Perry.
They were handled by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the accusations a political ploy.
His powerful legal team asked the judge in charge of the case to dismiss the indictment, saying the law used to prosecute the governor who has the longest-serving office in Texas' history would vaguely contradict the constitution.
Perry stopped funding $7.5 million from the State Public Control Division, which is based in Travis County and is pursuing corruption in the Texas public sector when Lemberg refused to resign.
The veto triggered an official complaint from a left-wing social control group.
Perry's confirmed account tape is often updated - and sometimes becomes famous.
Coming fifth at a party convention in Iowa during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to rumors that he might quit the game by tweeting a photo of himself running near the lake and saying, "Here we are, South Carolina!"
Berkeley reports that the real estate market has returned to “normal condition”
One of London’s best-known developers has warned that the real estate market in south-east England has “returned” to a normal level of activity.
Houses in the capital have been the subject of bustling demand and rapidly rising prices, with fears that the credit bubble will push the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgage loans in June wide-spread.
Tony Pijley, founder and chairman of the elite construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: “Since the beginning of this fiscal year, the market has returned to a normal level of transactions since peaking in 2013, adding that this has provided a “stable working environment.”
The London real estate market has thrived during the recession as foreign buyers relocated to the capital.
Prices in the city jumped 18.5 percent in the past year alone, according to the Land Registry, significantly outpacing the average figure of 6.7 percent for England and Wales as a whole.
Average market prices for Berkeley’s private, affordable and student schemes rose by about one-fifth last year to reach <0xC2><0xA3>423,000 at the end of April.
However, the strengthening of the pound in recent months has made London real estate less attractive to foreign buyers, some of whom have also halted the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric around a potential "mansion tax" ahead of the general election next May.
London-based real estate agency Foxtons warned last week that April’s mortgage market reform, which introduced tighter loan terms, would also result in a decline in market growth for both real estate purchases and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a drop in the number of mortgages approved in June, suggesting further cooling in the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has slashed its forecast for 2015 to 3%, based on a weakening of the real estate price.
Transaction volumes, meanwhile, fell by a quarter compared to the previous year in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, according to WA Ellis.
However, demand for homes in the capital proved very profitable for Berkeley, raising sales above <0xC2><0xA3>2.2 billion.
Mr. Pijley added: “The demand for the right product with a good design and a better location has remained the same and, reflecting this, the sales for the term have remained.”
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes this year through the end of April - almost a third more than in the pre-crisis peak of 2007.
Annual pre-tax earnings rose by 40 per cent from the previous year to <0xC2><0xA3>380 million, income by 18 per cent to <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion.
Speaking on Monday before the company’s annual meeting, Mr. Pijley said Berkeley’s projected revenues for this year would be in line with current market expectations.
According to a unanimous opinion of analysts, profit is expected for the whole year before paying taxes of <0xC2><0xA3>450 million.
The price of Berkeley shares was kept at <0xC2><0xA3>23.96 in the afternoon on the London Stock Exchange.
Photos of naked Jennifer Lawrence published on the Internet by a hacker
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th annual award ceremony of the American Film Academy.
Photos of naked actress Jennifer Lawrence, who won an Oscar, were posted on the Internet by a hacker who claims that she has a "catalogus" of photos of another 100 rising stars.
The star of the Hunger Games confirmed that Lawrence's photos are real, and condemned the hacker for "sudden invasion of personal space".
There has been an appeal to law enforcement, and they will prosecute anyone who posts stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos, which were originally posted on the 4chan photo-sharing site, were allegedly obtained due to a lack of Apple’s iCloud online storage system, and the alleged “catalogus” of the victims of the hack includes the names of dozens of women celebrities, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth and Winnsted.
It is not clear how many of these photos are genuine, although the star of "Scott Pilgrim Against All" Winstead on Twitter also condemned the hack.
“Those who look at the photos my husband and I took a few years ago, alone at home, I hope you’re proud of yourself,” Winstead wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice of Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victoria the Winner" denied that she was in the photos, writing on Twitter: "These so-called photos of me nude FALSE, people.
Let me stop it in the embryo. *screaming intentional*.
Buzzfeed reported last Sunday that the representative of pop star Ariana Grande has denied that the photos in which she is supposed to be, are genuine.
An exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson’s new novel about love and the letter “J” that sparked praise from critics
They dissolved, best of all, they gradually collapsed, like a cardboard box left in the rain.
Only sometimes did the woman tell him that he was too serious, too difficult to communicate, too tense, too closed, and maybe a little irritable.
And then she shook his hand.
He saw the irritability in himself.
He was stabbed like a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this craving was a little romance, from which he expected more than usual, to get rid of a lonely and boring life and perhaps even some satisfaction.
Eileen Solomons was a tremblingly fragile beauty with shattered hair and a trembling heart from a northern island village even more remote and harsh than Port Roiben.
She came to the south with a companion older than herself, which Kevern considered her aunt, while the latter inherited a house in a raw, but paradise-like valley under the joyful name "Paradise Valley".
No one lived in the house for several years.
The pipes flowed, the spiders sat still in the baths, the slugs left their traces on all the windows, confident that the house belonged to them; the garden was covered with weeds resembling giant cabbage noodles.
It was like a cottage from a children's book, both scary and charming, with a secret garden.
The author's perspective: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" was included in the long-list of the Booker Prize in 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern and Eilinn sat down, holding his hands, in broken loungers among the tall grass, enjoying the unexpectedly warm spring day; they both dispersedly connected to the cheap console, which provided the country with calming music and calming news, when the slumbering.
You have too big legs.
Due to their inherent aggressiveness, songs of this type on the console were no longer lost.
They weren’t banned – nothing was actually banned – they just didn’t lose anymore.
They were helped to become archaic, like the word "archaic" itself.
The public taste did something that would never be achieved by orders and precepts, and just as among books people chose memoirs of the rich who grew up in poverty, culinary books and romance novels, out of all the music they chose ballads.
Fascinated by this day, Kevern began to play the imaginary piano and the coarse comical voice to sing Eilinn's big legs.
Eileen didn't understand.
“It was a popular song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller,” he told her, mechanically putting two fingers on her lips.
That's what his father always did to stop the letter "J" before it landed on his lips.
It all started with the game he played when he was a kid.
His father played it with his father as he told him.
Start the word with "J," forgetting to put two fingers in your mouth, and it'll cost you a penny.
It wasn’t a very fun game then, and it wasn’t very fun now.
He knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Eileen never heard him.
Jazz was not played either, although it was not openly banned.
Improvisation is out of fashion.
There is only one “if” in life.
When the melody began, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
It's exactly the same with sharps.
His unpredictability was on people's nerves.
And jazz was an acuity, expressed with the help of music.
Although he reached the age of 10 without ever hearing about Sammy Davis Jr., Kevern knew about jazz from his father's semi-secret CD collection.
But at least he didn't have to tell Eileen that Fats Waller was black.
Given her age, she hardly remembered the time when popular singers were not black.
Again, no laws or pressure.
Society was obedient, and this meant that each of its segments agreed with gratitude—gratitude for those saved by fate—with the principle of group predisposition.
People of Afro-Caribbean descent by temperament and physical characteristics were well suited for the field of entertainment and sports - and they sang and ran.
The natives of Indostan, as if by nature talented in everything related to electronics, took care that no family was left without a working electronic phone.
What was left of the Polish diaspora was involved in sanitary work; what was left of the Greek was a plate.
The natives of the Persian Gulf and the Levant, whose grandfathers did not quickly leave the country, when WHAT HAPPENED, IF THE GENERAL HAPPENED took place, in the fear that they would be accused of igniting a fire, in fear, and in the fear, they would be accused of blaming, actually, of blaming.
to each according to ability.
Since she had only heard ballads before, it was hard for Eileen to understand how the insulting words that Kevern had just sung to her could even be put to music.
Music is an expression of love.
“They’re not really offensive,” Kevern said.
Except maybe for people who have big legs.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He said too much, but the run-down garden gave him the illusion of safety.
Not a word could penetrate the soundproofing of giant cabbage-like leaves.
Eileen didn't understand.
How could your father love that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he didn’t want to put two fingers on her lips again.
She already thought he was weird.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She nodded suspiciously, closing Keverna's review.
In the whole world there was nothing but the land of her black-brown hair.
Nothing he'd like to see.
"Well, if you say so," she said, remaining with her opinion.
But that still doesn't explain why you're eating it for me.
She seemed really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked at them again.
You can't say no.
Knees, maybe a little...
And you're saying you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Do I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just that stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"I like you just because you have thick ankles," he tried to say instead.
I'm so perverted.
That sounded wrong.
He wanted it to be funny.
Attempts to joke often put him in awkward situations because, like his father, he lacked the soothing charm that could soften the cruelty of the jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted to.
In spite of his good eyes.
Eileen Solomons turned red and got up from the lounger, flipping the console and spilling the wine they drank.
Wine from a bottle, so intoxication could not serve as an excuse for him.
In her excitement she seemed to tremble like palm leaves in a hurricane.
"I like you because you have a stupid head," she said.
Even if you don't like it.
He felt sorry for her both because of the excessive rudeness of his words, and because of the fear that appeared in her eyes when she gave him resistance.
Did she think he'd hit her?
She didn’t talk to him about living in the cold northern archipelago where she grew up, but he didn’t doubt that she was basically like this one.
The same huge ocean of ice collapsed on both of them.
The same mad men, even more sensitive and capricious after what happened, if it happened in general than their ancestors, smugglers and destroyers, wandered in rage from pubs to pubs, ready to raise their hands against any woman.
Stupid head?
They'd show her a stupid fist if she wasn't careful!
The kiss would have been the most common expression of erotic annoyance between a man and a woman; the antidote to the fresh ballads that the console issued was to kiss her first and then hit her.
Excessive clarification, in Kevern's opinion, because kissing itself was already bullying.
Aileen Solomons showed the corps that he had to leave.
He got out of the bed like an old man.
She herself felt the weight of lead, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It was not the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him leave, and from the top of the window she watched him leave, her companion being a man who took on himself a burden.
Adam, leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt an injection of sympathy for him and the men in general, even though some of them raised their hand at her.
The man who turned away from her, with his back bent, embarrassed, battered, all his ability to fight left him - why did she think she knew it so well, if she could not remember a single case, until today, when she would have seen such a thing?
Once again, Eileen Solomons looked at her feet.
For twenty years before the events described above or about that Esme Nussbaum, a smart and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked in "Ofnau", an informal public mood control service, has prepared a small report on the preservation of low and medium levels of violence in the same parts of the country.
“A lot has been done, and a lot is being done,” she wrote, “to alleviate the innate aggressiveness of the people who fought in a thousand wars and won most of them, especially among these entangled branches and narrow human settlements of the area, where, despite the ripples floating over the fences of the spires of the churches, there is no good news.
However, some qualities are indelible.
The higher the spine, it would seem, the lower the passions it generates.
The population even sheds tears over sentimental ballads, swallows up stories of overcome obstacles and proclaims its fervent faith in the virtue of marriage and family life, but not only the old rudeness retains its strong hold on the new ones, in rural communities and in urban areas.
“You have an annoying habit of writing too much,” her scientific supervisor said, reading the report in its entirety.
I think you should read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask you: Are you an atheist?
“I don’t think I have to answer,” Esme Nussbaum replied.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme once again insisted on her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Silence again.
“I ask,” finally said Luther Rabinovic, “not because I am against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
We have no prejudices here.
We are servants of society without prejudice.
But some types of hypersensitivity, absolutely acceptable and commendable in themselves, can sometimes distort the results, such as those you have shown me.
It is obvious that you yourself are prejudiced against the church, and what you call “evil” and “rough” others would interpret as an expression of natural vitality and energy.
To continue to complain about what has happened, if it has happened in general, as if it had happened, if it had happened, yesterday, is to deprive the country of the life force it needs.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinovic spoke.
Behind his head, pink, flamingo-like, LED letters echoed the advice that the Offnau gave the country for the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, appreciate your spouse, listen to ballads, go to musicals, talk on the phone, communicate, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Conversation is better than silence, the word of a song is better than a written word, but there is nothing better than love.
“I fully understand what you want to say,” Esme Nussbaum quietly replied, as she made sure her scientific director had finished speaking, “and I don’t want to say anything except that we haven’t healed as effectively as we convince ourselves.
I am concerned that if we are not ready, we will find that we are repeating the mistakes that initially led to WHAT HAPPENED, IF IT HAPPENED TOTALLY.
Only this time will we throw our anger and distrust at others.
Luther Rabinovic connected the tips of his fingers into a pyramid.
This gesture was meant to mean infinite patience.
“You go too far,” he said, “by calling it “mistakes” of actions that our grandparents made or did not make.
You go too far and when you talk about that they threw their “anger” and “mistrust” on “others.”
In your place, a person should not need to be reminded that by understanding the past, that is, by protecting the present, we are not talking about "us" and "them".
There was no “we” and there was no “other.”
It was a time of unrest - that's all we know.
"For which, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme dared to insert, "no part of society can justify itself well.
I'm not blaming anyone.
Whether it was good or bad, what was done was done.
Then it was.
There is nothing more to say, we agree.
And as you should not blame anyone, you should not justify yourself if it was appropriate or if something could be corrected.
But why the past, if not in order to learn -
The past exists in order for us to forget it.
If I can add a word to that –
The pyramid of Luther Rabinovich collapsed.
"I'll look into your report," he said, letting her go.
The next day, on her way to work, she was knocked down by a motorcyclist, who drove on the sidewalk, as described by passers-by, "in a vicious rage."
Coincidences happen.
Lesotho Army Says Coup Wasn't Planned; Prime Minister Remains in South Africa
Representatives of the Lesotho army denied the fact that they were preparing a coup to overthrow the government, saying they were acting against the police who were suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane left the country, saying the country’s army surrounded its official residence and seized government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The prime minister took his family to neighbouring South Africa, saying he was threatened with death.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said there was no coup, but that the army responded to the threat from "political fanatics" that the police were trying to arm.
“What happened this morning is that the Lesotho Armed Forces Command took action after receiving several intelligence reports that there are some elements among the police forces that really plan to arm some political, young political party fanatics who were willing to bring chaos,” he told Voice of America.
Clayson Monella, a spokesman for the South African government, said the military's actions looked like a coup.
“Although no one has claimed power by force, all reports suggest that the actions of Lesotho’s armed forces at the moment have the main signs of a coup,” he said.
Army officials in Lesotho said the soldiers returned to the barracks on Sunday and that the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Motejoa Metsing is running the government in the absence of Tabanan.
Tabane said he believed he was being attacked in connection with an attempt to fight corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho has been very tense since June, when Tabane suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of disagreements in his combined government.
He said his actions did not undermine the government, despite accusations to the contrary.
Chelsea midfielder Marco van Ginkel will spend the upcoming season on rental rights at Milan, reports Milan Channel.
The 21-year-old Dutchman will arrive in Italy in the coming hours for a medical examination.
Last season, he only made three appearances on the field for the London club.
Recall that previously "Milan" rented from "Liverpool" striker Fernando Torres.
Production in the euro area at its lowest level in 13 months
Production growth in the euro area slowed to its lowest in 13 months in August, according to a popular study.
The latest value of the business activity index (PMI) of the manufacturing sector of the euro area according to Markit fell to 50.7 in August, falling from 51.8 in July.
A value above 50 indicates growth.
New orders have been delayed and businesses have suffered amid rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures came before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
Markets will expect a clear plan from the bank as to how to deal with the halting of the eurozone recovery, as well as the threat of deflation with inflation of only 0.3%.
There is speculation that ECB chief Mario Draghi may give additional signals later this week that he is considering a quantitative easing scheme for the euro area similar to those used by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
“Although some growth is better than no growth at all, the slowing effect of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on producers is becoming more apparent,” said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The PMI of Germany’s manufacturing sector, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to its 11-month low of 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the bloc’s second-largest economy, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to cause real concern, as does Italy’s weakening from steady growth to stagnation.
Signs that the growth momentum has faded mainly from the industrial engine, Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, also do not add to confidence,” said Dobson.
The industry’s slowdown is likely to still fuel analysts waiting to introduce additional monetary or fiscal stimulus.
One positive news was from Ireland, where PMI rose to 57.3, its highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, Chief Economist at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing to say about the August study of the Eurozone business activity index is that it shows that the sector is still growing.”
He added: “The producers of the euro zone obviously find life very difficult at the moment, as the current increased geopolitical tension – especially related to Russia/Ukraine – adds uncertainty to the still difficult conditions in many countries.
This heightened tension has obviously hit the business — and especially the consumer confidence — and likely leads to some orders being delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said that “it’s more and more like” that the ECB will, of course, have to carry out some kind of quantitative easing, “although we suspect it will be limited.”
Residents of Mariupol will expose a live chain against the militias
In Mariupol until last week everything was calm - no one dared to organize the Mariupol People's Republic, the city on the Sea of Azov lived and worked.
Now the residents are waiting with horror for the arrival of the "militants".
According to political scientists, separatists break into Mariupol to go to the Sea of Azov - the city of Novoazovsk was recently taken, which was not part of the self-proclaimed republics before that.
The Mariupols decided that the Ukrainian army, although it will defend them, but it has forces a little against the perfectly armed representatives of the DPR-LPR, and they were going to help the military.
They dig trenches, build checkpoints and fortifications.
In the evening on Saturday several thousand residents came to the eastern border of the city, and stood there in a live chain, singing the hymn of Ukraine.
They are going to do the same in the event of an attack.
Volunteers collect and carry equipment and food, collect medicines, publish a newspaper.
In the city, shops are gradually closed, banks and ATMs are stopped.
Ten Years of Hell for the Beslan Survivors: Ten Years of the Horrible School Capture, Like the Children Who Found It, Still Suffer
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan, southern Russia
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed during this three-day trial that shook the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who cheated death during the school atrocity
Exactly ten years after the horrific seizure of the Beslan school, during which 334 people died, including 186 children, heroically survived the disaster warned yesterday evening of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, kidnapped and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of a new quarter, it seemed like an extreme degree of possible evil.
The tragedy brought the East and the West together in disgust, which miraculously then grew into action and hope for the future under the conditions of the gravest grief.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to find some of the victims who cheated death during a school atrocity.
We have found amazing young people who have faced adversity, although the memories of a terrorist hell will live with them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war that is now torturing Ukraine, in which children like them are dying, will now cease.
The girl in the photo is trying to get back into the shelled gym
It is captured in a photograph of the famous Russian photographer Dmitry Beliakov, when in one of the underwear tried to get back into the shelled sports hall after the explosion of the mine.
In desperation, Aida desperately sought out her mother, Larissa, who is now 40.
There were fears that they both died, but in fact they survived.
“The woman told me to run with all her might, but I couldn’t,” Aida said at the time.
My feet were covered in blood.
I got up and went back inside to find my mom.
The soldier picked her up and took her to a safe place.
After a series of surgeries, she thought she had fully recovered, but yesterday she said, "Three months ago, the pain came back.
I'm afraid I might need more surgery.
There are a few shards left in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist, to help people in the same way that doctors helped her.
“This tragedy has changed my life, but it certainly hasn’t broken it,” she says.
“It happened to me and I can’t change that.
Once a year I always go to this gym to remember everyone who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too strong.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my classmate, Dzera Gapoev was killed there.
We played together when we were young, and we dreamed of going to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish school and start working.
I'll think about the family later.
She says the capture remains with her, though the memories fade a little each year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our troubles, and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people from the UK and from everywhere.
When I see a picture on the internet where I walk into a school window, I think a lot of people will see it for the first time, learn about our tragedy and make sure it doesn’t happen again.
A boy who ran through a hail of bullets thinking his mother was dead
It was his first day at school (Russians start school at 7 years old) and he survived three days of capture, hugging his mother Tamara.
Then he was seven, and he said, "My mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion, and hold her hand."
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She said to him, "Run."
Fearing that she was dead, he ran and saw a crying baby on the way, grabbed the child’s hand and ran through the hail of bullets.
His father, Vladimir, who grabbed his son from the outside, said, "Damir told me that his mother was dead.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara went free and was in the hospital with injuries to her legs, in turn thinking that her son had died.
After their reunion, she said, “I was crying with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damira was later brought to London (now the non-existent News of the World) where he was awarded as a Child Protector by Barnardo's Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Sherry.
“This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it,” he said yesterday.
Anyway, I can say that in my memory he faints.
I remember immediately after that I threw away all my toy weapons.
But now I can play computer games with shooting, and that's not a problem for me.
“I’m not afraid to go back to that gym, but I’m not thinking about myself.
I remember the kids I played with in the yard who never got out.
We never say they're dead or dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially a toy shop where I was allowed to choose anything I wanted, and a ride in an open-top car.
But now he fears for places like Ukraine, where wars lead to such grief that he and his friends have experienced.
This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I am so sorry to all those who suffer from these horrors," said Damir, who last week volunteered at the women's monastery.
I want to help.
I want to serve in the police someday and I hope to be enrolled in the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: “37 children were killed in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the horrible silence right after the capture, there were just no children screaming and running around, and that silence lasted for many months.
She clearly remembers her trip with Damir to London.
People in London were crying when I was telling our story.
I understood then how people on the other side of the earth can understand our feelings, can provide support.
She was grateful to Sherry Blair and her foundation for the award and the opportunity to travel to London in the fall of 2004.
I would like to call Sherry and just tell her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damira and me.
I remember when Damir wanted to eat borsch, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with the waiters at the restaurant, Damir shooting at them with his water gun, and they ran away and played with him.
And it was only a month after our nightmare then.
I was shocked that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said: “I don’t think this world has gotten any better in these 10 years.
Now there is war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think many children have been killed and will be killed.
They're just kids like ours.
I think for many people war is a news story that they listen to when they’re bored or when they’re busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, the horror of it.
And I can't stop feeling it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and it’s so sad.
Damir grew up and became a very soft and calm boy, he is not at all aggressive and not evil.
He's not looking for revenge, for example, he's not stuck in this past nightmare.
I know he doesn’t like to remember it, but they’re very close with six classmates, and they go to the gym from time to time and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it - I remember him lying on the couch, turning away from us, for hours.
He didn’t sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw away all his weapons and other military toys. Damiru is now 17, he is above me, cute, smart and healthy.
I can hardly believe that for a few hours I was so sure that he was dead and that I would never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and get up on my feet, I looked around, I saw hell around me when body parts were lying everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that it was impossible for my little boy to survive in this hell.
“I remember shouting at him, ‘Damir, run, run,’ but again I was so sure he didn’t hear me.
But he heard and ran away.
So life goes on for us, unlike so many others.
Georgiy Ilyin, 17 years old
A boy whose shocking photo after the capture became decisive for the tragedy in Beslan
Peace: Beslan survivor George Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the capture in 2004, and George on the right today
There was a scar on his bloody face when he escaped death when Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His photograph was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarism in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, the chief physician, took him to school on the first day of school before taking his eldest son Vladimir to the university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists ran into the yard, so my little boy was left alone for three days of a nightmare," she recalled.
Not alone, there was a family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
It was only George who managed to survive.
The closer this date is, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There is not a single day when we do not remember this tragedy.
We don’t think it’s been a long time, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes of these days all the time in front of my eyes.
No one will ever forget, I promise.
The photo of George (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was immortalized in sculpture (right)
I remember that George wanted to go to school that day so much that he said he wanted to hug the teacher.
I just found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even a sculpture of crying George in San Marino.
George does not like to look at this photo, and it is hidden in a bookcase at our house.
I understand, but I also feel that thanks to this photo, people from all over the world feel our pain.
George now says, “It’s important that this never happens again.
“I doubt we’ll ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and will never know the truth.
They are now investigating the crash of Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what it was called?
This world is going to something very bad.
“I can’t understand how this happens because if you ask people, no one wants war because it happens?
Ten years is nothing for that kind of pain.
It takes us decades to forget a little bit about it.
It has affected my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had nightmares because of the seizure, but now it has gotten better.
I returned to school later in 2004, I was very scared every day.
I thought about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That’s why I keep going to this gym before every September 1.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It’s hard for me to enter the gym, but I have to do it.
I don’t feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget that, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and entered the medical university in Vladikavkaz.
I'm going to study to become a heart surgeon.
My first choice was to join the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health did not allow me.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that will not happen.
Georgiy Farniev, 20 years
A boy who survived despite being at the feet of a terrorist assassin
Unbelievable: George Farniev was at the feet of a terrorist-killer during the capture, but still managed to survive
During the capture, he was photographed in a sports hall sitting next to a bomb at the foot of a terrorist killer.
It is a miracle that he was not killed.
“We think it was yesterday,” says George, who wanted to study for an intelligence officer at the FSB but couldn’t because of the damage that was caused to his health during the capture.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I’m older now, and they say that kids can easily handle bad events — I have to say that’s not true.
“In 2006 I worked with psychologists and I felt a little better after that, but I can’t forget that.
I'd like to forget.
In 2005 – the following year – it was the first and last time I entered this gym again.
I've lost consciousness.
I would never go there again, and please don’t ask me to show you where I sat in this famous photo.
Survivor: Georgiy Farniev today with an open photo of himself in the hospital after the capture
My pain is great and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don’t like to think about it or discuss it, and they never asked me about school.
As far as my physical condition is concerned, I am healthy.
I need to be careful with the knee that was damaged, but now I'm walking normally.
But still, my health did not allow me to go to study at the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including medical records, and they replied that it was impossible.
My second hobby was animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I studied there for two years.
He learns to treat all animals "from cats to cows".
He said: “I know I will never tell my children about my experience.
It’s not something kids need to know, and of course it’s not something they need to experience.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: “This pain never leaves me.
It's in my soul, worse when the anniversary is approaching.
I will go and attend the ceremonies that will be held to celebrate it.
I know George won't go.
For him, it has to be even stronger because he was there and I wasn't.
I waited for him at home and couldn't help.
I'm so grateful to God that he came back to me. Here in Beslan there's an imprint on everyone.
He stays with us.
George is now an adult, but this nightmare is still with him.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair is happening to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knees.
He has had several surgeries, he can walk, but he can’t do sports.
I would say that he has overcome this nightmare by 50%, but it is impossible to completely overcome and forget it.
This horrible experience will stay with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the capture, and it only intensifies my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and who were dear to me.
My son is with me, and this is the best gift God could give me, but my heart hurts for those who were killed.
I know of families where new children were born, but I also know of widows who never married again.
It’s hard to believe that life goes on, even if you don’t want to.
I will never forget how my heart jumped out of my chest the moment I saw him in the hospital.
Now I look at what is happening in the world, wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is very close to our country now, and I can hardly believe it.
We were one friendly country in the past, how did it happen that we are fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure, many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many will be killed.
If it were possible to capture all the rebels and throw them out, as far away as possible.
Alena Tskaeva, 10 years
A baby who was moved to a safe place by a special forces fighter
Rescued: Alena Tskaev is carried to a safe place by a Russian special forces fighter (left).
Now she's ten (right), and she doesn't remember a monstrous crime at all.
The world stopped breathing in 2004, when little Alena was taken by a Russian policeman from a captured school in Beslan.
The terrorists released her, but brutally left her 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Christine and brother Mahara in the gymnasium of the school.
Mahar, who was three years old at the time, was saved, but Alonna's mother and sister were killed in a deadly massacre.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried, and they have a little daughter with his new wife Svetlana, whom he named Kristina in memory of the daughter he lost.
Alena, who is now ten, does not remember anything about the capture and has blossomed into a smart and cheerful girl, say neighbors.
“They’re a big happy family now, and Alena and Mahar are both wonderful children,” says a close friend.
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep them away from all memories when the tenth anniversary is celebrated.
You can understand why.
Midfielder Shinji Kagawa, who returned from Manchester United to Dortmund's Borussia, said he was looking forward to being able to play again in the form of a German club.
According to him, this transfer is a joyous event in his career.
Of course, I am very happy that I will play for Borussia again," Bild said.
I feel very good.
Full of positive emotions and I look forward to being able to go on the field again in the form of "Borussia".
Kagava moved to the "MY" from "Borussia" in the summer of 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, he was never able to join the English club, having spent two seasons in just 38 matches in the English Championship, scoring 6 goals and giving 8 successful transmissions.
Man accused of assaulting a girl at a pedestrian crossing "pelican" in Fife
A 78-year-old man will appear in court on charges of assaulting a three-year-old girl at the pedestrian crossing "Pelican" in Fife.
Gordon Stewart allegedly shot the girl at a crossing at Pittenvine in East New York.
Prosecutors said that Mr. Stewart drove his Audi Q3 without due care and attention and shot the girl, as a result of which she was injured.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruter, denied his guilt in the Dundee Sheriff's Court.
Sheriff Charles McNair, the royal attorney, has set a trial date for January.
Obama, Merkel and Hollande will not be in Vladivostok
The Duty Free trade store of Vladivostok airport has put up a sign prohibiting the purchase of a number of world political leaders in this store.
Don’t drink them with spirits, vodka and cognac.
The administration of the store decided that US President Barack Obama, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande, Vitaly Klitschko, Yulia Tymoshenko, the Prime Minister of Japan and several other famous comrades will not be able to drink vodka, cognac and spirits in their store.
He put a sign on the door.
Earlier, Obama was banned from appearing in an even less accessible service institution - Dietary dining establishments of the MSU, as reported by the website of the institutions of general food.
Whether the American president ever dreamed of eating in a diet dining room in Russia is not known, but the authors of the bans clearly seem to themselves terribly witty.
Is there cheese after the embargo: Medvedev gave advice to farmers
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev believes that under the conditions of the embargo, Russian farmers should learn new technologies to set up the production of cheeses demanded by buyers.
The advice was given during the visit of the company "Yugpticeprom" firm "Agrokomplex".
The head of government also advised restaurateurs to refocus on Russian meat, the quality of which is at the right level.
The annual food import embargo has been imposed in Russia since August 7.
The head coach of the Russian national team Valentin Maslakov is satisfied with the results of the DecaNation tournament.
According to the specialist, the third place is a good result given the lack of targeted preparation for competitions.
Our athletes have performed at their level, - says "All sports" words Maslakov.
Third place is a confirmation of our fairly high command level.
“It’s nice that the advantage of the French and even the Americans over us is minimal.
We have to bear in mind that we have not prepared for this competition.
The season is over and we didn’t oblige our leaders to participate in the DecaNation match.
In recent years we have become second in this tournament, but this season we have renewed the national team.
The French, on the other hand, put out a combat team, which included 13 European champions.
They did not hide their intention to win this year, as they have repeatedly publicly announced.
But even such a composition of the hosts of the competition could not resist the Americans.
Therefore, I believe that the Russians acted in such a representative company at a good level.
But the results in some species were an order of magnitude lower than in the same Diamond League.
The season is over.
Of course, the result is no longer so important to athletes, especially in team-level competitions.
The main thing here was the place.
And according to the results, I agree, it came to an absurdity when at 1500 m men were so fascinated by the tactical tricks of running that they showed the result below the average level... of women's races.
4 tips on how to achieve the best quality of underwater photos and videos
If you want to take pictures or take videos underwater, there are a number of equipment options in front of you.
The cheapest option is a waterproof "sink", for example, the Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an action camera, for example, the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are sold for about $300.
I took these pictures at a family holiday with a few cameras, all at a price of about $350.
No matter what equipment you use, a few rules need to be followed in order to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the camera battery and other compartments are tightly closed.
Also, set up your camera for the type of photos or videos you will be shooting.
Some cameras have shooting modes or object-type modes that optimize exposure for darkened underwater conditions.
And before you jump into the water, figure out how deep your equipment can sink.
Some cameras are only 5 feet, others are 50 or 60 feet.
Take a look at our customer guide and digital camera ratings for both traditional and waterproof models.
Take a few shots - because many of them will not work.
“Mills” have LCDs that will help you compose photos, while action cameras usually don’t.
Even if you have an LCD, it will be difficult to see underwater, and the layout of the frame will be a random process.
So make a few shots.
Also, if your camera has a serial shooting mode that shoots several frames with slightly different exposure settings, use them.
Stay on the surface.
The amount of light decreases significantly the deeper you dive under water.
If possible, stay at the surface when shooting in a pool, river, or ocean.
It will also allow you to convey more color in the photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Get closer to the shooting sites.
This is great advice for shooting on land, but it is even more important underwater due to darkened light conditions.
Especially important if you’re shooting on an action camera: This equipment is often equipped with a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means you’ll have to approach the shooting objects if you want to fill the frame.
The bronze medalist of the 2012 Olympic Games for free wrestling Bilal Mahov can go to the Greco-Roman wrestling.
This was reported by the head coach of the team of Dagestan on the free fight Sajid Sajidov.
The specialist did not rule out the participation of the athlete at the World Championships in Tashkent in September 2014.
Currently Bilal Mahov is on the collection of the team of "classics", - says "R-Sport" the words of Sazhid Sazhidov.
In general, by juniors Bilal performed in both styles.
At the 2005 World Youth Championship, he became the winner of the Volleyball tournament and the third prizewinner in the Greco-Roman competitions and decided to concentrate on freestyle wrestling.
There has long been talk that the new stage of his career will be held by our heavyweight in the Greco-Roman struggle.
I will say more: Mahov can play already at the World Cup in Tashkent - if he wins the pretense.
But the decisive word is always behind the coaching staff headed by Gogi Koguashvili.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose personal power could shake everything around, even in such a giant organization as the National Health Service.
As an anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to rid patients of both the suffering of the disease and the suffering of treatment.
Among those who turned to him, his wife recalls, was an officer of MI-6, who had to live with the devastating consequences of torture.
Lawson realized that while doctors are obsessed with diagnoses and illnesses, those undergoing treatment are mainly concerned about something completely different — pain.
One day in 2007, however, he turned out to be the one who began to suffer.
“I didn’t feel like I usually did,” he wrote in May last year.
It was hard for me to find strength in myself.
Struggling with flu-like symptoms, he found himself irritatedly blaming his wife, Juliet.
“I want everything to happen faster, not later,” he said.
When Juliet left for business for a week, Lawson found that he was unusual and incomprehensible as to why he was upset.
There was something wrong.
He asked a colleague to do a chest X-ray.
Just two weeks earlier, he was skiing in the French Alps.
The X-rays came.
It was mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affects the pleura, or lungs.
For most cancers, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact cause.
Although some smokers have lung cancer, for example, not all lung cancer patients smoked.
But with mesothelioma, it's different.
In almost all cases, the reason is contact with asbestos, a fibrous building material that was once called a "miracle", but which is now known to be deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can be ignored.
Asbestos, after all, is a thing of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when the recommended industrial ban went into effect.
Even when it was used, only people from specific industries worked in close contact with it: pipe insulators, builders, carpenters and dock workers, for example.
An industrial toxin from another era, it is hardly seen as a cause for concern today.
But that kind of calm is wrong.
The UK is now at the peak of the mesothelioma epidemic.
Here, more people die from mesothelioma than in any other country on the planet.
With an annual death rate of about 2,500 people, more than twice as many people die from this disease than from car accidents.
The annual number of deaths from mesothelioma since 1980 and the projected number of deaths in the future in the UK
The reason we feel its deadly effects now is that although the use of asbestos has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), the development of mesothelioma usually takes decades.
And the attack of mesothelioma is not limited to veterans of the specialties of industrial construction.
Asbestos has been, and in many cases remains, embedded in the homes where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we study, and the shops where we go shopping.
As a result, mesothelioma does not pay attention to class, wealth level, profession, or age.
Bastions of choice, from fashionable London department stores to private schools, turned out to be no salvation.
The parliament building is permeated with asbestos.
Even the hospitals that are designed to treat us have turned out to be reservoirs of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a pipe insulator.
In fact, he had to think about where he could come into contact with asbestos.
Then he realized.
“It looks like there could have been a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy’s Hospital, where I spent six years interning,” he wrote.
Everyone - students, nurses, doctors and loaders - used these tunnels.
I wonder how many of my peers will get the same disease?
This was a question he could, unfortunately, give a partial answer to.
"Of the four doctors who were interned at Guy's Hospital and who subsequently developed mesothelioma over the past five years," he said in a 2010 letter, "I was the only one left alive."
How many of us will get sick with this disease?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48 years old.
When he died on February 17 of this year, he was 55.
It's unusual to live that long.
Fifty percent of mesothelioma patients die 8 months after diagnosis.
She's always deadly.
So now we can only repeat the question of Lawson: "How many of us will get the same disease?"
According to the UK’s leading mesothelioma expert, Professor Julian Pitot, it is most likely to assume that between 1970 and 2050, when the UK’s asbestos epidemic is expected to survive, around 90,000 people will die.
Most people don’t know they’re going to die that way.

A quick look at reports from courtrooms, where victims often seek compensation, shows how far the mesothelioma attack has spread.
This June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Janes Ellen had been exposed to asbestos due to indiscretion.
She worked in the network for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, leading clothing departments at two facilities, one of which was the main store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 years old when she started working at M&S.
She now has two children over the age of 20.
“Before that happened,” she says, “I’d never heard of mesothelioma, I barely knew about asbestos.
I couldn’t think of anything that would affect me.
Very few people really know a lot about asbestos.
Asbestos is not a single substance, but a group of six minerals.
They got their name from the word "asbestiform", which means a fibrous structure that gives them strength and flexibility.
Of these six, three were often used in construction.
Chrysotile, widely known as white asbestos, is much more common in buildings today.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, thermal insulation of pipes, boiler seams, even in car brake pads.
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but is still recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as a “serious source of health damage” that can lead to death.
More dangerous, however, are brown asbestos (amositis) and blue asbestos (crocidolite).
The UK was once the largest importer of brown asbestos in the world, and experts suggest that “there are strong, albeit indirect, grounds to believe that this is the main reason for the exceptionally high number of mesothelioma patients [in the UK].”
An employee of Marks & Spencer was exposed to asbestos at the company's main store on Oxford Street, London Alamy
Janes Ellen may not have thought of herself as a typical victim of mesothelioma, but the work of Julian Pitot suggests that her story is far from unusual.
He conducted a study of patients, which suggests that “a significant percentage of mesothelioma, when there is no known impact at work or at home, was most likely caused by exposure to asbestos from the environment.”
Much of this impact, he says, is due to “the usual use and impact of the weather” on our buildings.
No one seems to be sure that he is safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which looked at the Palace of Westminster, shows how people, even in the very center of government, could have been exposed unconsciously.
In 2009, Goddard reported that technical mines and pipelines outside parliamentary committees were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be driven by something as harmless as “strong airflows.”
Members of parliament are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in this case the opposite seems to be true.
Although the Directorate for Maintenance of Parliament insisted that Westminster Palace received a "pure sanitary certificate", it now recognized that it is necessary to carry out work on <0xC2><0xA3>1 billion for the reconstruction of the parliament, improving the vegetative energy and removing asbestos in the parliament, and that after the general elections of 2015 may be a member
The Goddard report noted that "the situation with asbestos was not managed according to different rules."
It is impossible to know whether this mistake of management will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One of those who has never been able to identify their contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, suspects he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
“I worked at a hospital that successfully filed asbestos-related lawsuits,” he says, “but I can’t prove that in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places where he worked and the dates.
What he clearly remembers is the day in early December 2009 when he was struck by something that looked like a flu.
He was 45, and he was in the middle of the operation late at night.
Suddenly, I started to have a fever.
It started very quickly.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't go all the way home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain came from the pleura, the shells around the lungs.
However, like Janes Ellen, he simply had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.
Eventually, he couldn’t go to work for a month.
Confused doctors took X-rays of the chest and placed pleural catheters to extract the fluid from the lungs and send it for testing.
Yet his condition was left without a diagnosis.
Gradually his health improved, and he returned to work.
But from time to time, the same symptoms returned, often after he had exercised and had difficulty breathing.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients came to him with similar symptoms, and he was subsequently diagnosed with "mesothelioma".
However, even then Abbott did not associate this with his own case.
After all, his patient was decades older and worked with asbestos directly.
The connection in this case was obvious.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened again, and the doctor who consulted him showed him CT results and X-rays to a group of specialists.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel bad, a sensor equipped with a camera was inserted into the cavity between the shell of his chest and the shell of his lung.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just keep going,” he says.
I wasn't too worried about it, to be honest.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy came in the week between Christmas and the New Year: “I was told it was mesothelioma.”
Graham Abbott: Mesothelioma diagnosed
Suddenly, Abbott plunged into a meeting with Macmillan’s nurses, one of whom invited him to contact a lawyer.
It was then that he realized the scale of the epidemic.
“It turns out that asbestos was widely used, especially in large public buildings, where there was quite often asbestos thermal insulation on the pipes,” he says.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now getting the disease.
Thus, mesothelioma now affects younger people of atypical professions.
The most dangerous asbestos-insulated tubes in hospitals were in basements, so it is unlikely that patients would be injured.
But many employees who walked through pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson), or ate in basement dining rooms (like Graham Abbott often did) were almost certainly really exposed to the toxic substance.
For several decades after the war, it turns out, hospitals were a place where, in theory, they saved lives for patients, but a place that posed a threat to life for the doctors who treated them.
It is still being removed today.
Schoolchildren installed their Bunsen burners on asbestos stands
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos has often been used in offices, shops, libraries, and city halls because of its amazing insulation and fire-resistant properties.
Schools too.
In fact, many were likely exposed to asbestos for the first time in the classroom.
Throughout the country, in countless chemistry lessons, schoolchildren installed their Bunsen burners on asbestos stands.
There were websites that focused on the problem of asbestos in schools.
Meanwhile, in our homes, harmless things like tiles or shed roofs tend to contain asbestos.
“It’s industrial poison, embedded in a huge number of our buildings,” said Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in the lawsuit against Guy’s hospital.
In one case, the only contact that a sick woman could remember was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful, wear garden sheds.
The effect of diagnosis, when it is known that the disease is incurable, is enormous.
“It takes a lot of time to realize that,” says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn’t focus on what I was doing.
I was in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized that I had to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I won't meet Christmas again.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from the position of the doctor to the position of the patient.
Like the countless number of patients before him, he remembers how he was deluded by the amount of information that had to be taken.
“It was hard to understand everything,” he says.
“I asked my doctor, ‘How much time do I have?’
I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to meet Christmas anymore.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is especially dangerous, because it is the mechanics of how we support life — the act of breathing itself — that causes cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by contact with asbestos.
Asbestos is made up of tiny fibers.
When asbestos breaks down and the fibers are inhaled, they can get stuck in the pleura, the lung shell.
Asbestos fibers irritate the pleura and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem arises from the inhalation of needle fibers of asbestos," said Professor Tom Treger, a cardiothoracic surgeon who came to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
It was the hospital where, as Andrew Lawson suspected, he was exposed to asbestos, now, ironically, the leading center for the treatment of mesothelioma.
Marker knew Lawson and was treating some others who were probably exposed while interning in the hospital.
When asbestos needles enter the lung tissue, Treger says, "breathing pushes them out to the periphery, where the shell is located.
This is, in fact, an invasive process from the very beginning.
The usual treatment options for other forms of cancer are much less effective in mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgical intervention, for example, causes hot disputes.
Some people think it’s worth trying.
Treasurer disagrees.
“It’s impossible to cut out a pleura,” he says.
It is impossible to walk around with a knife.
Meanwhile, this cancer “doesn’t respond very well to chemotherapy,” which “works,” but doesn’t cure.
“From time to time, there are patients who live a long time,” says Treger.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much, much longer than expected.
Writer Steven J. Gould died 20 years after his diagnosis.
Two and a half years after the diagnosis, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After he became ill with mesothelioma, Abbott was introduced to Andrew Lawson, who, four years after being diagnosed, turned into a support and consultation desk for the same patients.
"Hello, Cancer Central," he said cheerfully when they called.
“He was very positive,” Abbott says.
He was diagnosed four years ago, and he's still very energetic.
Abbott was first offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would take four months and extend his life by just one month.
“I was desperate,” he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, “smartly gave everything a slightly more positive color.”
After meeting with several specialists, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loik Lang-Lazdunski, a professor of thoracic surgery at Guy's Hospital.
“We had the advantage that I didn’t need a direction, I just called them and they accepted me,” admits Graham.
The average patient would have to receive referral and approval for funding.
Money plays a crucial role for patients with mesothelioma in order to get the best of the available treatments.
However, when such treatment finally proves to be ineffective, many patients face yet another financial cause for concern – the future of the families they leave behind.
And then they turn to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“Asbestos has been known to be harmful to health since 1898,” says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it became clear that even very small amounts could put health at risk.
It was then that we talked about the dishonesty of the companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy’s Hospital eventually settled the case, but it was not a “full-cost settlement,” Morgan said, as Lawson was unable to unequivocally prove that his mesothelioma was the result of contact with asbestos at Guy’s Hospital.
After the investigation of his death, the representative of the hospital Guy nevertheless confirmed that "asbestos in the basements in question was removed in the 1990s".
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, tying deadly contact with asbestos to one company or place of work — usually decades later — was a big problem for mesothelioma patients requiring compensation.
Many of their former employers have changed owners or closed down.
The insurance records could have been lost.
And those who defend themselves against lawsuits know that they have time on their side, which the plaintiffs certainly do not have.
In response, this year came serious new legislation that facilitates the process of recovering compensation for patients with mesothelioma, even if their former employers cannot be traced.
Under the law, a <0xC2><0xA3>350 million fund has been set up, funded by the insurance industry, for those diagnosed after July 2012 and who can prove contact, but who can’t sue anyone.
In such cases, patients will receive 80 percent of the amount that the court could award in a normal compensation case - about <0xC2><0xA3>120,000.
About 300 successful lawsuits under this scheme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like many who work with mesothelioma patients, believes that <0xC2><0xA3>350 million is a “very good job” for the insurance industry.
“This is a deal written by insurers for insurers,” he says, hinting that the amount is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if the time interval had not intervened and patients with mesothelioma could trace the companies and file a lawsuit in the usual way.
Even Mike Penning, former Minister of Labor and Pensions, acknowledged that the law was “imperfect.”
However, both Penning and Morgan admit that while seven people die each day, rapid action was necessary.
“People are suffering so much, and they need help today,” Penning said during the second reading of the Mesothelioma Bill last December.
By that time, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Professor Loike Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After the initial consultations, Langz-Lazdunski recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Trager, he considered effective.
This was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a tritherapy in which Lang-Lazdunsky boasts as much as 40 percent of the patients who survived in five years.
Abbott felt a surge of strength.
“This is, of course, one of the most important things,” says Abbott.
You see it in patients all the time.
There is a power that supports you.
When you give up, the condition can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott was admitted to surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Subsequent scans did not show any trace of the disease.
Then I did a scan in March [2014].
There were a few spots [cancer] in my chest.
I should have just turned 50.
It's not a threat to life.
It's the end of life.
And again, Abbott went through six cycles of chemotherapy.
There are no traces of tumors.
However, this process is both physically and emotionally difficult.
You can think about practical things — about finances when I die, for example, or about showing my wife how the timer works on the boiler.
When you get bad news, you become unhappy.
We need to look forward.
Like Ellie's father, 16, and Tamsin, 14, it's not always easy.
“It’s hard for a parent,” he says.
It’s hard to know what to say and how much to say.
When I was first diagnosed, I told the girls that I had a disease, which means I wouldn’t live to be old.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and energetic.
She told all her friends, and many of us called very quickly.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to face.
But for patients with mesothelioma, such discussions are not balanced by hope, even a glimmer of survival.
This disease carries with it (even as, in the end, for Stephen Jay Gould) a dark certainty.
As Andrew Morgan said, “Mesothelioma is not a threat to life.
The bodies of embalmed pharaohs are wrapped in asbestos fabrics.
Asbestos fibers are used to strengthen pots and increase heat resistance.
Pliny the Elder describes asbestos.
Now a fabric has been invented that does not ignite.
I saw the napkins made of it smoldering in the fireplaces at banquets
Modern commercial use of asbestos begins in Italy, where it is used to make paper (even banknotes) and fabrics.
Large asbestos mines open in Canada and South Africa and shortly thereafter in America, Italy and Russia.
It is the ideal heat insulator for steam engines and turbines of the Industrial Revolution.
Worldwide asbestos production is growing to more than 30,000 tons per year.
Statistics from Prudential reveal premature mortality among those who work with asbestos and are therefore denied life insurance.
Nellie Kershaw is dying in Rochdale.
Dr. William Cook testified that the asbestos particles in her lungs “were, without a doubt, the main cause of death.”
This is the first case of this type.
Kershaw’s employers, Turner Bros. Asbestos, do not accept responsibility.
Compensation is not paid.
During the Second World War, shipbuilding developed intensively, one of the most deadly professions in terms of contact with asbestos.
Voluntary industrial ban on the import of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal upholds the UK’s first successful health claim for harm caused by contact with asbestos.
Worldwide asbestos production grows to more than 4213000 tons per year.
The UK imports 139,000 tonnes.
The UK’s Health and Industrial Safety Executive Committee requires all contractors working with asbestos to be licensed.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited by law in the UK.
All use of asbestos is prohibited in the UK.
The Mesothelioma Act was passed in the UK.
A compensation scheme of <0xC2><0xA3>350 million has been announced.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but white asbestos is still used in cheap building materials in many parts of the world.
Global production is maintained at about 2 million tons per year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to elect leaders; protesters vow revenge
China’s parliament decided on Sunday not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 election, despite growing demands for democratic reform.
This move is likely to kick-start long-promised protests in Hong Kong’s business district, as activists began planning and mobilizing within hours of the announcement.
The decision of the People’s Assembly of China, in essence, allows communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
“It hasn’t deceived our expectations, but it still drives us to anger,” said Emily Lau, the Democratic Party’s chairman.
This is not what Beijing has promised.
They deceived the people of Hong Kong.
And it is obvious that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
Defending China’s decision, Li Fei, deputy secretary general of the Standing Committee of the People’s Assembly of China, said allowing a nationwide run for Hong Kong’s leadership would be too “chaotic.”
Since 1997, when Britain handed control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing has promised to allow the people of the region to elect the head of government by voting, starting in 2017.
Chinese leaders presented the decision on Sunday as a democratic step forward as it gives Hong Kongers the right to vote directly; however, the decision also makes it clear that Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process firmly in their hands with the help of a nominating commission, tightly controlled from Beijing.
And, according to the new article, only candidates who “love the country and love Hong Kong” will be admitted.
The decision came after the summer, when some of the largest and most widely publicized protests in Hong Kong took place over many years.
A major part of the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shut down Hong Kong’s financial district if Beijing does not guarantee real universal suffrage.
On Sunday night, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain outside the Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement is moving to a new stage of civil disobedience and that they will rise on the waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide details, obviously, in an effort to avoid problems with state authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers said that the movement “considered the possibility of seizing the central area only as an exceptional measure, an action that can only be taken if all the possibilities of dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are very sorry to report that to date all the possibilities for dialogue have been exhausted and the capture of the central area will undoubtedly take place.
Hong Kong authorities were preparing for Beijing's statement for several days, and security measures involving police and barricades were stepped up at the government's headquarters on Sunday.
At the heart of the unrest is the feeling that many in Hong Kong are slowly losing control of their own city.
The influx of inhabitants from the mainland increases competition in the field of goods and services.
There is also a growing fear that Hong Kong’s values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are starting to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticize the Occupy Central movement, saying that its demonstrations put at risk the business - the source of Hong Kong's vitality.
“The protest they’re talking about could cause a lot of economic damage depending on how many people are involved and how long,” said Regina Ip, a lawmaker who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to spread the concern that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
This is a bad idea for investment.
Chinese state media have also been reporting on recent days in which Hong Kong activists of the democratic movement have been shown by Western-led saboteurs.
This summer, activists staged an informal referendum on the right to vote, which attracted 780,000 participants - more than one-fifth of Hong Kong's voters.
And in July, tens of thousands marched to one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region’s history.
American graduation culture reaches university life: first-year students are offered to arrive on a private plane
We are pleased to respond to this demand by launching the UK’s first “luxury” travel service for current students.
To leave a vivid impression of the arrival at the university, the company also offers transportation options such as a private jet, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also said that the service had thought about safety.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who usually have to carry their belongings across the country in a dangerously crowded car.
Combined with our new options for VIF, we look forward to helping this year’s students get to university with minimal effort and maximum luxury.
A company representative said that, since this service has just been launched, orders have not yet been received, but added that "students will start ordering this service in the next few weeks."
The company also said that despite the fact that students face the need to pay <0xC2><0xA3>9000 per year for their studies, it still hopes to find a market for this service.
Current students are quite different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and expectations: it’s more important than ever to make a great first impression, and VIF is exactly what it takes.
However, the National Union of Students criticized the service as being detached from reality.
Megan Dunn, NSS Vice President for Higher Education, said: “This project seems incredibly disconnected from the lives of most students.
Many students who will begin their studies at the university this month are facing a cost-of-living crisis when affordable financial support in the form of loans and grants fails to meet the rapidly rising costs of basic needs before they can even begin to think about how to raise thousands of pounds.
Feminists raise the issue of race and police conduct after Ferguson
An unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
The attendees raise their hands, chanting, “Hands up, don’t shoot,” while they wait in line for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, linked to the murder of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a shift in online conversation among white feminists.
According to her experience, white feminists, who left comments, put gender above race when it came to promoting reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as tensions in the Midwest grew and attracted national attention, Perez saw responses from white women who focused 100 percent on race.
Compared to the reaction of black women shortly after the August 9 murder, personal essays with headlines such as “Thoughts on Ferguson from a White Woman” and “Feminism Is Not Just About Oppressing Women” appeared relatively late.
But for Perez, they showed a significant shift.
“In feminism, I don’t think there are a lot of people who talk about white skin color and privileges at such a high level,” she said.
People felt the need to say something about what happened.
This is very symbolic of the crisis we have faced, and because (the situation in Ferguson) is so tied to race, they felt it needed to be pointed out.
For a professor of English at Ohio State University, Mitchell Ferguson uncovered the problems that black Americans face every day, but which are not perceived as "female problems" in the cultural sphere.
“I can write something funny on Facebook about what’s going on with me and my partner, and I’ll get 150 likes from everywhere,” Mitchell says.
When I write something about how people of color are attacked in their own country, silence is deafening.
“Why is it safe for women to speak publicly about relationships, but not about public safety?” she asks.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied issues of race, gender, and sexuality in U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between issues of race and gender.
From her point of view, black women are in a position to clearly divide these issues; they face a complex reality every day.
While white women now combine issues of race and gender in the feminist mainstream, Angela Hattery, a professor of women’s and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
“Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched, and the basis for this almost always was the rape of a white woman,” said Hattery.
It took a white woman to confirm the story to justify lynching.
From Hatter’s point of view, the gap between white and black women occurred when white suffragists such as Susan B. Anthony studied the situation in the late 1800s and saw that the fight for the right to vote would be effective only for one of the groups: women or blacks.
"They decided to put all the eggs in the voting basket for women, and the voting right for blacks should have appeared later," Hattery said.
Looking back at things like this gives us a clear idea of why colored women don’t trust white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years for white women to unite against lynching into the Southern Women’s Association for the Prevention of lynching.
The group emerged almost 40 years after black women first asked for help, Mitchell said.
From Mitchell’s point of view, the rise of white feminists’ reactions to the problems raised by the Ferguson situation—police behavior, racial discrimination—reflects a time when white feminists had to “hunt” the problems that black women faced in several generations.
“Truly, it would be great if activists who have such [traditional feminist] ideology were as serious about the right to raise a child as they are about the right to contraception?” she asked.
Second-wave feminists who have made careers in the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives are now beginning to understand what it means.
Famous white feminist Gloria Steinem, two weeks after the murder of Michael Brown, took advantage of Facebook and published a sharp article by Guardian columnist Rebecca Carroll that called for white Americans to take more part in the protests.
"I hope that women who have a different but similar reason to understand the danger in the body - and views on racial issues that differ significantly in public surveys - will be at the forefront of change," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem advocates for a more intersecting feminism that includes both racial and gender issues, her comments on race in America still surprise some.
American Entrepreneurship Institute researcher Christina Summers, author of Who Stole Feminism?, told She The People that young men in the United States, especially colored young people, are “much more vulnerable than their sisters,” but Steinem’s remarks about Ferguson contradict the criticism.
Now we have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently initiated a small program, “Watch My Brother,” to help vulnerable black and Hispanic-speaking youths, there was an angry reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Stein.
The police’s relationship with the black community is not the only problem that advances the line of traditional feminism.
After the U.S. Border Service arrested about 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the country’s southwestern border this year, immigration reform has once again surfaced – this time as a women’s issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that in order to present this issue as important for women, she just needed to share the stories of immigrant women.
“They speak for themselves,” Mercado said.
When the vast majority of work visas are issued [to male immigrants], the women who come with them find themselves in a position vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
“These stories are being addressed by women’s organizations,” she said.
Ipswich house "with pigs" for sale
The photo of the house on sale in Suffolk was removed by real estate agents when it turned out that it depicted a large pig resting in the living room.
Listed for sale for <0xC2><0xA3>120,000, a detached one-bedroom house stands on a private road in Ipswich.
The detailed description was distinguished by the photo of the living room of the house - which depicted a pig with a head resting on the sofa.
The Connells real estate agency said the pig in the photo was the owner’s pet.
“However, the photo was mistakenly placed and has already been removed,” a company representative said.
In a detailed description of the house, Connells described the former assembly house as "a unique one-bedroom detached house".
Despite the fact that the agency has removed the photo from its website, it is still preserved in advertising materials.

According to the athlete, she wants to finish the year with dignity and try to reach a new level, reports Vasily OSIPOV from New York.
How would you rate your results at this year’s Grand Slam tournaments?
Of course, I'm glad I managed to win at Roland Garros.
As for the other three tournaments, I lacked stability, especially at the end of some matches.
Now, of course, I'm upset.
I couldn’t even make it to the quarter-finals.
What are your goals for the end of the season?
After the offensive defeat, I have a huge motivation to go to a new level.
I have a lot to work on, and I’m going to do my best to finish the year well.
The Asian series of tournaments begins in a couple of weeks.
A member of the State Duma Committee on Physical Culture, Sport and Youth Affairs, former World Champion Nikolay Valuyev proposed to give bonuses for the implementation of GTO norms when entering universities.
According to him, in general, the norms will be the same as in Soviet times, people will pass the norms on pulling, running and other exercises.
Recall, 12 subjects of Russia will begin to implement GTO norms on their territory from September 1.
I also suggested to the students who handed over the GTO, to give bonuses when entering universities, - said Valuyev.
For example, they can add a little points to the EGE.
There are also offers to give additional out-of-work to employees of enterprises that have passed these sports tests.

The Ministry of Economic Development wants to accelerate the growth of the market of electric cars
This week, the Ministry of Economic Development will bring to the government an integrated plan for the development of environmentally friendly transport in Russia, said Oleg Pluzhnikov, the deputy director of the department of the Ministry at the round table held by Vedomosti at the Moscow Motor Show in 2014.
The plan is commissioned by the government and one of the main goals is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
It is expected that the document will be adopted in late September - early October, says Pluzhnikov, the proposed measures concerning electric cars and hybrids - a plan for the development of vehicles on gas-powered fuel in Russia already exists.
The plan (a copy is available at Vedomosti) is designed for 2014-2017.
Criteria for the evaluation of electric and hybrid transport are to be developed and how to stimulate the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles.
The report to the government, which will describe tax and customs measures to support electric transport, will be prepared by December 2014; the scheme of preferential lending and preferential leasing will appear by April 2015; and proposals to reduce the price of machines, stimulate localization and create a service infrastructure will be developed in 2015.
In 2014-2015, it is planned to make changes to the regulatory acts to facilitate the conditions for the construction of charging infrastructure (in parking lots, gas stations, etc.).
In addition, federal officials intend to formulate proposals for regional authorities during 2015 to also encourage the use of environmentally friendly transport - in the form of giving it an advantage in traffic and parking, for example; and by February 2016 - and proposals to expand public procurement of such transport.
Finally, by October 2014, the Ministry of Economic Development will include in the list of indicators of evaluation of the activities of regional authorities criteria that reflect the effectiveness of supporting the production of environmentally friendly transport, the development of charging infrastructure.
The market of electric cars in Russia is still being formed - in 2013 around 100 electric cars were sold throughout the country.
In early 2014, the import duty on electric cars was zeroed, so sales will amount to about 500 pieces, predicts the CEO of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia Andrey Pankov.
But the five-fold growth does not make electric cars in any way noticeable: in 2013, according to the Association of European Business, 2.78 million cars and light commercial vehicles were sold in Russia.
Currently, only Mitsubishi Motors imports electric vehicles to Russia.
Renault is preparing to start importing – the company is primarily focused on corporate customers, says the director of strategic planning and partnerships Renault in Russia Nicolas Remis.
Most other manufacturers of electric transport took a waiting position with regard to Russia.
The development of electric cars is also at the Russian manufacturers - "GAZA", ", but the output is poor.
For example, in January-July 2014, according to the "ASM-holding", "AvtoVAZ" produced 30 electric cars.
Demand is low due to the expensiveness of electric cars, admits the director of AutoVAZ for engineering Sergey Amanov, without state support there will be no breakthrough in this segment.
The development of the Russian market of electric cars in addition to the expensiveness of cars (the electric cars sold in Russia, on average, twice as expensive as analogues with internal combustion engines) restrains the indevelopment of charging infrastructure (refueling - units), sighs the genera
Due to the cost and the low rate of cost reduction, electric cars in the next 3-4 years will remain a niche segment of the Russian market, predicts the editor-in-chief of Author Mikhail Podorozansky, Celikov agrees with him.
Automakers, on the contrary, say that some models of electric cars are already close to the cost of conventional ones.
The Russian electric car market has good prospects, the main thing is to instill confidence in consumers that "electromobility" is real; this, in particular, will contribute to the emergence of more and more new charging stations, emphasizes the president of the BMW Group in Russia Wolfgang Schlimme.
Such infrastructure projects are implemented, for example, by the state-owned company "Rosseti": several stations have been built in Moscow, about 80 more will soon appear.
Negotiations on the construction of a network of filling stations are also underway with other regions.
According to the director of the department of “Rossets” Vladimir Sofia, the company believes in the market of electric cars and is ready to build filling stations throughout the country, but there are also problems: a small number of electric cars in the country and the lack of a single standard for charging electric cars of different brands.
In addition, "Rosseti" as a network company have no right to engage in the sale of electricity, it is working out the possibility to do this with regard to the charging of electric vehicles.
Pankov believes that the most effective measure of state support for the formation of the market of electric cars in Russia is the abolition of customs duties.
The zero rate will be valid until the end of 2014, the possibility of its extension and extension of the preferential list is being worked out.
Replacing transportation tax with environmental (the idea is discussed and applies to all cars) will also support the market, but not as noticeable as customs preferences, Pankov believes.
Transport tax in Russia is low, says Pankov, unlike, for example, Norway, where the tax cut has led to a sharp increase in sales of electric cars - now they account for 12% of the market.
In Russia, incentive measures are also needed for car owners, such as free parking in the city center (as they have already done in Moscow), Pankov is sure, or the possibility of moving electric cars on designated lanes, which is not yet available in Russia.
A private plane crashed in Colorado.
The Piper PA-46 single-engine aircraft crashed in the U.S. state of Colorado.
Three of the five people in it have died, reports ITAR-TASS.
The survivors were taken to the hospital.
The accident occurred a few kilometers from the runway of the airport in the city of Denver.
The causes of the tragedy are now being established.
In the Donetsk region deal with the captured militants of the battalion "Donbass".
The executioners were surrounded by Ilovaysk.
They were betrayed by their own commanders, and dozens of security forces were killed under fire.
Those who survived say that if they knew what the situation is in the southeast of Ukraine, they would not go to war.
108 prisoners can be called lucky ones.
Punishers from the "Donbass" battalion remained alive after the "meat grinder", which they fell into under Ilovaisky.
Surrounded by the army of the Donetsk People's Republic, the militants spent several days, actually abandoned by their commanders and the authorities of Ukraine.
When it was reported from the headquarters that it was possible to exit the "ring" through the allegedly provided corridor, the column moved.
But literally in a couple of minutes, bullets and bullets flew from all sides.
"Judging by the information that was given to me, we had a corridor, we were allowed to leave," says the deputy commander of the battalion, who has the nickname "Lermontov".
And when we descended into the lowlands between Mnogopol and Chervonoselsky, a crossfire began with anti-tank controlled missiles, with "doughnuts", 30-mm grenade launchers, BMD automatic cannons, small arms.
There were four cars in front of me and three in the back, and in the end there were only two cars left.
An officer with the nickname "Lermontov" tells: almost immediately at least 60 people died, dozens were injured, many died afterward.
Survivors are now receiving medical care from those they came to kill.
Now the prisoners are surprised that the so-called "terrorists" treat them well, give food, medicines.
While their own commanders actually deceived them and condemned them to true death.
They just betrayed us, they say.
The column, the whole battalion, to destroy it.
In the battalion "Donbass", like many of his comrades, Alexei volunteered, because in the Ukrainian news they told about the atrocities that were allegedly committed in the south-east "separatists".
Alexei has already seen a completely different picture here.
His mother was killed in Luhansk - and not anyone, but the Ukrainian military.
A friend of mine called me, told me that there was a mortar shelling, that it was probably the Ukrainian armed forces, - says one of the soldiers, Alexei.
I wanted to leave the battalion.
We were not released from Ilovaysk, they said we were in the ring.
I've already agreed with the commander, I've already written a report about the departure.
We were immediately taken to Ilovaysk from the collections from Zurahovo.
According to the prisoners, 300-350 people were trapped in the "boiler" near Ilovaysk.
Now some survivors admit that if it was possible to turn back time, they would not have joined the penal battalion at all.
All the prisoners were handed over to the DPR forces.
Everyone will be checked for involvement in war crimes.
The region has established a headquarters to limit the prices of products
In the Krasnoyarsk region, a headquarters has been created, which will, if necessary, limit the growth of prices for products in the market of the region.
The decree on the establishment of this structure has already been signed.
The headquarters included members of the regional government, representatives of the executive branch and supervisory authorities.
Together they will monitor the prices of agricultural products in the region.
News Economy – Will Kiev “Rosneft” compensate $140 million of losses?
The head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, said that the company estimates the damage from the shelling of Lisichansky gas station in Ukraine at $140 million.
He said this in an interview with Spiegel.
"We estimate the damage at $140 million and will negotiate with the Ukrainian government on the payment of compensation," Sechin said.
According to him, the commissioning of the modernized Lisichansky PPP was planned in 2014.
However, part of the plant was destroyed by Ukrainian artillery.
“There were no fighting, there were no ‘battered rebels’, but Ukrainian artillery destroyed part of the industrial facility.
In addition, the technological oil pumped into the pipes is missing,” he said.
Recall that on July 18, in connection with the shelling of the Lisychansky refinery burned the oil storage tank and destroyed the buildings of two warehouses.
Lisychansky refinery - the main oil refinery in Ukraine, first of all the enterprise was put into operation in October 1976.
The total capacity of the Lisichan refinery is about 7 million tons of petroleum raw materials per year.
The plant is able to produce fuel of the Euro-4 standard, as well as batches of diesel of the Euro-5 standard.
In March 2012, the supply of oil to the Lisichansky refinery was suspended due to its loss of life.
It was decided to start repairs at the company.
A year later, Rosneft received Lisichanski NPZ along with other Ukrainian assets of TNK-VR.
The DPRK launched a short-range projectile towards the Sea of Japan.
According to South Korean media, this happened around 10:30 a.m. local time from Chagando province, which is on the border of North Korea and China.
According to Interfax in the Joint Committee of Chiefs of Staff of South Korea, the missile allegedly fell into the Sea of Japan after flying about 220 kilometers.
The ruble is falling amid geopolitical pressure
On the Moscow Stock Exchange, the dollar grew at the opening by 3 cop. to 37.15 rubles, the ruble fell to the bi-currency basket against the background of geopolitical tensions.
Trades on the ETS on the dollar started with transactions in the range of 37.11-37.2 rubles/$1, on average in two minutes the exchange rate is fixed at 37.16 rubles/$1, this is 4 kop. above the level of the previous closure.
The exchange rate of the euro was 48.79 rubles for 1 euro, which is 3 kop. higher than the previous closing level.
The price of the bicurrency basket added 3.5 kop. and amounted to 42,395 rubles.
The U.S. dollar is traded at 23 cents above the official exchange rate, while the euro is traded at 16 cents above the official exchange rate.
The Russian market on Friday, August 29, continued a rapid decline, but this time there was no panic.
It continued to cheapen the ruble and even updated the historical maximum to the dollar.
Investors are already anticipating the deterioration of the geopolitical situation and possible new sanctions against Russia.
However, for now it is more like an artificial hysteria bloated through the media, especially the Western ones.
There are not many options for imposing new sanctions on Russia.
At the opening of the Moscow Stock Exchange, the ruble continues to sharply weaken against the bi-currency basket.
The geopolitical background remains a determining factor.
However, if we do not see a new negative in the near future, both Russian indices and the position of the national currency can be adjusted.
"Orenburg Airlines" will sue "Ideal-Tour"
"Orenburg Airlines" filed "Ideal-Tour" claims for a total amount of 4.7 billion rubles.
We are talking about two cases, which will be held in October.
There will be different judges to deal with.
According to Interfax, the first lawsuit was filed on August 14.
Its amount is slightly more than 425 million rubles.
The meeting was scheduled for October 7th.
The second application was submitted on 18 August.
Its amount is 4.24 billion rubles.
The meeting was scheduled for October 2nd.
As reported to journalists in the Russian Union of tourism industry, judges on cases are appointed different.
In July, information appeared in the media about the debts of the "Ideal-tour" to the "Orenburg Avenues" in the amount of 1.5 billion rubles.
The airline’s chief executive, Viktor Zukin, is talking about a sum of 1.6 billion rubles.
General Director of "Aeroflot" Vitaliy Savelyev calls an even larger amount - two billion rubles.
Twitter is trying to make it more interesting for new users.
The microblogging service Twitter has changed the user registration process to involve new participants more quickly in active interaction with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of people who have abandoned their microblogs.
Now, new Twitter users will view a large number of accounts recommended by the service during registration to immediately make up their reading circle.
Recommendations are made on the basis of the interests indicated in the registration.
At the same time, Twitter automatically sets a subscription tick for all automatically selected accounts.
Because of this, the user will have to remove the ticks himself, so as not to read those who are not interested in him.
If previously microblogging users only saw avatars of recommended users, now Twitter takes a sample of one of the blogger’s popular tweets to help make an impression about a person.
This is the biggest change to Twitter’s registration page in three years.
Recently, Twitter is actively working on the modernization of the service.
Such activity is primarily related to the ongoing attempts of the service to achieve losslessness.
In 2014, the microblogging service faced a slowdown in user base growth and a decline in reader activity.
The company is now desperately in need of more loyal consumer resources, which, once in a while, would have stayed for a long time.
This is the only way to ensure a stable flow of advertising funds.
The Day of Knowledge in Moscow will be bleak and rainy
The first of September in the Moscow region throughout the day will be cool and rainy, meteorologists report.
The air temperature in Moscow will be from 16 to 18 degrees, in the Moscow region - 13-18 degrees.
With cloudy with clear weather places will rain, the wind of the eastern quarter at the same time will be quite weak - only 3-8 meters per second.
The car recycling program has resumed since September 1st.
From September 1 in Russia resumes the program on the recycling of cars.
By December 31, 2014, 10 billion rubles will be allocated for these purposes.
As explained by the head of the Ministry of Commerce of the Russian Federation Denis Manturov, the money is allocated from the limits that have already been brought to the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation by redistribution from other areas of support.
The program will affect all cars older than six years.
The amount of compensation will be from 40 thousand for a car to 350,000 rubles for a truck.
Previously, a similar program of car recycling was already in place in Russia.
The main difference of the current project, the minister explained, is that it is now assumed not only the recycling of cars for a subsequent discount, but also the possibility in the event that the car has reached the age of more than six years, to buy a new one with a discount when handing the old one in "trade-in" from the dealer, Interfax reports.
More than 16 billion rubles were spent on the previous federal recycling program, which ran from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2011.
Thanks to it, the level of production of passenger cars in 2010 amounted to about 1.2 million pieces (this is a plus of 101.4% compared to 2009).
The creator of Coming Out Simulator will release a game about modern journalism
Game designer Nikki Case, famous for the game Coming Out Simulator decided to release a game about modern journalism.
He spoke about his project in an interview with Kill Screen.
Case started working on the game a few weeks ago, but this fact has only now become widely known.
The source of inspiration for the game was the events in Ferguson, where protests are now taking place, which began after a policeman killed an unarmed black teenager.
The focus of the project, which has yet to be named, will be how information coverage of stories affects their consequences.
The hero of the game, a civilian journalist, will need to photograph what is happening in the areas where there are clashes between the police and the population.
The hero can photograph what is happening in different ways, which will affect the course of events.
If he shoots the scene in such a way that the police will look like heroes, and the protesters will look like bandits, the police will start to treat him better and let him go where the ordinary man cannot go.
If he covers events differently, his photographs could turn peaceful protests into a massive uprising.
Points in the game will need to be scored with the help of the hero's Twitter, in which new subscribers will appear, if the photos posted there will prove popular.
The game has no name yet.
The release date and the platform on which it will appear are unknown.
Case, however, has published an image showing how an event can change depending on how a photograph of it is taken and processed.
In an interview with Kill Screen, Case explained that he had been thinking about the concept of such a game for a long time, but initially wanted to dedicate it not to protests in the United States, but to events in the Gaza Strip.
After he started collecting material for the game, the game designer realized that he lacked the knowledge and skills to illuminate the history of the region.
However, when he saw how the media covered the events in Ferguson, he decided to make a game based on the motives of what happened.
Nikki Case is an independent developer who produces browser games.
His most famous project was Coming Out Simulator, which was released in 2014.
This game, which tells the story of events from the biography of Case himself, is dedicated to how a bisexual teenager tries to tell his homophobic parents about his relationship.
Geletei drags Ukraine into the continuation of bloodshed
By calling to prepare for the next “tens of thousands” of victims, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Valery Geletey is dragging the people into the continuation of the bloody confrontation, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
“In Moscow, of course, attention was paid to the statements of the head of the Ukrainian military department Valeriy Geletey, who said about the “completion of the operation to free the East of Ukraine from terrorists” and the beginning of the “Great Patriotic War”, in which the losses will be counted as “tens of thousands”.
The degree of adequacy of the head of the military department of Ukraine, who published the post on his page on Facebook, is an object for the study of specialists not in the military field," the Russian diplomats said in a statement.
They hardly believe that such statements may belong to the Minister of Defense of a civilized state.
On his Facebook page, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine wrote on Monday: “On unofficial channels, the Russian side has already threatened several times that if the resistance continues, they are ready to use tactical nuclear weapons against us.”
At the same time, he said that "the operation for the liberation of eastern Ukraine" has been completed.

Tony Stewart is in a car crash after returning to the track.
Tony Stewart’s return to the track ended just over halfway through the race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart crashed into the wall for the second time after his right front tire broke on the 172th lap, ending his performance.

Bulgaria's prison officials hold a national protest rally
Hundreds of prison officials from all over Bulgaria held a national protest in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital of the country, Sofia.
During the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands for the return of the former working conditions, which have recently been changed.
The increase in wages is also included in the list of requirements that will be discussed with the acting Minister of Justice Hristo Ivanov.
Within a month, officers expressed a symbolic protest against the new work schedule, demanding the return of the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite the fact that the prison workers’ union has met with representatives of the Ministry of Justice on several occasions, the agreement has not been reached, the Bulgarian National Radio (BNR) reports.
Negotiations are ongoing, the head of the Main Department for the execution of sanctions, Rosen Zeliazkov, said.

The army controls the new government of Thailand
General Prayut (right) appointed Minister of Defense Pravit Wongsuvana (left)
The military ruler and Prime Minister of Thailand, General Prayut Chan-Ocha, has announced the composition of the country’s new cabinet of ministers, in which more than a third of the posts are held by generals or retired generals.
Representatives of the army received key positions: Ministers of Defence, Finance, Foreign Affairs and Trade.
Prayut Chan-ocha was officially approved as prime minister on Monday after the king of Thailand officially approved the appointment of the interim military head of government to the post.
The 60-year-old military, who seized power in the country as a result of the bloodless coup on May 22, was the only candidate for prime minister.
He was elected Prime Minister at a parliamentary meeting.
Earlier, the army had appointed members of parliament.
According to Prayut Chan-Ocha, the coup was the only way to maintain stability.
It was preceded by six months of demonstrations in which protesters demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Yinglak Chinawat’s government.
Prayut Chan-Ocha will be the interim prime minister as the military plans to hold a general election in late 2015.
However, there are concerns that the military is trying to strengthen its power in the country.
The military came to power on May 22.
against the backdrop of complete paralysis of civil power.
The leaders of the main political parties have been provisionally arrested.
Immediately after the military came to power, they temporarily arrested the country’s leading politicians, including Prime Minister Yinglyk Chinawat.
Some journalists and public figures were also detained.
The current political crisis is rooted in 2006, when the army removed the Prime Minister of his brother Yinglyk Chinawat Taksin.
Both are popular with the rural population, especially in the northern parts of the country, which has ensured them success in elections.
However, many representatives of the middle class and the capital’s elite have entered an anti-government movement that has virtually paralyzed the country since November 2013.
No one ever said that clams would be better in the salad, I didn't promise you that, the waitress from the new Palm brasserie sucks.
It has to be formally admitted that this is indeed the case, but the mind and stomach remain inflexible.
After all, everyone knows for a long time: we say "Belgium" - we mean mussels, we say "mids" - we mean "Belgium".
Restaurants like to say deeply that the success of an establishment depends on three factors: this location, location and again location.
There are such places located not so good, but even excellent, but some unfortunate.
In short, sitting at the table of Palm, I remembered that there was once a cafe "City" (in honor of the same TV show), then "Odessa-mama", and also the restaurant "God" and beer "Friendship".
Now here again beer, but no longer nostalgic-Soviet, but Belgian.
Only the top of the iceberg lay above the ground: a bar counter and a couple of tables, all the rest of the space is devoid of even a hint of sunlight.
But here is fun, as in a children's room: red, yellow and green walls, multi-colored chairs, instead of windows - televisions where mermaid girls swim.
Belgian establishments in St. Petersburg have long not been new, so there is something to compare with.
There are eight types of pouring beer (260-300 rubles per 0.5 l) and an innumerable number of bottles (170-1550 rubles).
The company-positive waitress cheerfully presents the menu, telling that "the media is full of big seeds", and it should be noted: it is the service, despite some shortcomings, - the most positive side of Palm.
The menu is expected by content, but often very unexpected by performance.
Well, for example, it is possible to predict that a meat roll with a Walloon blackcurrant (280 rubles) - in fact a carpaccio, cut in addition so thin that parchment paper in comparison with it will seem ugly thick matter.
You can feel at least some taste, only if you crumble together the halves.
Salads are even worse.
The classic Li<0xC3><0xA8>ge (260) would be most correct to admit a crime against the Belgian people: some crumpled iceberg, boiled once a long time ago potatoes, splattered Kenyan beans, ripe chips made of bacon plus some marinated why.
With a salad like this, you won't want to meet anyone!
The composition of the ingredients of the Belgian salad was partly different, but the impression was also not positive.
If you could still close your eyes to the immature quarters of cherry tomatoes or overcooked champignons, why do mussels look as if they have been thawed and boiled several times in their lifetime!
After all, I already know: there are quite normal white sea mussels here!
They are served in pots "in sauce of your choice" (490-560 rubles for 0.5 kg).
Half a dozen sauces, the one made of white wine, celery and carrots, frankly did not give up.
Vegetables are there, and the aroma is absent, and whether there was wine, so remained a mystery.
But good reliant on mussels fries with homemade mayonnaise.
Chicken watercress here is not a loaf, thick to the extent that depending on the mood you can decide, the first or second dish in front of you, and just a nice creamy soup.
It was said that the rabbit was cooked by a local cook in beer sauce, and nothing was said about rosemary.
On the check, the situation turned out to be diametrically opposite: rosemary drowned everything.
There was an impression that this rabbit was fed exclusively rosemary bushes during his life, which is why the meat acquired such an unusual aroma.
But at the same time, the rabbit's leg was attached to a wonderful - no, just a magnificent pear in a caramelized crust.
Waffles in Palm offer not only sweet, but also rich - with beef, chicken or bacon and cheese (220-280).
The maple sauce turned out to be too watery, and the waffles are dry.
But the manager who came to the table was very informally interested in dinner impressions.
So it's worth coming back.
The dollar rose above the IMF's 37 rubles on news of the West's preparations for new sanctions against Russia.
This is a new historical record.
The dollar "tomorrow" at 10:29 MSK rose by 26.9 kopecks and amounted to 37.02 rubles, the euro exchange rate rose by 30 kopecks - up to 48.73 rubles, according to the data of the Moscow Stock Exchange.
The currency basket grew by 28 kopecks to the level of the previous closing and cost 42.28 rubles.
Before the Crimean events, the dollar reached a maximum on February 19, 2009 - then it cost 36.43 rubles, and on March 3, 2014 it was already 37,005 rubles.
On the night of August 29, the White House said that U.S. President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were discussing the possibility of imposing additional sanctions against Russia.
The weakening of the ruble is of a long-term nature, both in pairs with the euro and in pairs with the dollar.
The long-term forecast assumed this mark, - says senior analyst of "Alpari" Anna Bodrova.
Everything that has to do with Ukraine will somehow be reflected in the courses.
As long as this continues, investors will react.
Today, rumors about the invasion of troops have not been confirmed by either side, but the market has proved very emotional.
All conversations about him being resistant to such news were overshadowed yesterday.
The week, according to the expert, will close near these levels - 36.90 and 37.05 rubles per dollar.
The tax period is over, oil prices are weak, politics, sanctions, the problem of gas transit through Ukraine - all these are links of one chain.
Inflation is also expected to accelerate: the current prices for the autumn will be increased from 5 to 10%.
Soon, in addition, seasonal vegetables and fruits will end, and there will be some vacuum while the networks are redirected to other suppliers.
"The dollar approached the mark of 37 rubles, passed it and came back, there is no strong hysteria," commented Konstantin Bushuev, head of the market analysis department of the Discovery Broker.
They will still see if they will impose the promised sanctions on Saturday, as NATO will meet.
According to him, the ruble sharply weakened after the end of the tax season, then sent news about Ukraine, in addition, the Central Bank last week said that until the end of the year it is completely moving to the floating rate and abandoning any currency interventions.
If you look at the daily fluctuation, it was no different from the previous during this month, everyone was frightened by the mark of 37 rubles, - continues the analyst.
So, in terms of turnover, nothing powerful happened.
The troubled times for the currency market were, I recall, when there was increased demand for the currency at the end of January, and also on March 3, when the Central Bank sent a record amount of currency.
In UFS IC see the positive side of the weakening of the ruble.
First of all, it is an increase in the revenue part of the budget from export operations, as well as an increase in the competitiveness of domestic producers due to the increase in imports, says Alexey Kozlov, chief analyst at UFS IC.
Negative points can be attributed to the increase in the price of imported goods and services.
The sharp fluctuations of the Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of investment in the Russian economy, provoke the growth of inflationary pressure and, as a consequence, become the cause of the increase in the cost of borrowing money, which, in turn, hampers the development of the country's economy.
If we talk about the stock market, the depreciation of the ruble somewhat smooths the decline in stock prices, expressed in rubles.
For example, the MMVB Index fell by 1.67% during Thursday’s trading, and the RTS Index lost 3.27%.
Such a significant difference in the relative value of the decline in indices is due to the weakening of the ruble during the day by more than 1.5%.
The weakening of the ruble is emotional in nature and is explained by the massive desire to buy currency.
As practice shows, emotions gradually go to zero, and ruble quotes partially or completely restore lost positions.
"We believe that we will soon be able to see the ratio of the dollar to the Russian currency near the level of 36 rubles per dollar," Kozlov said.
A genetic disorder is often misdiagnosed.
The British woman said she had spent many years thinking she was going to die after being misdiagnosed.
Karin Rogers spent most of her teenage years thinking that she had only a few years to live after she was diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she had Sharko-Marie-Tuta disease (SMT), a group of hereditary disorders that lead to nerve damage outside the brain and spine.
The charity CMT UK reported that misdiagnosis is a common problem among people with STIs because so little is known about this condition.
About 23,000 people in the UK are presumed to have SMT, which can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, insecure walking, and clenched toes.
Patients may experience numbness or pain, and the condition does not heal and progresses, which means that symptoms worsen over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought she was suffering from Friedrich's (AF) ataxia - a condition for which the prognosis was very poor.
Rogers thought she would be confined to a wheelchair by the time she was 18 and would die before she turned 30.
The mother of two children, now 51, said: “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do what others could.
I fell every day, and it took me more time.
I’ve never been able to ride roller skates or skateboard with other kids, and I had to be bullied a lot in school because of the way I walked and ran.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after several surgeries to release the Achilles tendon and straighten the feet, she looked into the medical record when her doctor came out of the room, and it was written that she had AF.
"I felt guilty because I put my nose where it should not be, and so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, found information about this condition in the library and wrote to the AF Association," she said.
When I received the information in response, I was shocked and experienced the most horrific panic possible.
I thought I would be in a wheelchair at 18 and die before I turned 25, and that I would gradually lose all my abilities in that interval.
I went through this alone, and I planned my own funeral.
She said that by the time she turned 17, she realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she thought, and asked her doctor about it.
He just stood up, hugged me and said, "My dear, I don't think you have this disease, because you'd already be in a wheelchair."
I think you have something that poses a much lesser threat to life.
After several genetic tests, she was found to have SMT.
“When he explained what SMT was, I thought I pulled out a lucky ticket,” she said.
The UK charity SMT has announced a month of information about SMT to try to draw attention to the disease.
The tax burden on entrepreneurs in the Washington zone increases as the economy recovers
A recovering economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax bills for companies across the country rose moderately last year, as economic recovery accelerated, according to a new study published last week, and companies in the Washington area are no exception.
Companies in County, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $27.6 billion into the state and local treasury in fiscal 2013, up 3.8 percent from the $26.6 billion raised in 2012.
The tax burden on state and local businesses increased by 4.3 percent last year to $671 billion, up from 3.9 percent a year earlier, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after consecutive years when accounts declined in 2009 and 2010.
Taxes levied by the state rose 4.3 percent faster than local taxes, 3.9 percent, according to a study conducted by professional services firm Ernst & Young and the State Taxation Center, a tax policy group.
More than half of the county’s tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from taxes on entrepreneurs, while 36 percent of Maryland’s tax revenue comes from firms.
Virginia, with 28 percent, brings the lowest amount of tax revenue, proportionally, from entrepreneurs.
In large part, tax revenue growth is driven by a return to the company’s previous property value level, researchers say, raising property taxes by 3.7 percent this year after three years in a row, when the growth was less than 1 percent.
While a large proportion of these revenues come from large states such as California, New York, and Texas, the same seems to be happening in the Washington area.
Companies in County, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, $9.6 billion more than in 2012, up 4.2 percent from the previous year.
However, the observed return on real estate has no similar effect on growth in state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where real estate taxes barely exceed one-fifth of the company’s tax bills.
Companies in Virginia and the District of Columbia pay about half of the state and local tax bills in the form of property taxes.
“What’s happening in Maryland is that so much of their real estate, especially the tax base around the District of Columbia, belongs to either the government or a nonprofit that doesn’t pay real estate taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center for Taxation.
Thus, Maryland is forced to rely much more, for example, on income taxes to pay for the same services that exist in other states.
The recent increase in tax revenues from entrepreneurs cannot be fully explained by the restoration of the real estate market.
Entrepreneurs’ earnings also appear to be changing, according to this data.
Companies in the region have declared a state-wide corporate income tax of $2.3 billion, up $2.1 billion from 2012.
Maryland has raised $1 billion in corporate income tax revenue, the largest in the region.
Although the trends are in the same direction, the tax burden on entrepreneurs at the local level is not increasing at the same rate in all three areas.
The growth rate in the District of Columbia was at the same level as the country’s average, 4.3 percent, while growth in Maryland was significantly faster, 4.9 percent.
In Virginia alone, tax revenues rose below the average of 4.1 percent.
Virginia had the lowest corporate income tax in three jurisdictions (each with the same corporate rate), equal to 6 percent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 percent, while in the county it is relatively high - 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year found that Virginia has lower taxes on state- and local-level entrepreneurs and, overall, a more favorable tax climate for entrepreneurs than Maryland.
The county was not evaluated in this study.
Despite its advantage, Virginia is experiencing competitive pressure from its southern neighbor.
North Carolina recently signed legislation lowering the corporate rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, just like in Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to meet tax revenue targets next year, this law could bring the income tax rate for entrepreneurs up to 3 percent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington area seem to feel better and thus pay more state and local taxes, according to a recent study.
Taxes for entrepreneurs, paid in the form of an individual income tax by small business owners - a transitional structure on which the majority of small firms are organized - in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia grew by 20 percent to a rate of $2.4 billion last year.
The researchers say the trend and increase in business tax revenue across the country is likely to continue this year, with revenues from state and local income taxes rising 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
However, the Washington zone may be lagging behind, as a reduction in federal spending affects the labor market in the region.
The Bronze Age of Russian Judo
The domestic judo world championship brought the Russian national team two silver and seven bronze awards.
According to this indicator, the Russians gave way only to the main favorite of the competition - the national team of Japan.
The tournament in Chelyabinsk started on Monday, and the first day brought the Russian team a silver medal.
Its owner was Beslan Mudranov, who competed in the category up to 60 kg.
At the same time, in the same final fight with Boldbaatar Ganbat from Mongolia, the outcome of the confrontation resolved only one observation received by the Russian.
But the second day of the tournament was the most successful for the Russian national team - on Tuesday, three medals were won.
In men's competitions in the category up to 66 kg silver was awarded to Mikhail Pulyayev, and bronze - Kamala Khan-Magomedov.
In the final match, the Russian conceded to the world champion in 2011 and 2013 to the Japanese Masasi Ebinume.
Khan-Magomedov, who lost his compatriot in the quarter-finals, won the comforting tournament and became the bronze medalist.
In the women's tournament category up to 52 kg also to the third step of the pedestal of honor reached Natalia Kuzyutina.
In the semi-final, she lost to current world champion Milenda Kelmendi from Kosovo, who competed at this championship under the flag of the International Judo Federation and successfully defended the title.
In the bronze contest Kuzutina won by Ma Inan from China, but after the end of the tournament still admitted that the third place is not what she was counting on.
And again, the barrier on the Russian woman’s path to gold was Kelmendi, who defeated Kuzyutina earlier in the final of the European Championship.
On the third day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk bronze in the hoist of the national team of Russia put Musa Mogushkov, who fought in the category up to 73 kg.
In the quarterfinals, former representative of Moldova Viktor Skovortsov became his offender, now playing for the UAE team.
However, then the Russian won two fights and became the winner of the award.
Mogushkov performed at the home championship with an ankle injury, which he plans to cure in the near future, so he will take a break in the competitions.
As for ex-Moldovan Skvortsov, he and he reached the bronze medal in this tournament.
Interestingly, his other compatriot, who accepted UAE sports citizenship, Ivan Remarenko, finished the performance in the category up to 100 kg with bronze.
The fourth day of the World Cup 2014 also brought to the Russians one bronze, which in the category up to 81 kg was won by Ivan Nifontov.
In a heavy battle of the small final, he at the expense of the opponent's remarks defeated the Frenchman Alan Schmitt.
On Friday, three sets of prizes were played at the tournament, but the Russians traditionally limited themselves to one bronze in the men's tournament to 90 kg.
Its owner was Kirill Questions, and the national team of Russia this medal was guaranteed: his rival in the comforting final was compatriot Kirill Denisov.
However, the fight itself did not take place: the rival Question could not get out on Tatami due to injury.
The men's bronze was won by the hosts and on the sixth day of the competition - it was placed in the basket of the national team by Renat Saidov, who competed in the category of more than 100 kg.
In the comforting final, he won a clear victory over Brazilian David Mouray.
Thus ended the individual part of the world championship.
On the last day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, on Sunday, the titles of world champions in team competitions were played.
Both Russian national teams - both men's and women's - were among the main contenders for the awards, but, as in individual competitions, representatives of the fair sex were not lucky - they did not reach the medal.
But the Russian judoists won the team silver.
In a decisive confrontation, in a persistent struggle with the score of 2-3, they gave way to the main favorites of the competition - the team of Japan.
At the same time, the Russian team led 2-0 after the clean victory of Khan-Magomedov and Denis Yartsev (weight up to 73 kg).
However, in the heavier weight categories with their Japanese rivals could not cope Murat Khabachirov (81), Magomed Magomedov (90) and Aslan Kambiev (100).
According to the same scenario, the bronze match in the women's tournament, where the Russian team, leading 2-0, was inferior to the Japanese - 2-3.
The team competitions in Chelyabinsk were attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who after the end of the tournament congratulated the men's team with silver.
"Second place is very honorable, but I want to say that it was obvious that you could have become champions," Putin said, quoted by RIA Novosti.
To lose to the Japanese, the ancestors of judo - there is nothing shameful here.
But I'm sure you can win with them.
The Russian national team at the home world championship performed much better than a year ago in competitions of this level, held in Rio de Janeiro.
At that time, the Russian team had only three medals - one silver and two bronzes.
At the same time, the current tournament was missed by Olympic champions Arsen Galstyan and Mansour Isaev.
Of course, we are all great maximists.
I want gold medals.
But let’s remember that if a person in the Olympic cycle is one of the eight strongest, then he is a potential winner of the Olympics.
Especially in such a form of sport as judo," - summed up the results of the tournament Minister of Sport of the Russian Federation Vitaly Mutko, whose words are quoted by the press service of the championship.
The Japanese national team is expected to be the best in Chelyabinsk, winning 11 medals of various dignity, five of which turned out to be gold.
The next World Cup will be held next summer in Astana.

The Joan Rivers family hopes for the best
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since arriving at the hospital in New York three days ago, but her daughter expressed hope today that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from the disease.
“Thank you for your continued love and support,” Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency call about her having a cardiac arrest at a clinic in the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, sources say.
Doctors deliberately keep her under narcotics and under close surveillance until they are satisfied with her condition, which remains “heavy.”
The response was broad, including numerous online support from such as Donald Trump, Montell Williams, and Kelly Ripa.
Everyone will be able to make kings.
On sale, the band's debut album Royal Blood is a new hope of British rock, which brought the rock duos from the clubs directly to the stadiums.
The duo Royal Blood has only been on stage for a year, but already has an active nomination for the BBC Music Award, a warm-up tour with Arctic Monkeys and a visit to the makeup artist of the New York concert by Jimmy Page himself.
Their debut album of the same name received 100,000 pre-orders a few months before its release, and the contract for its release lies in the portfolio of major label Warner Music.
Given the current pitiful situation in the music market, the situation is out of the way, because we are not talking about the new Lana Del Rey or another sweet-haired representative of the "new R'n'B", but about a duo of bullfighters in the form of the last pair of Brits playing with that level of volume and ink.
In general, the bets on the first album due to all the above circumstances were particularly high and have already been fully justified.
The duo did not in vain take a name that could have been used before, except that the desperate hairy metallers, and the blood of which kings flowed, it seems to them, in their veins, is also clear.
It is, of course, primarily about the heroes of the past level Led Zeppelin: like the great quartet, Royal Blood set their goal to shake the stagnant blood of British rock, bringing it to a new height.
To make predictions about the success of this enterprise is still early, but something can already be said.
A dozen songs set in thirty minutes is not so much a demonstration of a phenomenal composer’s gift as a confident and powerful declaration of intent.
Some of the merits of individual numbers, of course, can not be denied: say, the pilot single "Out Of The Black" is characterized by what is remembered not by a melodic line, but by a drum party.
Musicians joke that this song is easier to play than to sing.
It is also worth highlighting the powerful "Little Monster" and the closing track "Better Strangers" with a Shakespearean quote in the title.
However, the truth is that each of these songs will sound great at a party for heavy rock lovers, but when played in a row, they merge into a more or less homogeneous canvas.
And it's not necessarily bad, even vice versa.
The strength of Royal Blood is that they do not claim the laurels of the new Lennons and McCartneys (rather to be the successors of Motörhead), but have brought numerous rock duets from ghetto indie clubs.
Their music, despite some variety, is created for stadiums, in an area designed for less than a couple of thousand people, she is obviously close.
The secret is partly in the clever use of the bass, which replaced the guitar in the usual format invented at the beginning of The White Stripes.
However, it is not only about the instruments, but also about the approach to writing songs.
Heroes of retro-rock zeros were difficult to choose outside the postmodern paradigm, with great reluctance to go on to recognize themselves not just epigones, but independent creative units.
Royal Blood already sound so powerful and brazen that this pressure successfully draped some secondaryness and solidity of the music material.
After all, who said rock should be smart?
Amazon Buys Twitch for $1.04 Billion
AMAZON just confirmed what Information reported on Friday morning: The online store — and video producer, and hundreds of other things — is buying Twitch’s streaming video playback service for $1.04 billion ($US970 million).
This news came as a surprise not because no one expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be a buyer.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitch to Google's video service for a good billion looked completely ready, and this combination seemed natural.
Twitch, founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, has set itself the goal of being a streaming service of a general nature – a real-time version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly turned into a platform where gamers broadcast their in-game moments; “YouTube for real-time gaming,” according to Business Insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a genre of videos in which omniscients give (mainly old) games processing, as in "Mystery Theatre", are already popular on YouTube.
The fact is that YouTube is often mentioned when describing Twitch, so the news that YouTube is acquiring Twitch was met with little interest, a classic example of a rooted technology company buying out a potential competitor.
It’s a secret why the deal with YouTube failed, given that it was reportedly willing to pay no less than Amazon.
Emmett Shira, CEO of Twitch, said: “We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us achieve them faster.”
Another secret, to be honest, is the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who claim to be better at sports than watching it, it’s hard to understand the appeal of watching games instead of taking the joystick in their own hands.
It’s one thing to look over a friend’s shoulder at 3 a.m. as she crawls through Resident Evil, and it’s another thing to watch an outsider get 20 shots in the head in a row in Call of Duty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of today’s most popular games are designed for one person, so watching them shoot without controlling the angle of view on your own can be a headache recipe worthy of Do It Right.
I agree that the high-speed passes in which the Rogers Bannisters of our electronic age complete entire games in record time are entertaining.
But if it’s not about game virtuoso or humor, it’s unlikely that his Twitch channel will be interesting at all.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors per month, and it is the fourth largest source of peak internet traffic.
How exactly will Amazon do this?
It’s hard to imagine that Twitch will roll into Amazon Instant Video as gracefully as YouTube could just swallow Twitch.
However, Twitch has something that any company would be happy to receive: the crowds of young men that advertisers dream of.
As the head of Twitch Shire said, Amazon and Twitch “both believe in the future of games,” and this channel does not show signs of decline, even — oh — as a spectacular sport.
As a result of the 2004 terrorist attack, more than 330 people were killed, including 186 children.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
We spoke with the survivors of hostages - almost all now students, with the parents of the dead, with the guardian of the cemetery - City of Angels - Ramon Kaspolatov, head of the committee "Mothers of Beslan" Susanna Dudieva, who took part in the special operation of the staff of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
Having returned to Moscow, they met with Aslambek Aslakhanov, who 10 years ago was an adviser to the President on the North Caucasus and held talks with terrorists, as well as with the FSB's V-Officer Vyacheslav Bocharov.
What particularly shocked me during my time working on this topic is the fact that in Beslan it was as if these ten years were not there.
This topic is extremely painful for anyone who has anything to do with it, people hardly agree to talk about what happened.
The impressions from the trip are very difficult.
But we cannot forget Beslan, and I hope that we have done our job," Antonova said.
The special project was prepared by the infographics studio of the Rambler & Co holding, which has been working at the company since the spring of this year.
Previous special projects were dedicated to the First World War and the 15th anniversary of Vladimir Putin’s stay in power.
DPRK launches short-range missile
North Korea has launched a short-range missile into the waters of the Japanese Sea, reports "Renhap".
The launch was made around 10.30 a.m. local time from Chagando province, which is on the border of North Korea and China.
The missile reportedly landed in the Sea of Japan, flying about 220 km, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said.
Deputies proposed to speed up the entry into force of the law on personal data
In case of success of the initiative, data of Russians will not be stored on servers abroad from January 1, 2015
The State Duma has submitted a draft law, which provides for the transfer of the date of entry into force of the already adopted law on personal data of Russians - from September 1, 2016 to January 1, 2015.
The initiative is placed in the base of legislative activity of the lower house.
Its authors were the deputies of the State Duma Vadim Dengin, Yaroslav Nilov (LDPR), Yevgeny Fedorov ("United Russia"), Vladimir Parahin ("Fair Russia") and Alexander Yushchenko (KPRF).
Such a change, according to the authors of the initiative, will contribute to a more rapid and effective provision of the rights of citizens of the Russian Federation to the protection of personal data and observance of the secrecy of correspondence in information and telecommunications networks.
The law, which enters into force in a hurry parliamentarians, obliges to store on the territory of the Russian Federation personal data of Russians, processed through the Internet.
It also makes it mandatory to record, systematize, accumulate, store, clarify and extract personal data of Russian citizens in databases located on the territory of Russia, as well as to indicate the location of such databases.
In addition, the law grants Roskomnadzor the right on the basis of a court decision to restrict access to information processed in violation of Russian legislation in the field of personal data.
The law also proposes the creation of so-called "blacklists" of violating websites - the automated information system "Register of violators of the rights of personal data subjects".
This law was adopted by the State Duma in the summer.
The authors of the bill were Andrei Lugova and Vadim Dengin from the LDPR and Alexander Yushchenko from the KPRF.
Dengin and Yushchenko are also among the authors of the current bill on the transfer of the date of entry into force of the already adopted law.
Those who do not have data centers in Russia will have to pay for rent
Commenting on the draft law submitted to the State Duma today, the first deputy head of the Duma Committee on Information Policy, Leonid Levin, said that he saw no problems with the transfer of the date of entry into force of the law on the protection of personal data.
According to him, those companies that by January 1, 2015 will not have their own personal data repositories of Russians on the territory of the Russian Federation, will be able to rent them, for example, "Rostelecom", which has repeatedly said that they are ready to provide their servers for rent and already provides their servers, Mail Group, behind the computer
“In addition, there are several independent data centers ready to cooperate in this area,” he added.
"If companies decide to comply with the law and continue to work on the territory of the Russian Federation, I do not see any problems - they will be given technological opportunities for placement," Levin summed up.
The Controversial Bill
Immediately after the publication of the draft law, the Russian Electronic Communications Association expressed concern that if the bill was passed, Russians would no longer be able to use many global Internet services.
In particular, we are talking about online booking services of airline tickets and hotels.
According to the association, "the draft law deprives subjects of personal data - citizens of the Russian Federation the right to dispose of their own data imperatively determining that their recording, systematization, etc. should be provided only in databases located on the territory of the Russian Federation".
The RAEC statement emphasizes that a more effective measure would be to establish a mechanism to inform the user of where the recording is being made, to systematize his personal data.
In this case, he will be able to choose in which territory these actions will be carried out.
The adoption of such bills on the "localization" of personal data in other countries has led to the decline of global services and significant economic losses.
A participant of the ice water bucket test deformed the jaw
Isabelle Roberts from the UK screamed so loudly when ice water was poured on her head that it damaged the bone structure of her face.
This test of ice water with a bucket went to the pain wrong.

The militias handed over to the Ukrainian military more than 400 prisoners
In the "Army of Novorussia" claim that shot down the Ukrainian Su-27, and accuse the enemy of violating the agreement on the ceasefire
As of 10:00 a.m. on September 1, the militia handed over to the Ukrainian side 402 prisoners, 72 of whom were wounded, as well as the bodies of 35 soldiers who died.
This was reported to "Interfax" by a representative of the press service of the "Army of Novorossiya".
He added that "aircraft forces in the vicinity of the village of Mereshki shot down a Su-27 aircraft, which violated the ceasefire agreements."
According to the interlocutor of the agency, the Ukrainian side used cluster munitions prohibited by international conventions in the case of artillery shelling of Luhansk airport.
A spokesman for the press service noted that the militias during the night managed to damage two helicopters of the Ukrainian Air Force at one of the field airfields, as well as destroy two armored personnel carriers and two ammunition depots.
"Losses in the enemy's live force - up to a hundred people killed and wounded, 13 people surrendered to captivity," - summarized the representative of the headquarters.
"Interfax" does not have confirmation of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, the armed formations of the "people's republics" of Donbass announced the transfer to the Ukrainian side as part of compliance with the ceasefire regime of 223 prisoners and soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine.
At the same time, at night, the army of the DPR, according to the "Army of Novorossiysk", "stopped the attempt of the National Guard in violation of the previously reached agreements to remove heavy equipment from the surrounding area".
At that time, the militia reported the destruction of two tanks and two BMPs in the short-lived battle, the seizure of six tanks and the disarmament of 198 soldiers.
According to the headquarters, the total losses of the enemy in all directions (Donetsk, Luhansk, Mariupol) during that night amounted to five tanks, eight armored fighting vehicles, more than 120 people killed and wounded.
At the end of last week, a large group of Ukrainian soldiers was surrounded by militias in the Ilovaysk area in the Donetsk region.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has asked the leadership of the “people’s republics” to release Ukrainian military personnel from the encirclement.
In the DPR agreed to go for this on the condition of handing over weapons and ammunition by the enemy.
The first dozen soldiers began to leave the encircled settlements on Saturday morning.
According to the commander of the encircled battalion of the Ukrainian territorial defense "Donbass" Semenen Semenchenko, on the night of Sunday, another 14 people came out of the "boiler".
In his Facebook, Semenchenko wrote that the Ukrainian wounded are "captured by 137 regiments of 32 Russian divisions and 9 Russian tank brigades", where they are treated well.
Meanwhile, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Defense denied reports by the Ukrainian military and NATO about the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
Russian Foreign Ministry: Russia will take retaliatory measures in case of imposition of new EU sanctions
Russia reserves the right to take retaliatory measures aimed at protecting its legitimate interests in the event of the imposition of new anti-Russian sanctions, the Russian Foreign Ministry said.
In a statement, the Russian Foreign Ministry said that the "conclusions" of the European Council of August 30 demonstrated the inability of EU member states to overcome the inertia of reckless support from the Kiev authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in eastern Ukraine, based on "absolutely unproven allegations of the presence of Russian armed forces on the territory of that country," the ministry's website said.
The Russian Foreign Ministry regrets that the European Council, contrary to the interests of its member states, is subject to the influence of countries that are interested in strengthening the confrontation with Russia.
The members of the European Council should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, as well as provide the conditions for a full "dialogue between the opposing parties," the ministry stressed.
It is also noted on the website of the ministry that there are currently no objective assessments of the humanitarian situation in the Donbas, where a full-scale humanitarian disaster has unfolded, and the number of victims among the civilian population is increasing.
We will remind that within the next seven days in the European Union it is planned to develop specific proposals on sanctions against the Russian Federation.
At the same time, EU representatives are working closely with American officials.
They are expected to correlate with each other in terms of duration and degree of stiffness.
The new EU sanctions could affect the energy and financial sector.
The Australian government also announced an extension of sanctions against Russia in the field of defense, finance and oil and gas industry.
Clever Ways to Save on University Tutorials
While the cost of university textbooks for many students exceeds $1000 a year, Matt Schroeder, who will soon move on to a second course, has come up with a tricky way to cut costs.
He developed a system of how to rent books from high school students, offering them a nominal compensation to postpone their sale.
“My textbook on mathematical analysis, which usually costs $180, I got for a semester for $10 and a chick-fil-A cookie,” says Schröder, 19, who is studying at Covenant College in Georgia.
The literature needed for last semester would cost $430, he says.
He spent $120.
According to the Board of Colleges, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and study supplies, but students have a number of options to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly choosing online stores and creative ideas, similar to the Schröder system.
Book rentals are becoming increasingly popular, allowing students to use the book for a semester, and often cost significantly less than buying them.
Nibo Incorporated, which owns more than 250 university bookstores, reports that book rentals have doubled since 2011.
Industry research shows that about a quarter of books in university bookstores were rented out during the past spring semester, says Nibo Vice President Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of all books are purchased in university bookstores, according to the National Association of University Stores.
Here is an introductory course on the best ways to make a profitable deal.
Buying in an online store
Sometimes, if you go online, the price of a new book can make up one-third of what you’ll see in a university bookstore.
The ninth edition of the Mathematical Analysis by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards, and Robert Hostetler costs about $290 at a price, but a new copy can be purchased for $239.99 at Chegg.com, which specializes in textbook sales.
Purchasing used
If you’re not against other people’s marks or damage, used textbooks are a good option.
"Mathematical Analysis" is sold for $93.49 in used form on Chegg.com.
Matt Cassadey, 25, a fourth-year student at Brigham Young University, says he paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used copy of the textbook “Strategic Solutions in Media: Understanding the Business Side of Advertising Business.”
The book was sold for $48.
Teachers such as Ingrid Bracy, director of the College Without Walls at the University of Massachusetts at Emherst, are asking students to ask their professors if they can use the previous editions.
Sometimes updates are not essential for classes.
In such cases, old editions can often be found for a very small share of the cost of the last edition.
In addition to the Chegg and Amazon sites, Half.com, owned by “eBay Inc.”, is a popular alternative to buying used books.
Renting
About taking the textbooks for rent, it is worth thinking, if you are good enough to deal with them, do not forget to return them and do not want to leave them to yourself after the course is finished.
You can save more than 80% of the cost of a new book.
For example, one student was able to rent "Mathematical Analysis" for a semester for about $20.
Find out the rules of the store where you pick up the books, including any fines you may be fined for marks, highlights, and damages.
If you rent a book, remember: if you do not return the book, the fines may even exceed the cost of a new copy.
E-Books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are another option.
Sometimes such books are actually rented out, acquiring an electronic license for a certain period of time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
The rental of "Mathematical Analysis" on Chegg.com for six months will cost about $61.
Bracy says that students studying literature can often find the best prices, as many classic works can now be downloaded for free, while literature on natural and engineering sciences can be quite expensive.
Whatever it is, check it out.
Joe Galt, 29, who is going to start studying at Pepperdine Law School, recommends using the ISBN number to find out the price of a book, as this ensures that you are looking for exactly the text you need.
Before ordering online, says Golt, be sure to check if the book is actually in stock.
This lesson was not easy for him.
The delivery of the book he purchased was postponed for four weeks, and, in the end, he paid the full price at the university bookstore.
Putin says inefficiency of the development fund of the Far East
Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared at a meeting on state support for priority investment projects and territories in the Far East that the budget investment fund for the development of the Far East, created two years ago, is ineffective, Interfax reports.
“15 billion rubles remained on deposits,” the president stressed.
During the meeting, the head of state instructed to speed up the approval of the list of territories of advanced development in the Far East.
He recalled that the draft law necessary for the creation of TORs should be submitted to the State Duma this autumn.
The Federal Assembly, the president noted, did not approve the list of territories of advanced development in the Far East, and their criteria, until July 1.
Vladimir Putin also formulated the main objectives for the development of the Far East.
Among them, increasing transport accessibility of the region, removing infrastructure restrictions - both in the domestic market and for the development of exports.
Among other things, it is necessary to create prerequisites for attracting additional investments to the region, as well as to form territories of advanced development, which should become competitive in relation to the key business centers of the ATR, the President stressed.
Recall, it was previously reported that the territory of advanced development can replace the EEZ.
Why “Guardians of the Galaxy” Couldn’t Save the Cashier’s Fees
Sylvester Stallone’s “Unstoppable 3” returned less than $30 million from her $90 million budget in the U.S., while “City of Sins: A Woman Worth Killing” returned only $12 million from her $70 million budget.
Cameron Diaz's "Home Video" brought in just $14.6 million over the first weekend, while children's movies like "How to Train the Dragon 2" also disappoint revenue.
The Telegraph article by Robbie Collin points out that when it comes to children's films, it may be a poor quality of the films themselves.
Collins called 2014 the "worst" year in history in terms of children's movies, and called "How to Train the Dragon 2" a barely "functioning" continuation of fantasy.
However, when it comes to films aimed at a slightly older audience, it seems that the problem does not necessarily lie in the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic ratings of each film released in the summer in the amount of at least 2,000 copies between the Memorial Day holiday in May and July 20, for 2013 and for that year.
The results, which take into account the opinion of both film viewers and film critics, suggest that this year’s film harvest is similar in caliber to last year’s hits.
Some commentators suggest that the issue may be in the changing viewing habits and growing popularity of streaming online services such as Netflix.
Director John Favreau, who is currently working on the upcoming Disney movie The Jungle Book, told the Hollywood Reporter website: “I think times are changing.”
We must acknowledge this and not try to chase after what was before.
Unlike the current drop in Hollywood cash charges, Netflix’s revenue from streaming service reached $1.2 billion, almost doubling last year’s figure of $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studios for relying too much on comic book franchises, and predicted the “collapse” of Hollywood.
In light of the current downturn, some commentators claim that there was a share of truth in his bleak predictions.
Due to the fact that several potential box office hits are expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Altron, Minions and Jurassic Park, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic.
Producer Simon Kinberg recently called the drop in box office fees simply “cyclical,” telling the Hollywood Reporter: “Next summer will be the most box office summer in history, and no one will worry about it.”
Food sanctions do not scare the owners of establishments with Caucasian and Central Asian food, but for restaurants of European and Japanese cuisine, Russian suppliers are a terrible dream.
And in general, the general public still prefers to replace the prohibited imports with products not from Russia, but from Latin America, Israel and China.
“It’s better to eat low-salt cucumber than a bad mozzarella,” says Barlotti chef Mariano Valerio about the quality of the cheeses he is offered by suppliers in exchange for Italian ones.
The mozzarella and burrata cheese ended up in the restaurant first, they have a small shelf life.
Parmesan stock should be enough for another couple of months.
What to do?
Going to Russian?
In 2005, I was in the Dorogomilovskiy market.
Mariano Valerio makes such eyes that it is clear: the shocking memories do not let go of him yet.
The meat was lying on the wagons just 30 centimeters from the floor!
There are cats!
Rats!
Then I said that for our restaurant we will never buy anything in the Russian markets.
I don't know, maybe it's all changed now.
But the other day I was brought to the test fish from the Far East.
So she turned out to be stunned!
I said I didn't even want to talk to the person who brought it to us.
Valerio is surprised that many things usual for Italy for the Russian manufacturer in the wild.
A few years ago, I was forced to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, meat is hung in a refrigerator for 10 days at a temperature of 1-2 degrees.
It needs to be stretched to become soft so that the muscles relax.
I did all this with local beef.
Then they asked me, “Where did you get this tender meat?”
I said, it's yours, Russian!
Why doesn't anyone do that to you?
A five-minute walk from Barlotti in the French restaurant "Brasserie Bridge" in the kitchen hangs a stop-list, which indicates the missing products: French oysters, sea buckthorn.
The chef of the Brasserie Most restaurant and the Arrow bar Directed by Trigel is not as pessimistic as Valerio: oysters from France have already been replaced by oysters from Tunisia, and instead of French cheeses, the restaurant will buy Swiss.
However, Rezis becomes more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: "Colored cabbage - 200 rubles!
I ask, "Why, on what basis is it worth so much?"
They say, "Well, we have to make money, too."
But this cabbage should not cost more than 80 rubles!
Far Eastern oysters we buy by weight, but they live for 15-20 years, do you know how much their shell weighs?
At the price it turns out to be a super delicacy.
It seems that Russian suppliers are one of the main sources of scares for foreign chefs.
The standard story: "The first three months everything was fine, then the quality fell sharply."
The main claims: Russian suppliers cannot withstand stable caliber and quality.
Many European restaurants don’t know what will happen to them when they run out of cheese.

Sanctions menu
On August 6, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of certain economic measures to ensure the security of Russia, which are called mainly food sanctions.
It is forbidden to import beef, pork, meat and poultry by-products, meat delicacies, fish, shellfish, milk, yogurt, cheese, cheese, vegetables, fruits, nuts, sausages and sugar syrups.
Restaurants have started a charade with suppliers: prices for products have risen, you need to urgently look for analogues from other countries.
Most of all, this will affect the expensive restaurants with the monocoque of France, Italy, Spain, to which the products were delivered directly from the "mother" countries.
The community had to be restructured before.
For example, in early 2014, the Rosselkhoznadzor banned the import of Australian beef, and the year before - American and Canadian meat.
In return, suppliers set up beef deliveries from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But the sanctions of the summer of 2014 turned out to be much more serious.
However, on August 20, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree, which remove from the ban malts Atlantic salmon and trout, lactose-free milk, seed potatoes, sugar corn, peas and onions for sowing.
Valerio hopes that the sanctions could be eased further.
At the moment, some restaurants are in a state of uncertainty.
According to the company "East-West", one of the largest suppliers of HoReCa, the share of imported products in the premium segment was up to 70%.
“The expensive restaurants will have to change the menu to what local farmers and other countries produce,” says Sergey Mironov, a restaurant owner at Restconsult.
If the chef is strong, it will not be a problem for him.
Only we have very few such chefs, and it may take two or three months to develop a new menu.
Trigel from the restaurant "Brasserie Most" is ready for this: you will have to give up 10-15% of the dishes, another half of the menu - rework.
In restaurants with mixed cuisine, dishes such as steak made from marble beef are already being replaced by beef sturgeon, says Sergey Mironov.
"Cheese from Europe can be replaced with Russian, Belarusian cheeses, cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile," said Oksana Glibchuk, a representative of East-West.
Creams and dairy products from Europe have analogues in Russia and Belarus.
Chicken from the US can be replaced with chicken from Russia and Belarus, salmon and semolina from Norway - salmon, semolina, trout from Belarus and Chile.
The lack of vegetables and fruits of European production can be compensated by the products of domestic producers, offers from Serbia, Moldova and China.
According to Mironov, budget network restaurants will be easier to restructure than the premium segment: it is unlikely that there were gourmets able to distinguish Italian mozzarella from Russian.
Although it will be difficult for the institutions of the Ginza Project, he believes.
The Ginza Project has several dozen restaurants under different brands and with their own menus.
It will take a lot of time to replace it," Mironov said.
Ginza declined to comment, citing the lack of owners in the country.
The owners of the café of Caucasian and Central Asian cuisine emphasize that the products from the former Soviet republics are more fragrant than the European ones.
But there are many restaurants, which sanctions almost do not affect.
These include establishments with the cuisine of the CIS countries: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
“There is no expensive food in Georgian cuisine,” says Hutuna Kolbaya, owner of the Georgian restaurant Saperavi and the “Wai ma!” cafe.
All cheeses for us are made in Russia, based on many dishes - chicken fillet, exotic greens we do not use. "
In the restaurants of Kolbay have not yet removed any dishes from the menu.
Timur Lansky, the owner of restaurants "Chaihona N1" with Uzbek cuisine, the sanctions are also not embarrassed: he will only have to change lamb to New Zealand.
If Russia sets up imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we will even gain in price, for us it will be cheaper than imports from Europe, - he says.
From the CIS you can get cheaper cuts, lamb, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruits.
At the same time, what is brought from Central Asia is much better than "plastic" from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
About Uzbek tomatoes everyone knows that they are delicious, sweet.
No one speaks Spanish like that.
After the imposition of sanctions, the representative of the Ministry of Agriculture of Uzbekistan Olimby Artykov said that he plans to increase the export of fruit products to Russia by half by 2016.
Belarus and Kazakhstan have announced their intention to replace European imports into Russia almost immediately after the imposition of sanctions.
Fast food restaurants, which responded to the request of "Deneg", also quite calmly respond to the sanctions.
The McDonald’s press service said that the localization exceeds 85% and the network works with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatyana Bogdanova, head of the Subway Russia supplier department, about 80% of the network purchases in Russia, although there may be temporary difficulties with the supply of vegetables and rising prices for meat products that are produced from imported raw materials.
In "Teremka" "sanctioned products" occupied not more than 4% in general.
Didn't touch the sanctions and the Walker noodle.
KFC, Burger King, and Potato Bite did not respond to Money’s request, but other market participants argue that Burger King’s localization rate is significantly lower than McDonald’s.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, restaurateurs are ready to buy Chilean rather than Russian Far Eastern
On his hill
Meanwhile, the restaurateurs are complaining that due to the increase in demand, prices are rising even for local products.
"For products for "Grabley" prices increased on average by 10-15%, for the Italian restaurant "Cherry Mio" - twice", - says the restaurant manager Roman Rozhnikovsky.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the cost of dishes will increase by 5-10%, admits Kolbaya.
East-West does not deny this: "For example, Belarusian dairy products have increased by 10-15% since the beginning of August."
"Brazilian suppliers have almost doubled the price of pork," said Sergey Rak, Stardogs' deputy general manager.
Chickens have increased by 35%.
We are waiting for prices from China, maybe they will cool the hot Brazilian heads.
In the near future, Stardogs will have a planned price increase of 8%.
Now it is very undesirable to raise prices, says Cancer.
According to statistics, the growth in general food revenue for the second quarter of 2014 is only 1.8%.
This is the lowest figure since 2010.
Retail prices will continue to rise, he admits, but it is unclear how fast: while most restaurateurs have stocked up on products for the next two months in the hope of anticipating divergences in purchasing prices.
But what will happen in two months, no one knows.
In the square in front of the Moscow City Hall stands a dozen tents decorated with greenery and wood.
In the middle of the stage, the musicians play the waltz.
This is a festival of regional products with the fun name "There is time there".
“We were going to do a celebration of local food for a long time, and here just sanctions, we hurried, organized a festival,” one of the organizers says.
Behind the stage with musicians, Greek chef Anastas cooks a salad of pasta and homemade sweets, the other day there was a master class on the preparation of borsch with caramelized apples.
All of the Russian products, the organizers say.
In the tents - an exhibition of achievements of the Russian economy.
Honey from Bashkiria, reindeer from Salehard, vegetables from the sub-Moscow "Sovkhoz named after Lenin", cheese from the downtrodden Italian Jay Clause.
"The salmon for restaurants can be safely replaced by another salmon-bred fish from the Far East," says Philip Galkin, owner of the fish shop "Your People."
We've got a kidney, a keto, a squirrel, a hump, a squid - the "royal salmon".
Yes, they are not as fatty as Norwegian salmon, because it is a wild fish.
Norwegian salmon is aquaculture.
You take him in your hand, he's not even moving.
And our far-eastern salmon you will not hold in your hands.
Only the institutions without special claims agree to replace the Italian mozzarella with the domestic one
In the window of his tent there are shrimp with the sign "Magadan", cod, omul, muksun, mussels from the Crimea, ridges from the Far East.
Galkin is sure that it is time to switch to fish from the Far East.
According to statistics, fishing in Russia in 2013 - more than 4 million tons, a significant part of the fish goes to Japan, Korea and even the United States.
Imports of fish in 2013 - about 800,000 tons.
The shop "Svoi people" has been operating since 2012, sells fish through the online store, before the imposition of sanctions served another one and a half dozen restaurants, for example, "Simple things".
Now, Galkin has received applications from another 15 restaurants.
The same sushi can be made from our fish, - he warms up.
We tried different recipes and tried different recipes.
Now we sell sushi through the online store for a million rubles a month.
Our fish is cheaper several times, and delivery is a maximum of 15 rubles per kilogram.
As a confirmation in Galkin's tent, I'm getting a portion of Philadelphia with ketchup.
Unlike rolls with semolina, these have to chew longer, but the awareness that this fish is ours, domestic, gives strength.
On the site of the shop "Your people" there are even rolls of coat and sea bass.
In sushi bars, however, replacing Norwegian salmon with Chilean salmon is preferred.
Galkin explains this by the fact that cooks are lazy to come up with new recipes with Far Eastern fish.
"Russian fish suppliers have not yet offered us", - explains the owner of Killfish Bar Dmitry Evseev.
About the same situation with other products: Russian manufacturers could occupy the liberated niche, but this does not happen.
According to the founder and co-owner of the LavkaLavka project, Boris Akimov, we can now talk more about replacing imports from Europe and America with imports from China, Israel and Latin America.
There are large transnational corporations, which have powerful logistics and large volumes.
They are able to quickly replace the banned imports, unlike our farmers.
That is, large producers of other countries will benefit from the ban in the first place," Akimov said.
However, in the last month, the restaurant industry has received a more alarming signal than food sanctions.
As a result of the mass unplanned inspections of Rospotrebnadzor, the activities of three McDonald's enterprises in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Yekaterinburg were temporarily suspended.
“We are studying the essence of the claims filed to determine the actions needed to quickly open restaurants for visitors,” the company said in a statement.
No one really knows what will happen next.
If everything is limited to food sanctions, this is one option that can be survived, - says on the condition of anonymity an employee of a company engaged in restaurant consulting.
If McDonald’s is shut down across the country, the scenario will be completely different.
"Europrotocol" instead of the GIBDD reference
Cash payments can be received without a reference to the GIBDD - so the Central Bank intends to stimulate the implementation in Russia of the "Europrotocol".
The Bank of Russia has developed a draft guidance according to which from September 1 of this year, an insured motorist will be able to get cash payments without a GIBDD certificate.
It is true that we are only talking about the cases where the accident was carried out according to the "Europrotocol" without the participation of the road police.
That is, if only two cars were involved in the accident, there are no physically injured persons, the damage does not exceed the established limit and both drivers have reached agreement on who is responsible for the accident.
From August 2, the limit of payments under the "Europrotocol" is 50 thousand rubles, and from October 1 in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in the Moscow and Leningrad regions, it will be increased to 400 thousand rubles.
The point is that often, even with minor injuries, in a situation where an accident can be arranged according to the "Europrotocol", drivers who got into an accident, cause an accident.
After all, in the presence of a casco policy, it was not possible to get compensation for it without a certificate of HIBDD.
The parameters prescribed in the draft guidelines are designed to eliminate this obstacle to the implementation of the "Europrotocol" in Russia.
According to them, the maximum payout for the casco in connection with the accident, made without the staff of the IBDD, should not be lower than the limit under the "Europrotocol".
But at the same time, it can not be higher than the limit specified in the Casco insurance contract.
The idea is certainly useful and theoretically capable of unloading both the employees of the DPS and the road.
But it is likely that neither motorists nor insurers will be delighted by it.
The latter are already talking about a serious threat of growing fraud, which may lead to the introduction of new rules for cash payments.
As for the drivers, it is difficult to imagine what work will have to be done to overcome the original Russian conservatism.
In most cases, the driver will wait for hours for the inspector to arrange a small accident, because it is more reliable.
And it is not yet known what will be easier - to defeat fraudsters or convince drivers of the reliability of the "Europrotocol".
Savings certificate will make the name and irrevocable
The Ministry of Finance wants to ban savings certificates on the originator, but will allow banks to make them an analogue of an irrevocable deposit.
The Ministry of Finance is preparing a bill that will ban savings certificates on the applicant.
Recently, this tool is gaining popularity, as the rates here are higher than for bank deposits.
The fact is that savings certificates for the depositor do not fall into the deposit insurance system, and they are cheaper for the bank, since there is no need to deduct funds from the Deposit Insurance Agency (DIA).
The spiciness of the situation is that this step is planned to be taken due to small and medium-sized banks distributing such certificates, and will suffer from it Sberbank and Bank of Moscow, which, according to ASV estimates, control 98% of the profile market.
And the share of the Bank of Moscow, according to the agency, is about 3.5%.
The problem, explained in the ASA, is that customers of a small bank who have purchased such a certificate, in case of withdrawal from it, the licenses try to get money in the ASA.
Some depositors, who do not have sufficient financial literacy and buy savings certificates for the depositor, may assume that their investments are insured.
The reasoned absence of insurance payments under these certificates in the case of withdrawal of the license from the bank can lead to misunderstanding and social tension.
In practice, there were cases when the holders of the presenting certificates tried to seek insurance reimbursement through the court," the ASV said.
The problem, of course, is imaginary.
After all, no one will pay the buyers of certificates anyway, because they have no right to compensation from the state.
If it were that the instrument is not insured in ASA, it would also prohibit metal bills, on which the funds of citizens are accounted in grams of one of the four metals - gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
After all, these accounts also do not fall into the deposit insurance system, but their existence is not yet attempted.
The fact is, most likely, that the certificates for the originator are a very convenient security, which can actually act as a quasi-deneger.
At the same time, their movement is almost uncontrollable: any customer of the bank can buy a certificate, transfer to any citizen, and before the liquidation of such a certificate can change many owners.
It is not by chance that the draft law stipulates that a savings certificate must necessarily be a named security, which must be stored in the depository.
And to sweeten the pill to banks, such certificates are allowed to be issued without the right of early repayment.
That is, an analogue of an irrevocable deposit is introduced, which bankers have long dreamed of.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
There were protests over the weekend by those who opposed the NATO summit in Newport.
Hundreds gathered in downtown Newport on Saturday to march against NATO.
And on Sunday in Cardiff, about 150 people gathered at the town hall of Cardiff for what was described as an anti-Sammite.
Stephen Fairclaw watched the events for us over the weekend and spoke with protesters who came from all over the world: from Bridgend to Belgium.
Germany to send 30 anti-tank systems to Iraq
Germany will supply weapons to Iraq to counter the militants from the terrorist group "Islamic State", reports on August 31 ITAR-TASS, citing the decision taken after the meeting of representatives of the German government led by Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Germany will reportedly send 30 Milan portable anti-tank missile systems and 500 charges to Iraq, as well as 8,000 G3 and G36 assault rifles.
The deliveries will be made by the end of September.
In addition, it was decided to allocate another <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 million to Iraq for humanitarian assistance.
On 1 September, Ms. Merkel will make a federal statement on the subject.
So far, Germany has not delivered its weapons to “hotspots”.
The views of the people of Germany on the sending of weapons to the Iraqis were divided.
Some believe that this is the only way to stop fighters from the Islamic State, others fear that this weapon may eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
Militants hit a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Sea of Azov
Donetsk militias have attacked a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Sea of Azov, ITAR-TASS reported on August 31.
According to available data, this occurred in Taganrog Bay near the settlements of Shirokino and Bezymennoe (10-20 km east of Mariupol).
A number of Ukrainian media reports about the shelling of two coast guard boats.
It is specified that the incident occurred today around 16:20 MSK.
Teenagers picked up by helicopter from the Blue Mountains
Two teenage bushwalkers were taken by helicopter to a safe place after spending the night stuck in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old young man set out for a camp shortly after noon on Sunday in Govetts Lip in Blackheath.
Concerned relatives called the police around 8 p.m. when they did not return home.
A search group was sent, which included local police and rescue teams, and the pair were found around 11 p.m. near the Bridal Vale waterfall.
The girl injured her knee, and the young man fell and hurt his head.
The officers stayed with a couple for the night, and they were picked up on a winch on Monday morning.
They were transported in a stable ambulance to Blue Mountains Hospital.
There were two unions.
The negotiations at the highest level in Minsk did not solve the problems for which they were convened, but gave rise to a new format: the first persons of the European Union met with the first persons of the future Eurasian
Although on an alarming occasion (the situation around Ukraine does not tolerate delays), the leaders of the EU and Customs Union for the first time discussed a number of "hot problems".
Whether such a structure is capable of working effectively is unclear; however, it is clear who removed the creams from this summit.
Questions about this fell on the evening of August 26, when the Belarusians, and after them the other Eurasians with the Europeans saw in the news of the new President Lukashenko.
The Belarusian leader set an example of refined courtesy, it was the behavior of a man who just broke the jackpot - and plans a decent old age in a higher society.
How Maidan Lukashenko helped
The arrival in Minsk of the three main European commissioners (EU ministers) who met with Lukashenko and allowed him to speak at the final briefing on their behalf is not just the legitimacy of the president with 20 years of experience.
This is an application for recognition of Minsk as a full-fledged subject of European policy and the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
Senior analyst at the Belarusian Institute of Strategic Studies Denis Melyantsov is convinced that from now on Brussels will no longer be able to talk to Minsk in the same tone as before.
“The fact that Catherine Ashton met with Lukashenko gives reason to believe that relations with the EU will continue to freeze,” he told Fire.
This iceberg has a hidden part: preparations for the breakthrough Belarusian authorities began long before the November Maidan in Kiev in the summer of 2013.
"Results were achieved with the EU - these were successful negotiations on visa simplification and readmission, dialogues on modernization - lists the interlocutor of "Fire" - and negotiations on international security were held with the United States.
The U.S. has lifted some sanctions.
As for the Ukrainian events, they themselves and the reaction of the Belarusian leadership to them have only tarnished this process.
Minsk, on the one hand, managed to maintain relations with Ukraine - warm enough not to lose much in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for negotiations.
On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who de jure did not recognize the annexation of Crimea to Russia and called for the punishment of pro-Russian militias in the Donbas with all rigor, did not argue with Moscow.
Minsk did not leave the Customs Union or the CSTO, and the Russian air base is located in Baranovichi.
Brussels and Washington noted Minsk’s balanced position on the Ukrainian issue – and assessed it, Belarusian experts are sure.
How successful Lukashenko’s movement for political diversification will be, will be seen by how often in the near future Minsk will have to host meetings in the format of EU+TS.
In the press service of the High Representative of the EU for Foreign Policy and Diplomacy, Catherine Ashton was unable to respond promptly to questions about what Brussels expects from relations in the new format.
The spokeswoman, Ashton Maya Kosyan<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87>, merely told Fire that, against the backdrop of war and peace issues, this issue is not a priority.
At the same time, there were reports that Kazakhstan could be the next meeting place on the Ukrainian issue with the participation of the first persons in the new format.
A cappella for Minsk was a statement by President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that he was, it turns out, personally asked by representatives of the European Union.
However, at the final briefing, Alexander Lukashenko made it clear: all parties are not against Minsk remaining the central platform for meetings both in the Russia-OSCE-Ukraine format and at the level of Heads of State and High Representatives of the European Commission.
This means that the “last dictator of Europe” is given the status of a hand-held European leader who helps solve the global problem.
Best friend of a European farmer
Already the composition of the EU delegation, which included the European Commissioners for Trade and Energy, urged the conclusion: the main background of the summit is not the tragic situation in the Donbass, but the economy.
In fact, the timetable for future negotiations on gas supplies and overcoming the concerns of the TC countries about the association agreement between Ukraine and the EU seems to be a larger achievement than peace declarations without specific dates and figures.
Trade Commissioner Carl De Gucht, however, said: “EU representatives have come to Minsk to seek a solution to the political crisis that has economic consequences, not the other way around.”
It seems, however, that in the economy, the crisis in Ukraine "works" on Belarus.
Its consequences – and primarily the mutual sanctions of the West and Russia – give Minsk, which itself is currently experiencing sanctions pressure, a long-awaited field for maneuvering.
According to the head of the Research Center of Mises, former candidate for president of Belarus Yaroslav Romanchuk, European investors are actively interested in Belarus’ opportunities for agricultural products in the Russian Federation in circumvention of sanctions.
At the same time, the schemes of supplies for which Vladimir Putin at the summit rushed Minsk are being put forward.
"The initiators of these schemes are not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies," Romanchuk stressed.
They have long worked out schemes for the supply of goods, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes are destroyed.
Russian business urgently needs to somehow restore them, even through the mediation of Belarusian structures.
The second plot, continues the expert, is related to the fact that many Ukrainian companies are not afraid to set up production in Belarus from Ukrainian raw materials also with a focus on the Russian market.
Ukrainian producers have about $4 billion worth of exports to Russia, and Belarusian production and trade schemes may now be in high demand.
According to Romanchuk, the role of the host of the platform for EU and TC negotiations is ideal for Lukashenko and in terms of the development of economic relations with Europe.
He recalls that the losses of the EU agricultural sector from Moscow’s sanctions are estimated at 5-10 billion euros, and the European Commission has currently offered farmers only 125 million euros in compensation.
The Belarusian president may invite Brussels to work together to minimize the consequences for European farmers.
This could raise Lukashenko’s credibility in the EU to unprecedented heights.
Hospitality without initiative
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the initiative to hold the summit.
But the paradox is that the official Minsk from its active role in the birth of the TS+EU format is rejected, and the Belarusian leader at a meeting with a Ukrainian colleague stressed that the initiator of the new format has become Kiev.
"It was your proposal to meet, without any hesitation to discuss, not from the bay to make a decision, after the signing of the Association Agreement with the EU, to understand the situation that was developing at that time in Ukraine," he said in front of cameras to Petro Poroshenko.
However, observers interpreted this as an attempt to reassure Moscow, which, according to rumors, was initially against the mediation of Minsk, which greatly increases its political weight.
In the Belarusian diplomatic office carefully emphasize that while organizing the cooperation between the EU and the TS on its land, Belarus does not pursue selfish goals, and the ultimate goal of such a format is the creation of a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok in the future.
"It is absolutely in the spirit of those concepts that in other areas, in particular in the sphere of security, advances and advances the leadership of our strategic ally - the Russian Federation," the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belarus, an office where words have been meticulously selected recently, said.
In Moscow, there may be zones with paid entry
The Moscow government is considering the option of introducing zones with paid entry as a method of combating congestion of central roads by analogy with other major cities of the world, reports M24.ru with reference to the Moscow mayor on transport issues Maxim Liksutov.
One of the options that has successfully proven itself is a paid entry.
This is an expert opinion, we will definitely study it, look at all the disadvantages and advantages.
To say that some decisions have been taken on this matter, until it is too early," Liksutov said.
Zammar stressed that for the authorities of the capital, the experience of Asian cities, which are similar in structure and congestion to Moscow, is very important.
One of the decisions taken from these countries is the already implemented construction of the central ring road, Liksutov added.
The recent construction of the Central Ring Road is an example of the fact that it is not necessary to pass all the traffic through Moscow.
If there was enough infrastructure for the driveway, then there was no need to have transit traffic in Moscow," Zammar said.
Also, Maxim Liksutov said that the introduction of paid parking significantly unloaded the capital's streets.
And, according to him, the capital authorities do not plan to stop at what has been achieved.
On August 26, the mayor of the Russian capital, Sergey Sobyanin, participated in the ceremony for the construction of the first launch complex of the Moscow Central Ring Road (CKAD).
Boredom is sinful.
The film by Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez, The City of Sins 2: A Woman Worth Killing, was not the kind of revolution he was expected to make.
The first "City of Sins" (2005), shot with the minimal but symbolic participation of Quentin Tarantino, revolutionized the relationship between cinema, comics and literary noir.
Sequel is also revolutionary in its own way: in the sense that it destroys the chain fundamental to modern thinking "thesis - antithesis - synthesis" (if the universe of noara is understood by the thesis, and by the antithesis - the cosmos of comics).
From now on it should be read: "thesis is antithesis is chaos".
"City of Sins-2" is chaotic both at the dramaturgical and philosophical level: both times it is chaotic in the bad sense of the word.
Yes, some of the heroes are familiar with the first "City", although, here, Marv (Mickey Rourke), remembers, ended his life in an electric chair, and here, nothing, only manages to extract - in the role of such a popular friend - from the air knives and other axes with blows.
But the old people are literally pushed with the elbows of a newcomer, as if they broke into the city from some other film, about the meaning and plot of which the viewers are asked not to worry.
So, its story, shamelessly cut off by the authors in the most interesting place, with the super-lucky player Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).
Hers is with the lusty-frigid Eva Lord (Eva Green) and for something avenging her Dwight (Josh Brolin).
But this confusion, in which Dwight is, let us say, face-to-face indistinguishable from Johnny - especially since faces, like other parts of the body, are worn down by the characters with unrelenting regularity - is not trouble and not even half trouble.
These are not people, but we understand that these are archetypes of the noir: a rock bitch, too confident a player, who has fallen into the "honey trap" of sex detective, a corrupt Upyr-Senator.
Well, when an archetype rolls with an archetype and an archetype chases, it's no longer a movie, but read that abstract painting.
And to ask abstract painting questions about the logic of the plot is just funny.
And even in this turbulent world, there is something permanent.
The fighting sluts from the first "City" still hold the circular defense from the slums of the forces of darkness that are besieging them.
Yeah, and Detective Hartigan's ghost no-no, and he'll look at the light, and Bruce Willis is always nice to look at.
The main problem of City of Sins 2 is another.
Frank Miller was good at how the cartoonist talentedly combined comics and noir, and as a director - reversed the idea of how to transfer comics to the screen.
Comics and noir are two aggressively opposite "reality."
The phenomenon of comics in its modern form was born in the late 1920s, when the novels of Dashil Hammett "Bloody Harvest" (1929), "The Maltese Falcon" (1930) and "The Glass Key" (1931) created the canon of Nora, then called a hard-boiled school.
Well, or pulp fiction.
The comics gave Hollywood many dozens of heroes: from sailor Poppa, a spinach eater, giving it heroic power, Superman, Batman, and detective Dick Tracy, to Hulk, Thor, Spider-Man, and other "vengeful" characters.
But in any movie on the motives of comics there was something harmful: the drawn characters persistently did not want to dress up as screen flesh, remained pretenders in the world around them will-involuntary "real" world.
Simply put, they were completely deprived of “existence.”
Noir, on the contrary, is the most existential genre of world literature.
After the world wars, the traditional romance - with its experiences, characters, family scandals and historical background - lost all persuasion.
What Forsyths, what Tibo and Rugon-Maccara, what Bolkons and Rostovs are even conceivable after Verden, Auschwitz and Hiroshima?
Such a novel has peacefully mutated into a soap opera format, and the criminal - that is, by definition marginal - the novel has risen to the level of philosophical prose.
Hammett learned on his skin what it was like to work as a plumber on the front.
He was a communist.
How, by the way, were at least close to the Communist Party and such pillars of the genre as writers Horace McCoy and Jim Thompson, directors Jules Dassen, Joseph Lawsey, Edward Dmitryk.
Therefore, the noir, the archetype of which they set, firstly, is rude and cynical, and secondly, purely social.
This is almost an American version of social realism.
The first "City of Sins" was remarkable precisely because it was unnatural, but organically connected the comic with the noir.
For the first time on the screen, the comic came to life, not ashamed of its graphic nature, and did not pretend to be a "real" film.
The darkness of the vicious world, where the cardinal ordered murder, and the senator covered the monstrous son of a sadist, was quite worthy of Hammett's pen.
And the picturesque details like the severed heads with which the sadist decorated his nest, the pen of the genius James Ellroy, the author of the "Black Orchid" and the best - that is, declaratively nauseating - representative of the neon.
"City of Sins 2" is not even a retreat, but a capitulation of Miller-Rodriguez's radical style to the comics tradition.
This is largely due to 3D technology.
When you watch the second "City of Sins", you feel trapped in a glass ball, inside of which the snow puts a toy clog.
However, most often it is not snow, but bloody eyelashes, but in general, what is the difference?
There is nothing to talk about socialism.
After all, it is possible only when somewhere, somewhere we sometimes have, albeit on the side of a dirty swamp, but there is a normal world, where you can return the girl who went on a curved path or, say, tell the restless parents that her killer is punished.
But when there is no place in the city for sin except sin, sin is no longer sin, but the norm.
It's boring, like any other rule.
Chaos "City of Sins-2" just boring.
For the sake of justice, the domestic rent gave this fresh sin a small, but peppery.
The titles warn: the film contains harmful scenes of smoking.
In relation to the spectacle, in the most vegetarian episode of which a person's fingers are broken with pinches, it gives hellish humor.
Hammett would have liked it.
France’s socialists must “shut up and put France in order,” says key ally Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande
Mr. Wall called on the deeply divided left to “demonstrate a warm attitude” towards the attacking socialist president, whose reshuffles were not approved by the overwhelming majority of the French.
The president deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
“It’s our duty to stay with him,” he said, evoking applause.
As a gesture of reconciliation, the prime minister assured that his government would not call into question the controversial 35-hour working week in France, despite inciting conflict proposals, it should weaken the rules made by Emmanuel Macron, the new economy minister, earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande begged his comrades in the Socialist Party to remain “alone” with the government.
However, Christian Tobias, the Minister of Justice, put sticks in the wheels, coming to a meeting of dissenting members of parliament from the Socialist Party and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing the French to "lose faith in the future".
Marine Le Pee, the leader of the far-right National Front, expressed contempt for the ongoing internal conflicts among the Socialists, saying she did not imagine that Wall’s new government would last longer than a few months.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande is a naked king, but a naked and Prince Manuel Valls, forced to assemble a new government when the previous one did not last and the summer.
"And the new will not last autumn or winter either," Le Pen told reporters.
She reiterated her party’s call for the dissolution of parliament, saying she was confident that the party could easily win early elections and was ready to govern.
France’s ruling party suffered defeat in the March municipal elections, and the far-right National Front came first in the EU elections in May.
A poll by Sunday’s Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of French people believe the Socialist Party risks splitting into several rival factions by the end of Mr Hollande’s presidential term in 2017.
Pascal Perrino, a political scientist at Ciance Poe University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government failed to fix the economy and record unemployment.
“He has little time, but public opinion needs to quickly feel that something is changing,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get even worse.
“City Without Drugs” Has Been Left Without a Lawsuit
The Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court has left without consideration the claims of the administrative department of the regional ministry for the management of state property to the fund "City without drugs".
The agency intended to collect more than 7 million rubles from the organization as a fee for renting a building in the center of Yekaterinburg.
However, the plaintiff did not appear in court twice.
Today, the Arbitration Court of the Sverdlovsk region left without consideration the claims of the Executive Directorate of the Ministry of Management of State Property of the region (MUGISO) to the fund "City without drugs" (one of the founders - the Mayor of Yekaterinburg Evgeny Roizman).
Representatives of the regional authorities intended to collect from the organization 7.3 million rubles. as a fee for the rent of the building.
Today, it became known that the plaintiff had not appeared in court twice, and therefore a decision was taken to refuse the examination.
The reason for the absence of representatives in the MUGISO Directorate could not be explained, the head of the legal department Maxim Titov did not answer the phone calls.
The Fund was also not contacted.
Recall, we are talking about a mansion, which occupied the foundation in the center of the city on 19 Belinsky Street, free of charge since 2011.
This decision was made by the former governor Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the Executive Directorate of the Ministry of State Property Management of the Sverdlovsk Region filed a claim with the Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court for eviction of the fund from the building.
According to the claim, the agency demanded through the court to recognize the free-of-charge contract as the premises of the mansion-monument.
In the opinion of the MUGISO Directorate, the agreement did not include any significant conditions for renting a cultural heritage object.
The Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court rejected the claim, then an appeal was filed in the 17th Arbitration Court of Perm, which was satisfied.
The fund then filed a cassation complaint with the same court for this decision, which remained unsatisfactory, after which the decision was appealed by the fund to the Supreme Court of Arbitration, but the court accepted the direction.
In 2013, a new lease was signed, according to which the fund began to pay the rent again, said the head of the city Eugene Roizman.
The rent was assigned 300,000 rubles. per month.
The previous administration of the region gave us this building for free use, recognizing our merits in the fight against drugs, as a sign of respect for the fund.
The current administration has decided differently," he said.
Tatyana Drogaeva, Yekaterinburg
Why the Mayor of Yekaterinburg was offered to leave voluntarily
On July 24, the deputy of the pride of Yekaterinburg, Aleksandr Kosintsev, proposed to the mayor of the city - the speaker of pride Eugene Roizman to resign.
The occasion was a criminal case against the arrested on suspicion of murdering a retired member of parliament of pride Oleg Kinev, considered an associate of the mayor.
How Eugene Roisman found a criminal case
On July 1, it became known about the initiation of a criminal case on the fact of "defamation" (Article 128.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation) in the blog of the Mayor of Yekaterinburg Eugene Roizman.
This was reported to the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Sverdlovsk region, where Anna Filatova, the director general of the legal center "Protection", addressed the relevant statement.
According to her, Mr. Roizman accused her in his blog posts of being involved in crimes allegedly committed by her ex-husband.
The mayor of Yekaterinburg is convinced that “this is another attempt to avenge the truth”.
iPhone to be turned into a wallet
On the eve of September 9, when Apple is due to present its new developments, the press is getting more and more leaks about what to expect from the presentation.
U.S. media reports that the sixth generation of iPhones will be equipped with a mobile wallet as a result of Apple’s joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express payment systems.
According to Bloomberg and the specialized Internet resource Re/code, at the presentation of new products on September 9, Apple among other things can announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express, as a result of which the new iPhone 6 will be available mobile wallet function.
The company itself refuses to comment on this matter.
This feature allows you to make a payment at the checkout of the store with the help of a smartphone.
The payment will be identified by the user’s fingerprint using the Touch ID function.
It is reported that the iPhone for the first time will be built in NFC (near field communication) technology, which allows you to make contactless payment using a smartphone and the corresponding reader device at the checkout.
The NFC technology itself will be available thanks to a special microprocessor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (formerly Philips Semiconductors).
The NFC feature was first introduced in 2004 as part of a collaboration between Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors and more than a hundred other companies that have joined the so-called NFC Forum - an association to promote this technology.
The first NFC phone was released by Nokia in 2006.
The first Android smartphone with NFC function - Samsung Nexus S - was introduced in 2010.
In May 2011, Google introduced the Google Wallet system, which allows users to attach bank cards to their Google account and pay using a smartphone on Android.
However, U.S. experts emphasize that, despite the large investments of high-tech companies in the advancement of NFC technology, U.S. retailers are still cautious about innovation and are not too willing to spend money on equipping their stores with such systems.
Therefore, observers now hope that Apple's entry into this market will still force retailers to accelerate and more actively implement this technology in their outlets.
French Foreign Ministry: Paris' position on deliveries to Russia "Mistrales" does not change
The official representative of the French Foreign Ministry, Roman Nadal, said about the unchanged position of Paris regarding the supply of Russian helicopter carriers of the type "Mistral".
"I can recall a statement made by the President of the Republic (Francois Hollande) in an interview with the newspaper Le Monde on August 20: "Today the level of sanctions does not prevent delivery.
This is the decision of the Europeans, not France," Nadal quoted RIA Novosti as saying.
Thus, the representative of the French Foreign Ministry answered the question of whether the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine will not affect the change of the position of Paris on the implementation of this contract.

Norwegian Cruise Closes to a $3 Billion Deal with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise operator in the world, is in the final stages of negotiations to acquire a similar company Prestige Cruises International Inc for approximately $3 billion, according to people familiar with the situation.
The deal would provide Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to luxury cruise ships and secured Prestige Cruises customers, as it competes with larger rivals Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp.
The deal could be announced as early as this week, sources said on Sunday, warning that negotiations could still fail.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, a private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 percent of the shares in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain unnamed, as the negotiations were not open.
The representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while the representative of Apollo refused to comment on the information.
Based in Miami, Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes spanning North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenue was $2.57 billion in 2013, 13 percent more than in 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the Oceania and Regent brands, which together own eight cruise ships that go to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenues of $1.2 billion in 2013, 6% higher than a year earlier.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to be positively impacted in the coming years by middle-class growth in emerging economies such as China and India.
The race companies strive to position themselves as the cruise operators preferred by these new customers.
Prestige Cruises was registered with U.S. regulators for the initial public offering of shares in January 2014.
Apollo became the company’s main shareholder after a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created as it exists today in 2000 as a result of a merger with the cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), an entertainment conglomerate and a casino under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thea.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise became a public company in January 2013.
Genting owned a 28 percent stake, Apollo owned a 20 percent stake, and private investment firm TPG Capital LP owned an 8 percent stake in the company, as of the end of June, according to reports.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82 percent of the cruise passenger flow in North America, according to registration documents at the first public placement of Prestige Cruises shares.

Also, the money will go to buy equipment, repair the roof and power systems in the building of the radio company, founded in 1959, reports RIA Novosti.
Activists of Hong Kong’s democratic movement interrupt the Chinese representative’s speech the day after the decision on the election
A group of citizens loyal to Beijing stood nearby, waving the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the People’s Assembly of China on Sunday determined a procedure under which only two or three candidates will be allowed to participate in the 2017 election of Hong Kong’s leader.
All candidates must first get the support of most members of the nomination committee, which is likely to be filled with Beijing loyalists.
The decision makes it almost impossible for the democratic opposition to get in the ballot and has forced activists of the democratic movement to once again promise to stop Hong Kong’s financial center with “Occupy Central” protests.
Political reform is a major source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders fear the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following Beijing’s publication of a document describing China’s control of Hong Kong, in June, activists of the democratic movement held an informal referendum on elections in a special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands went to the city’s business center and staged a sit-down strike.
The briefing is organized by the Hong Kong Government and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the People’s Assembly of China Zhang Rongshun and Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macau Bureau of Affairs of the Feng Wei State Council were also scheduled to deliver a series of briefings during the day.
The activist students said they would meet outside the Hong Kong government building in the afternoon.
Britain did not mention democratic governance for Hong Kong until the last 150 years of its colonial rule.
The Israeli authorities intend to annex 400 hectares of land belonging to the Palestinian Authority.
The Israeli authorities have announced that they intend to annex 400 hectares of land on the west bank of the Jordan River belonging to the Palestinian Authority.
According to the BBC, the decision to annex the land of South Bethlehem is linked to a desire to pay for the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers in June of this year.
Israel’s defense ministry said on Sunday it was seizing the territory and instructed the military to establish an administrative administration on the West Bank.
According to the representative of the Gaza sector Saib Arikat, the world public should call Israel to account for "continued settlement activity on the West Bank and in East Jerusalem".
Putin urges Kiev to start talks on “statehood” of eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports about his remarks, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting with separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the "statehood" of the divided region.
His press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean to imply that eastern Ukrainian territory under separatist control would become part of Russia, but that its status inside Ukraine needs to be revised to give the Russian-speaking region the opportunity to defend its rights and interests.
However, Putin’s call to the Kiev government to start negotiations with pro-Russian rebels as equals corresponded to the obvious strategy he had followed since the beginning of the bloodshed five months ago: to help the separatists to take the territory away from the fact and to force the Ukrainian government to give the newly declared territory.
In an interview with the state-run First TV channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to return the separatist-held territory in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which was captured in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists have recently named the occupied territories Novorossiya, or New Russia, a name that refers to the pre-revolutionary days of glory of the Russian Empire.
Putin said anyone who believes that peace talks will happen in the near future, when Ukrainian politicians start campaigning for parliamentary elections on October 26, and while government troops attack peaceful settlements in the separatist-held regions, was a prisoner of ILO.
"We must immediately start substantive negotiations, not only on technical issues, but also on the political structure of society and the state status of southeastern Ukraine, in order to respect the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said Putin’s words about statehood were meant in the context of broader autonomy, which had been discussed for months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to soothe fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and language rights were at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
This is not a question for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The Kremlin’s intervention to correct Putin’s “misinterpretation” of the words underlined the Russian leadership’s decision to behave in relation to the separatist uprising in the east in a way other than the open seizure of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million population is ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have to endure a much heavier battle to join even the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million residents are not Russians, and polls before the conflict showed broad support for the desire to remain inside Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats discussed in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine trade agreements and foreign policy themselves, essentially by handing the Kremlin with actual control over the territory that would connect the main territory of Russia with Crimea.
On the Black Sea peninsula, annexed five months ago, is the main Russian navy, as well as commercial maritime establishments and historical seaside resorts.
In the regions between the Russian Rostov region and Crimea there are also mines, factories and foundries that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed during his inaugural speech on June 7 that Ukrainian lawmakers weigh amendments to the constitution after the new elections, allowing the separated regions to have more control over their finances and the status of languages.
However, his view of autonomy seems to be very different from that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whose arms and incitement Moscow is accused of.
Putin’s latest call to Kiev to negotiate with separatist leaders as equals followed a new insurgent offensive last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area along the Sea of Azov.
Russian-backed separatists have taken control of the city of Novoazovsk in an offensive that Ukrainian security officials say they fear is the beginning of a campaign to seize strategic coastal territory up to Crimea itself.
This entailed large-scale civilian and military efforts to strengthen Mariupol, a steel port with 500,000 inhabitants, which is located between Novoazovsk and the narrow passage to the Crimean Peninsula.
On Saturday, Poroshenko appealed to the European Union's leaders in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet republic that had been independent for 23 years.
“We are approaching the point of no return,” Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign tanks are now in Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take certain measures; the leaders called for a draft of more severe sanctions against Russia, which will be adopted in the event of any escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to leave their positions in Ilovaysk after two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 soldiers entered the Donetsk region last week to support troubled separatists, Colonel Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for the National Security and Defense Council, told the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry.
The first of 63 Ukrainian soldiers, who are reportedly detained in Ilovaysk as a result of the Russian invasion, were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian airstrikes captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
A scandal with nude photos captures Australian celebrities and Gaby Greco
Jeffrey Edelsten expressed his disgust at the hackers, who may have stolen nude photos of his fiancée Gaby Greco and an entire list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood is outraged after a series of open photos depicting the nude Jennifer Lawrence hit the internet as a result of a large-scale hacking scandal with celebrities.
It is said that the hacker responsible for this, has about 60 open photos of the star of "Hunger Games" Lawrence and superstars, including models Kate Upton and Kara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lia Michel and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actors Theresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strachowski and Melbourne-based Greco also allegedly stole photos as a result of an iCloud leak.
In the list of 101 the name of celebrities.
Edelsten, who made Greco's offer last month, told Confidential: "It's disgusting."
All private correspondence and photographs must remain private.
It is terrible that personal information can be stolen and passed on to other people.
Greco, who is based in New York, reportedly told the news website that the hacker attack was “shameful” and that those to whom it was directed “feel that they have been invaded.”
The hacker is believed to have 30 photos of Palmer with ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two footage of her lying by a pool with bare breasts.
Palmer's film work includes "Love and Honor" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the star of the film "Chuck" Strachowski and the actress from "Forbidden Reception" Browning yesterday did not comment on the stolen photos.
Lawrence told TMZ, “This is a brutal invasion of privacy.”
Actor Seth Rogen expressed his indignation at the hacker, writing on Twitter: “Posting photos stolen from a mobile phone is actually no different from selling stolen goods.”
Just from a legal point of view, you can not tolerate the publication of stolen photos.
A potential way to steal photos of naked celebrities has been discovered
The massive hack of Star Accounts may have been caused by a vulnerability in the Find My Phone app.
A potential scenario for the development of events was described by The Next Web resource.
A Python script was published on Github, which allowed you to select passwords for Apple’s Find My Phone service.
This service allows you to track the location of the iPhone.
To access it, it uses the same band of Apple ID login and password as to access the Apple iCloud cloud, from which photos of celebrities were stolen.
The script allowed the method of override to recognize the password from Find My Phone.
In this method, all possible combinations of symbols are introduced, starting with the most commonly used passwords.
The author of the script claimed that in the service Find My Phone the number of options of passwords entered is unlimited.
With the correct organization of the security system after several unsuccessful attempts to enter the wrong password, the account should be blocked and inform the user of the attempted hack.
Due to the vulnerability, users did not receive any messages about an attempt to retrieve a password for their account.
Hackers learned the password from Apple ID and used it to access iCloud.
According to a hackapp user on Twitter, the vulnerability was discovered two days ago, on Saturday, and a password-selection script was written to it.
At the moment, the vulnerability is closed: after five attempts, access to the service is blocked.
The resource contacted the user Hackapp and he noted that the above-mentioned vulnerability is typical for many services, but noted that there is no evidence that such a vulnerability was used to access the Stars account.
It's not me, plz RT
On Twitter, the Prime Minister once again appeared foreign recordings
While there is no solid evidence that a vulnerability in Find My Phone was used to steal photos, there has already been a wave of malicious activity using this service.
The hackers intercepted the device and demanded a ransom from the owners.
In that case, Apple told the media that in this case, the security of the cloud was not compromised, but did not investigate how users lost their accounts.
Earlier, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev’s Twitter was hacked.
If the attackers gained access to iCloud in the way described above, then there could be stored a password to the account of the head of government in the microblogging service.
The Next Web source failed to get Apple’s comments about the vulnerability in Find My Phone.

SCR stopped the investigation of the accident Tu-204 in Vnukovo
The Investigative Committee of Russia (SCR) has terminated the criminal case on the fact of the crash of the Tu-204 aircraft of the airline Red Wings.

Anger is the most universal and functional human emotion.
Angry facial expression is biologically universal for humanity, and every organ and muscle group involved in its creation is not random, but is an additional means of expressing power and threat, scientists from Australia and the United States have found.
They told about their discoveries in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior, and can be read briefly about them in the press release of the University of California, Santa Barbara.
The angry expression of the face is shifted and lowered down the eyebrows, stretched into a thin line of lips, swollen nostrils - the same in all cultures, and make it even blind from birth children who have never seen it, says lead author of the study Aaron Sell.
As part of a major research project on the nature of anger, scientists have found out that this emotion has arisen to effectively manage disputes during conflict.
The more physical damage one person can do to another, the more he has the ability to dictate his conditions, and he reports it to the interlocutor with the help of anger.
The researchers found confirmations and another of their hypothesis: physically strong people are more likely to be angry and move on to manual application, consider themselves entitled to impose unfavorable conditions on others, and also prefer violent methods of conflict resolution to peaceful ones.
Relying on the fact that anger is primarily an "emotion of bargaining", the scientists decided that the movements of each of the seven groups of muscles that create an angry facial expression should represent the angry individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interlocutor - and thus make the conflict as soon as possible agree with his conditions.
To verify this hypothesis, the researchers modeled on a computer the faces where each of the seven elements of the angry person was present or absent, and showed them to informants.
Although the lowered eyebrows or the forwarded chin did not individually make the face ill, the stronger physical features of the person depicted in the study were recognized unanimously.
Human anger, as in animals, expresses a threat: an exaggerated manifestation of one’s own strength, forcing one to agree and obey.
A person inflates the nostrils and presses the lips with the same purpose as a frog that inflates, or a baboon that shows its cheeks.
Anger is triggered by the refusal of the interlocutor to accept the situation, and the person immediately takes a form that demonstrates the consequences of this refusal to the opposite side as effectively as possible.
But the most striking thing is that none of the components of an angry person is arbitrary, they all express the same thing,” said anthropologist John Tubby.
