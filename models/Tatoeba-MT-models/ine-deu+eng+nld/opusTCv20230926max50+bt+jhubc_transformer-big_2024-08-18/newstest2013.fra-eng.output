A Republican Strategy to Counter Obama's Re-Election
Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth, claiming that electoral fraud is rarer in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
In fact, Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of voter fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, U.S. states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
It was in this spirit that a majority of U.S. governments enacted new laws starting in 2009 that made the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon gained momentum following the November 2010 elections, which saw the addition of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States were introduced during the year 2011 alone.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID card and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also reduce the periods of early voting, invalidate the right to register as an elector on the day of the election and withdraw citizens with a judicial record their right to vote.
Prior to the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID card.
Indiana was the first state to make such a demand.
In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Indiana law.
The Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID card.
It is important to note that, unlike in Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal identity card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have photo ID cards issued by a government agency in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an identity card.
However, it often costs more than one hundred dollars to obtain the required ID card.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and low-income people.
Indeed, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required photo ID.
A lot more.
Students, voters considered to be voting more for Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several states to use their identity card with photo issued by their institution.
On the other hand, these same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use the cards issued by these clubs to vote.
Prior to 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to make such a demand.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting Hispanic voting.
Two out of three Hispanic voters are in favor of the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers sponsored laws in 2011 that abolished voter registration on election day in eight states.
In addition, they have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register.
These restrictions are not without consequence.
For example, in the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns helped register about 10 million citizens.
However, measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the registration rate of new voters by 17% in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have passed laws in five other states aimed at reducing the early voting period.
For example, in the 2008 Florida general election, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African-American, while the latter represented only 13% of the state’s voters.
It was the same with the Hispanics.
These only represented 11% of the electorate, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, whites who made up 76% of voters represented only 46% of voters voting in advance.
Of course, the Democratic legislators and their supporters strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several bills have been blocked by vetoes from Democratic governors.
The Attorney General of the United States intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID card.
Nevertheless, the new rules in place will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted on and see it as an obvious goal to influence the results in 2012 in key states.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Centre shows that the states that passed these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required by the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Screening for prostate cancer: pass the test or not?
Indeed, the APS test would sometimes present erroneous results, with false negative results or even false positives, which lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
What to do even more hesitating men already reluctant to pass screening tests.
Pass the test or not?
We asked for the advice of two experts.
In studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and have firm recommendations.
Another study, the European one, found a difference in mortality between patients who had a screening and those who did not.
This study also showed, with follow-up after 12 years, that you are between 30 and 40% more likely to have metastases if you are not detected.
I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if you have a direct relative who has already had prostate cancer.
African-American men are also at higher risk.
The key is to make the right decision once cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and others that are indolent.
It is really necessary to make the patient understand the degree of risk of his cancer, offering him the possible options, not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not affect long-term life, and instead opting, in these cases, for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who are diagnosed with cancer will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
We're going to suggest that they do active surveillance, and if the disease progresses, we're going to give them treatment.
Increasingly, criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated are being precisely determined.
I still recommend passing the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine if you should pass it or not.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has created a tool to assess the pros and cons of APS testing.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe for preventing cancer.
Despite advances in research, adopting good habits of life remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from them.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
“If no one smoked, this rate would rise to at least 50%,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Many are also completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Cigarettes are linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for many others.
This is very damaging to people’s health.
“There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today,” said spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging Fact: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer falls by half.
The weight
Overweight and obesity also promote the onset of the disease, according to CSC.
They would increase the risk of cancer of the breast, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
“Research shows that regular physical activity for a lifetime protects against colon cancer,” it added.
Dietary
The body also recommends limiting its consumption of red meat.
In too large a quantity, it increases the risk of getting colorectal cancer.
Stuffed meats too, and they should be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
“The latter can damage the body’s cells and lead to the development of cancer,” it said.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their research is not conclusive at the moment.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the CSC.
While one observed a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another noted an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly established either.
In addition, Mr. Beaulieu stressed the importance of discussing his concerns and family history with his doctor.
"Passing a screening test doesn't give you cancer."
The Higgs boson debarked
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson created quite a stir last summer, and for good reason.
It is believed that this boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the universe, just that.
And then it is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "lesser" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists, it is not yet completely certain that this is Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we hold an authentic new particle, and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data unveiled this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto seems to confirm this, but data is still lacking to be perfectly sure.
Let's assume it's Higgs anyway, since the chances of getting it wrong seem slim, and let's see what it's about.
There is, in this low world, a fatally unavoidable law that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
No way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you're going to hurt yourself.
Although particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has a law of this kind: the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" consisting roughly of some of their characteristics.
From there, physicists classify particles into two categories.
In a corner, we find good citizens called Fermions, who wisely obey the principle of Pauli.
And in the other are the bosons, a dirty band of anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least not for that principle, which means they can be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are then divided into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, by the way) The Particle Adventure, Berkeley Laboratories: the mesons, which we will not approach here, and the "force particles", by which the great forces of nature propagate and to which the Higgs boson would be in some way related.
These bosons, it must be emphasized here, are not all beasts as exotic as one might think.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "particle of light" that is the "messenger" of electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle with an electrical charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disrupts" the electromagnetic field in this specific place, a bit like a stone thrown into a pond.
From this "interference" arises an electromagnetic wave (of light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore one of the "force-carrying" bosons.
More stable field
The same is true of the Higgs boson, except that it is another field, the Higgs field, which must be "disrupted" for this boson to appear.
Now, this Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, one must reach very, very high energies, a little as if it were a frozen pond of which only a very large rock could ride the surface.
That's why we need a huge particle accelerator like CERN's - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring 27 km in circumference! - to reach such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
It is not all particles, or all materials, that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never hold itself on a refrigerator.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while others (like the photon, yours) do not.
Now, what “can bring” all this research, asks Ms. Plamondon?
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also allows physicists to scrutinize any gaps between MS observations and predictions.
Moreover, there are many to be wished that we could find them, because the slightest difference could open a door on a "new physical" and clog some holes in the Model.
This, it must be said, still has huge shortcomings, proposing no explanation for gravity (oops!) or dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter of the Universe (re-oops!).
But no such deviations have been found at CERN so far.
Repercussions
The repercussions of this research in the daily life of Mr and Mrs All-the-World are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will not be any.
At the very beginning of the 1960s, the pioneers of the laser, in the Bell Laboratories, did not suspect the revolution that their work was going to trigger.
They were looking at scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first ones were pulsed), in 1962 - already told us that the laser was initially seen as a "lab gadget".
Imagine...
And then, the applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969, during his work on optics.
This sensor, although it was not at all its original intention, now serves as an "eye" to all digital cameras in the world, and earned it the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
Of course, this doesn’t mean that the LHC’s activities will necessarily transform our lives, but it does mean that, really, we never know...
Palliative care - The best way to die...
With its Commission to Die in Dignity, Quebec recently debated the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate is expected to resume shortly as a bill is being prepared.
However, in this crucial area, much remains to be done.
The duty tried to look at it more closely.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his Montérégie apartment.
The prostate cancer that bit him had left him a two-year pause.
"They had given me five years to live, I was seven years old," he said, half fig half grape, lying in his bed at the palliative care home Victor-Gadbois, of Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for that," he says.
The disease does its job: a huge weakness that prevents him from going to the toilet alone, and even from eating alone.
Stuck in front of an appetizing lunch, he agrees to be helped to eat, resigned.
Courageous, he even smiles, speaks to strangers who fight around him, bring him his medicines, offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
“My biggest wish is to be cured of diarrhea, it’s humiliating,” he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this ailment.
"During our lives, we learn that a man pisses standing up," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois house.
Regressing to the child’s stage, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the person's ability" to accept regression, he notes.
Because, in the opinion of several people working in palliative care, great moments are unfolding at the very heart of this regression.
Patients entering the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this point, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer provide so-called "curative" care.
For Ms. A., 89, the worst fear is to die “consciously and stifled.”
But the disease made me discover my children.
“I have good children,” she adds.
"I don't have any wishes in life anymore," she said, before accepting that she's being put on a mask to help her breathe.
In the coming days, however, she awaits a final visit from her son from Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, we provide, with a group of volunteers, body care and food assistance.
These are palliative care, which is given when there is nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is a palliative care bed for 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little when we know that we all end up dying one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the house.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
As a dying person, we will agree to provide oral care to brandy or Pepsi, depending on the request.
Diabetics will no longer be required to control their sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night, we had a beer for Mr. X, who passed away last night.
This morning, it is his son who will finish the beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We help loved ones as much as patients,” says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
At the house of Victor-Gadbois, the days follow but do not resemble each other.
Alongside a 93-year-old man enjoying his last family gathering in the yard, tucked in his pillows while drinking in his honor, a 36-year-old man tragically dies, surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children, after trying everything to survive.
“For the past six months, there have always been three to five beds that are occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45,” says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadbois home come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient has reached the terminal phase of his or her life, whether at home, in the hospital or in the nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois House and the Société de cares palliatives <0xC3><0xA0> domicile du Grand Montréal, specialize more or less exclusively in the care offered to cancer patients.
It is precisely this great shortage in Quebec's health care that makes several physicians specializing in palliative care fear the adoption of a law governing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed by palliative care summits including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to testify to their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not efficient enough to ensure that everyone will be entitled to quality palliative care before they agree to euthanasia.
Recently, she said, I saw a patient spend 14 days in the emergency room, in great pain, without being done what is necessary to relieve her.
I'm afraid patients only ask to die because they don't get proper care.
And at the same time, several oncologists have been harassing their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
Helen Richard’s survival expectations were already low when she gave up trying chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she replied that she regretted that I stopped fighting, she said.
Yet she had told me that I was done!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask to die thank caregivers for failing to meet their request after they were relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is absolutely not all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Society for Palliative Care at Home in Greater Montreal, patients would be refractory to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which means falling asleep until the patient dies, either sporadically or permanently.
We can no longer pretend not to hear that part of suffering.
Increasingly, the uneasy patient will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
Patients who are not relieved always say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want you to euthanize me,” it means “I want to be relieved.”
This report was made possible through a journalism grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road officials, BTP entrepreneurs, fund-raisers from political parties and Italian mafia specialists tell you every day what they know about a formidable “system” that mixes construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mobsters.
An “industry” that cost Quebec taxpayers a lot, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's curious how the system has been breaking down since we took the big steps," said Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former Montreal police chief.
It was through him that the scandal broke out in 2011, through a substantive investigation into the abuses related to road works contracts in Quebec, to which the Liberal Prime Minister of the time, Jean Charest, had only agreed to back off.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, occult party financing and corruption of civil servants.
“Since the start of the investigation in 2010, the only Department of Transportation would have saved a billion dollars on contracts,” some reluctantly said.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already dropped two mayors," he added, hoping it will "demonstrate the strategies behind individuals."
A permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, also works with its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
Plus the police of the "Marteau squad" who, since 2009, would have led the "cartel of sewers" of Montreal to put the soft pedal on the swellings of contracts...
In recent weeks, she has carried out serial searches and brought charges of fraud and corruption against municipal elected officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban city.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third city.
He's suspected of bribery on repeat in exchange for public contracts.
In addition, Montréal road engineers and Italian-born entrepreneurs, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, are formally charged.
The latter made a sensation by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
For years he paid 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to a mafia-linked intermediary who returned the money to Union Montréal, Mayor Gérald Tremblay's party.
Mr. Zambito sowed in all winds in the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (approximately 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals in power at the time.
He also confessed to organising an illegal fundraiser for former Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewage contracts with which it inflated costs
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption was operating smoothly.
Gilles Surprising, a former public works engineer, detailed it in front of the commission: in ten years, he received gifts from construction companies, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes totaling $736,000, in exchange for sewerage contracts for which he inflated them.
Other roadside officials have confessed to getting their legs greased by inflating bills by 30% to 40%, with fake extras.
Then an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately closing his eyes on a parallel budget feeding his crates with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal's first elected officials to sound the alarm bell.
Mayor of the arrondissement of Rivi<0xC3><0xA8>re-des-Prairies, to the east of the island, she rebels in 2010 against the sale of a municipal land bought 5 million dollars and resold... 1.6 million to promoters, in full real estate boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
From the investigation that will be finally put in place, she says that it "pulls on a wire to understand how the system works, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and pin the blame."
The process, she says, is “painful but positive.”
We're cleaning up the wound, but it would take a Montreal-specific investigation unit and a vigil to avoid the recurrence of questionable practices.
Just like we do the cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes that "officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars", but is especially concerned about the role of "elected people aware of the scheme", when they did not soak in the muzzle!
Estimating at 70% the share of dirty money in the financing of electoral campaigns in Quebec, he ironically: "I was told that it was just a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to $100 to the parties, but that will not change the situation, according to him: "As long as we do not strictly limit electoral spending, there will be dirty money in politics."
He advocates a complete overhaul of the system of awarding public contracts and party funding: "We cannot go any further; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house on stronger foundations, with more controls and laws."
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look at it in their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you have taken a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progression?
This can be explained by an individual awareness but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Every day, I get along with them.
The technical staff also helped me a lot.
On a daily basis, these elements push me to raise my level of play.
And in a match, it's easier.
Everything goes very quickly in football.
But I don't get hot.
From my debut at the INF Clairefontaine preform centre to my visit to Saint-Etienne, I have always progressed in steps.
So you take advantage of the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer’s recruits are used to playing very high-level matches.
They also know that every workout is crucial.
Which makes a player like me want to face and provide the maximum.
Moreover, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot about my position.
He is supported by assistants like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man of the situation?
Of course you do.
Ancelotti inspires respect among all technicians.
Today, he has no equal in Ligue 1 and is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has a lot of experience and has won a lot of titles with high-profile clubs.
He's been with some great players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had a reassuring conversation with him.
I was coming out of a series of injuries.
The confidence he gives me also explains my performance.
What do you think of PSG’s first season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took our place as the leader.
But we're still in ambush.
One of our major goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the 8th final with the way.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as we can.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we will have our say in the face of very good European teams.
We first want to finish first of our chicken, in front of Porto, to be able to receive in the 8th final return.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris needs to win titles and register in the long run.
Today, that is not the case.
Financially, the PSG is giving itself the means to make this project a reality.
In Ligue 1, not winning the title, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we really want to win this title.
Last season, we didn't go far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
We had a very big season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we are supposed to be champions...
But another team, Montpellier, made an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's the right one.
Even if big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to win it.
Do you think the media expect too much from PSG?
It’s normal to expect a lot from us given what’s been invested and the players we have.
We totally accept it.
Afterwards, when we win 4-0 at home against Troyes and we still find things to blame, it is sure to be a bit frustrating.
I wonder what people expect more.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona.
We're trying to set up a game project.
A team is built with time.
We proved in the Champions League that we could answer present.
Watch Manchester City, which has not been able to qualify for the 8th final for two seasons, have also made huge expenditures!
Looking at the amounts invested, we imagined you with 15 points ahead of the truce!
It was to neglect our opponents and the championship of France.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not well last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be able to have a smile by telling ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we ended up winning.
The PSG seems to be totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
All the better if we say there's a "Zlatan dependency."
This means that Ibrahimovic is very strong and has a lot of goals.
He came for it and he proves he's the star of League One.
He showed everywhere he went that he was a great player, a world star.
Within the group, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
This pushes others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to progress.
How did you experience the Euro 2012 with the French team?
Like a disappointment.
I was looking forward to participating in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from stacking up playing time.
I saw things over there and I came out reinforced.
Today, I am able to make good matches in the selection.
That's what I've been hoping for since my baptism with the Blues.
Lessons have been drawn from what has happened in Ukraine and we must be exemplary today.
What do you think of Didier Deschamps’ first months at the head of the Blues?
He has the results for him.
We are well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The selector is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the win.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
White had achieved his goal by qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues to Brazil.
Is the good null (1-1) torn off, on October 16, in Spain a founding match?
This match gave us confidence.
Everyone has fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never experienced a match like this in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
The opposite of current currency exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between stakeholders.
Moreover, as is often the case with these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, made up of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible to dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol in the manner of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files from pair to pair.
Approximately 200,000 transactions have already been recorded through 15,000 computers on the network.
A small thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a means of payment.
The price of bitcoin, after reaching a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to 2 dollars, five months later, before returning today around a dozen dollars (the prices are listed on the site bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing very impressive, compared to global exchanges in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as “the most successful virtual currency,” “competitive with the dollar or the euro,” and “similar to conventional currencies.”
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currency such as "credits", used to progress in a video game that you earn by playing or that you can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).
The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system.
But, each time, a central authority controls and processes the exchanges.
With Bitcoin, all the nodes in the network are both account holders, verifiers, currency issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually done between two email addresses in the manner of an email.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically by a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist well in the public ledger, broadcast throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers, and whose winner, a kind of provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding this additional line.
This is a phase of file hashing, that is, of transforming a large file into a shorter and unique digital footprint.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before "crushing" the whole.
The goal is to find the number that gives a particular footprint (many zeros at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the right one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the imprint.
If, for fraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphan because the two have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to one hundred millionth, which leaves some margin.
The difficulty of the challenge is also raised with each increase in computational power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
Websites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins in stolen deposits.
"The flaw used does not concern the protocol itself," says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real-money payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also mentions the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this flaw.
Heavyweight actors such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature.
Others, such as the WordPress blogging platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the ledger and showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins are not circulating.
In November, “giant balances” were launched.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of an educational book on this currency, believes strongly in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which come back cheaper.
The bearer also manages his identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement with merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
They just need to communicate an address that a phone can “photograph and recognize,” says Pierre Noizat, who ensures that it has thousands of users.
There is a general movement of questioning hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
“It will take time for Bitcoin to take hold, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicts.
The ECB, in its report, plans to reassess the various risks, now considered high, in case of success of this currency.
We left for Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the US are expected to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take back its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
It is mainly the Afghan peasants that we have punished by considering them as terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, the mutilated.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former refugee leaders in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse foreign armed presence, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes helped by local insurgents, they will no longer be when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almonds thanks to French credits, was in order.
The convoys of trucks and armored vehicles reached Kabul without being attacked, overflyed by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban airstrikes on Kabul by the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the country on fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
Their takeover of the country was then perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans have paid the price for the obscurantism of these peasants overtaken by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved nowadays.
Former mujahideen, Afghan government and current Taliban are joining in a desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main notables of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become businessmen, seizing government lands to resell them as land to be built to refugees returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge U.S. outsourcing contracts.
They have disdained themselves; most of them have not fought themselves.
People, as I have heard in the campaigns, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to enjoy the American breadth: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They sided with the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, they enjoyed the benefits.
Approximately 65% of the population is under 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one-fifth of the total population.
In cities, government schools are full of girls and boys.
It will be necessary to provide work for those young people who will no longer want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including armed opponents, are fond of mobile phones; television, and its Turkish pamphlets that present a modern world, are followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities that will be in charge of it be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned with reconstituting provincial militias, which will escape central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization, like the Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with strong presidential power, abolishing the post of Prime Minister that existed since the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially in the April 2014 elections.
But his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before.
No industry has been restarted, no dam is in good condition, no major irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
Priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country ruined by thirty years of war, government control over infrastructure would have been necessary.
It was rumored that Afghanistan possessed immense mineral wealth.
This only added to the feeling that the Westerners were only there to seize it.
Without energy to process iron or copper ore on site, or means of transportation to export it through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost left the copper mine of Mes Aynak, allowing international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to search the huge Buddhist site and remain the province’s most important employers.
It will also take some time for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are heavily dependent on imports and exports, to re-establish normal relations.
The departure of the French fighting troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aids: high school of girls, boys, department of French at the university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support to the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, in an attempt to "win hearts and minds" and to accomplish the impossible task of matching offensive aids and actions, a "civil-military actions" service of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), abolished in 2012, has carried out, and carried out, many actions of interest in a small French NGO.
These works, local laborers, were able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increasing arable land.
What will we leave as a memory, after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would help to improve local living conditions, which are very harsh in these valleys, often at altitudes above 2,000 metres.
The embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural achievements from local communities in Kapisa province.
In order for them to free themselves from the insurrection of foreign groups, which the farmers told me to wish for, a small, well-controlled and directly affecting civil aid would have to be maintained in their favour.
A Constitution with forceps in Egypt
This is a new poker hit from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which provisionally gives it full powers, it has decided to play its va-everything.
Taking everyone on board, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had given this Assembly two additional months to complete its work.
Egypt has been relying on a provisional text for almost two years, amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal fraud.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the President perseveres in his "autocratic delirium", continuing to "betray his word" and "trample the law".
On the part of its supporters, it is ensured that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible, by accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to renounce their plan to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way of regaining popular and democratic legitimacy as the protest rages across the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favor, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Especially since this use of a hasty vote stems from the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Either you vote for my text, or I keep the full powers", these supposedly having to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, with a large Islamist majority, voted on the text yesterday.
Most of the Liberals missed the call.
In mid-November, just before the constitutional declaration, they had slammed the door, believing they could not assert their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society had done the same.
In order for the necessary quorum to be reached, 11 people, replacement members, were added in haste yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Unsurprisingly, the articles were most often voted unanimously.
Commentators were amused by the fact that one of the only differences of the day was expressed around... the time of prayer, some members of the committee believing that the constituent's pendulum was poorly set.
The text, which was still being voted on last night, contains 234 articles.
Article 2 remains the same as the 1971 Constitution, stating that "the principles of Sharia law are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, hoped to be able to replace "principles" with "rules", which would have allowed a stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for other components of Egyptian society.
“Hypocrisy,” the Liberals answer, who see it only as a blow of communication.
For according to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
These include Article 220, which confers on Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular with regard to verifying the compliance of laws with Sharia law.
According to Egypt expert Sophie Pommier, it is worrying because "people called to speak are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
We can see the beginnings of a theocracy.”
The fears of the Liberals are further intensified by the fact that the next rector of this university should be much less moderate than the current one.
“At the moment, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not ulemas but academics, for some trained in the French system" tempers Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges "that there may be ambiguity around Article 220, because the terms used borrow from the religious vocabulary.
There is reference to the "fiqh" in particular [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question may arise in the future to what extent civil judges are competent to rule on it.”
Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is heavily criticized because of the extensive powers it gives to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced compared to what they were under the old regime.
Another point of contention: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the consideration of the Defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
Nor will the trials of civilians in military courts be banned, as demanded by human rights associations.
The latter also express their concerns about the text, which they deem to be a liberticide.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences on freedom of expression, in particular from the press.
In addition, no article any longer echoes the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by article 36.
The word was not included in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was due to speak on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state will parade them on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the World Center and a sea of brine await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land brings together the greatness of biblical truths, modern comfort and wild nature.
Arguumenty i Fakty has chosen five great reasons to travel to Israel.
Go adore the holy places
It is a must visit: the banks of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that anyone who enters these "baptismal funds" will be affected by the Divine Grace.
As for Galilee, it is the land of the miracles of Jesus: where the water was turned into wine, where Jesus walked on the water, where he calmed the storm, or where the fishing was miraculous.
It is at this precise place that Jesus appeared before his disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places, it is in Jerusalem.
Believers walk along the Rue de la Sufferance or the Way of the Cross (Latin: Via Dolorosa).
This path begins near the fortress Antonia (the praetorium), where the trial was held, then leads through the streets of the old town to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on the Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, then to that of the Stone of the anointing and the putting to the tomb.
This is where the Christian center of the world is located, a symbol of the salvation of humanity.
According to the Christian legend, the Monastery of the Cross is erected at the place where the tree used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified grew.
Jerusalem is also home to the most sacred place of the Jews: the Wall of Lamentation, which is the rest of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 BC.
According to tradition, people of different denominations leave small words there accompanied by prayers that are then answered.
Travel in height
Visit the ruins of the Masada fortress, an ancient refuge against enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 BC for his family.
These ruins are located on the steep rocks of a mountain at 450 m above sea level.
Only mountaineering enthusiasts can get there by their own means.
For the others, a cable car takes them to this summit full of history.
In the north of the country, between 1,600 and 2,040 m above sea level, is the ski resort of Mont Hermont which welcomes many tourists in winter.
A shuttle can take you from the foot of the mountain.
The ski slopes are a total of 45 km long.
The old belief is that pagan gods once lived on the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
This country is home to nearly 300 museums.
Impossible to visit them all during a single stay.
Here are the five most interesting ones that are really worth a visit.
First: the Museum of Israel located near the Knesset (parliament).
It houses the very ancient manuscripts of Qumran, or Dead Sea manuscripts, discovered in the caves of the Judean Desert, as well as nearly 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
See also: Tel Aviv Museum of Art.
It mainly exhibits the paintings of the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Acre, the Hammam Al-Basha awaits you with its Turkish baths composed of moldings of visitors and guards of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the only private Ralli Museum where you can admire sculptures of Rodin.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum or Memorial, located in Tel Aviv, which returns to the most dramatic historical pages in history.
The most tragic part is the children’s memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children exterminated in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and enter a total darkness.
Stars are glittering.
Then you hear the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned here.
Health and well-being
Israel’s three major seaside resorts are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, Red Sea and Dead Sea.
Each of them offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and giant aquariums.
Note: you can swim in the Red Sea even in winter, because the temperature of the water does not fall below 21° while that of the air can reach 23°.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and you can swim there all year round.
By the way, it is the most unique sea in the world: it occupies the lowest point on Earth, 417 m below sea level.
The azure water contains brine and very easily retains swimmers, even those who do not know how to swim.
The landscapes that surround it are of surreal beauty.
We come to perform a treatment based on salt water, lemon, curative sludge and to treat various diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes but also to simply relax.
Discover the secrets of antiquity
They are guarded by the old town of Tel Aviv, Jaffa, on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris that connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it is here that Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived a long and happy life here.
Tourists especially like to walk through the narrow alleys that bear the name of the zodiac signs.
It is said that if you touch the walls of the street corresponding to "your" sign, fate will smile at you.
In Jaffa you can meet newlyweds who have come to take photo shoots from all over Israel and even other countries.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theater, "conquering" the fortress of the Crusaders.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Note to tourists
If you’re going to Israel, don’t worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer dollars to euros, as they are easily exchangeable in shekels (today 1 dollar is equivalent to 3.8 shekels).
As for urban transport, it is mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tram and Haifa has the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and able to connect the lower and upper parts of the city.
It is almost an underground funicular.
The journey in all types of public transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1h30.
In Israel, Jewish tradition wants to celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets, shops and public transport stop their activities.
And the work week starts on Sunday morning.
Many cafes, restaurants and hotels serve only kosher food, which excludes pork, seafood, scaleless fish and dishes made up of both milk and meat.
It offers a multitude of dishes based on lamb and beef, soups and desserts based on coconut milk but also hummus, traditional Jewish pasta, various sauces, ground chickpea balls, falafels, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are a lot of well-fed cats that walk around haughty.
We can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars at night.
These cats love passing places and do not refuse to be entertained.
Renting a car varies by brand from $37 for 24h (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 a day.
Renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
Admission to the museum costs an average of 30 shekels.
The Language of Numbers
Three million tourists from around the world visited Israel in 2012.
They were mainly people who came to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 miles of Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land from January to October 2012, 51% more than in 2010, before the cancellation of visas on February 9, 2011.
"Who has the language, in Moscow goes": migrants save money to learn the language
As MPs and human rights activists debate what the mandatory language test law will do, fraudsters selling “fake” certificates have already made their appearance in the country.
Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal: to earn money to help their families stay at home.
Since December 1, a law has come into force and stipulates that every migrant worker will have to pass a Russian exam.
At the moment, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing, private services and retail sectors.
However, over time, the Federal Migration Service promises, tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will be necessary to validate the knowledge of the language, but also that of the history of Russia and the legal foundations.
You will need to validate your language skills in Russian to obtain and renew your work permit.
Only nationals of countries where Russian has the status of official language are exempt.
Persons who obtained certificates or diplomas of education before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are also not affected by this law.
Benefit, negative attitude and protection of rights
The network of examination centers will be under the auspices of the Russian Language Institute Pushkin, the University of Friendship of Peoples, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other higher education institutions of Russia.
Immigrants will be able to pass the exams in all cities of the country: more than 160 centers have already been opened throughout the territory.
This initiative to introduce reviews was supported by members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But, before the law comes into force, human rights defenders have already repeatedly asked the question in the press: what will it give?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for Russians and immigrants?
First of all, the representatives of the migration service answer, this will reduce the number of people suffering from "slavery at work".
Many talk about defending the rights of migrant workers, says the director of the office of the Russian Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
Protection of rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized selection system will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
The problems arise for migrants without a profession, without training, those who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates.
Without understanding the language, Sebelev certifies, the future migrant is destined to meet dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "travel" in an overcrowded cottage where he and dozens of his fellows will be tormented for months without food and without paper and will have to trim between 12 and 14 hours.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"They are promised one thing, and when they arrive, they are deceived, they take their passports, and they don't get the expected salary," said Tolib Charipov, head of the Migration Services Directorate for the work of the Tajikistan Migration Service.
Don't argue with me, Mr. Policeman!
However, many citizens of Central Asian republics who want to come to Russia to make money trust that they not only know the language of the country they want to go to, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language.
It is not their fault, of course, but their misfortune: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to follow even a passable primary education.
Indeed, their families do not even have enough to feed their children without talking about dressing them properly and equipping them for school.
As soon as they reach adolescence, these young people leave to make money as soon as the opportunity presents itself.
It’s hard when you don’t know the language, they say.
"You feel diminished and weakened."
Human rights defenders, however, note an important aspect of the language law.
The exams will only be for migrants who have legal status.
Without status, there will be no formal examination or work thereafter.
Yet, most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or Defense to Enter"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason? The administrative barriers and always these language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 thousand rubles.
And then, one can get a fake registration quickly for only 1,500 rubles.
The Russian police know that we have false documents, that we do not have a record, hence the cases of extortion.
"They ask us 100, 200 rubles, what to buy cigarettes, tea," Khuchkadamov, a Tajik national, told reporters.
“Do it quickly, don’t lick and buy yourself a beautiful work of art.”
From the first day of the language law's entry into force, it was discovered that migrant registration papers were not the only ones to be fake.
Several false certificates of language examinations have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Service.
Fake paper comes out of an ordinary color printer.
Of course, their new owners did not take them for nothing: every migrant who hoped to facilitate the task of examinations had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: this will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Representatives of the government and human rights defenders agree that the short-term goal is to protect the system from corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these “paper tips”.
The authorities can give migrant workers who have not been able to validate the first-time exam time to take language courses.
In addition, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve actively communicating with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not deal with the arms market
The share of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to tighten the law against the holders of civilian weapons.
Such is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: whether it is the shootings carried out at weddings or the killing organized by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, who killed seven.
The police want to ban the wearing of rubber bullets in public places and raise the legal age for obtaining a permit to carry a weapon by raising it from 18 to 21.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma's committee on security and anti-corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that amendments to the arms law would be introduced to the State Duma soon.
Not everyone is happy to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "clamping the screw".
An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various shooting centers, demand to abandon "this senseless hardening".
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, said Vasiliy Lesnikov, a lawyer and crime specialist for the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, over a period of six months in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in the police services, while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that the strengthening of civil weapons laws will not prevent criminals from getting supplies to the black market.
According to them, any weapon can be found today in Moscow at a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior maintains that it controls the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from the factory to the officer
The black market for arms is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are five, says Victor Baranets, a retired colonel who has served ten years at the Ministry of Education and the Headquarters.
Screenshot taken from a site taking weapons commands
The first is "military trace", that is, the weapons that were stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
“These weapons were stolen by Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians,” Baranets said.
The second type of weapons coming from the black market are those stolen from law enforcement by criminals.
Baranets explains that these are both weapons stolen from police stocks and those stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
Illegal pistols go on sale from military warehouses.
Many of these have often been subjected to explosions.
"Attested versions indicate that some fires were deliberately set off to cover up the deficit," the former military official said.
For Baranets, weapons manufacturers are there for something.
“We see private weapons factories that do not compete with the competition on the international market and that are flowing weapons on the black market, especially in Moscow,” one expert said.
One of the other black market sources is smuggling.
A significant proportion of guns and machine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is local production, sometimes artisanal, a mafia has formed and organizes the supply," adds the former military.
Where do the weapons come from?
The experts assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on the issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Study for Public Administration.
Experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and public data from arms portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers explain, come from the military and law enforcement.
Half of the weapons on the black market were found there "by fault of employees whose work is related to weapons," the report said.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places of military conflict, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% are from “ clandestine digs”.
A seller and consultant at an armoury who asked to remain anonymous assures that for a long time no one has bought the weapons found by these clandestine excavation specialists; they are too old.
Most often, according to him, sellers will look for new goods in military warehouses.
The person buys through a sign a unit, for example a TT gun.
We deliver it to him by passing the goods through a wire mesh.
"He transports it to the city and resells it for 900 <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> per unit with two chargers," he says.
"It's true that the police are aware of all the cases, so when crimes are about to be clarified, they make a purchase of control from the illegal arms dealers," the seller adds.
"Like in a luxury shop "
The seller and the buyer are usually found through knowledge.
I consulted websites, blogs, until a guy showed up and offered to come to the Begovaya station where someone was going to take me to a "corner" to bargain.
The price of the gun, they gave it to me on the spot
Victor Baranets as military observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, explains the seller. I know someone, but I do not trust him.
There are vendors in the markets, but there you also have to come and say, for example, "On behalf of such a person, who asked me to convey that his daughter lost a tooth".
Now I even buy a pair of American fists with the help of a person I trust.
He only gives them to me because he knows I won't give them to him.
Young people are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former militaryman Victor Baranets tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
According to him, the patterns have not changed.
We gave him a photo album in which there was "everything we want".
“I thought I was in a luxury store,” recalls the soldier.
There is no secret for the buyer, explains Baranets, we can try everything.
As a potential customer, I don't just buy, we go with the seller into the forest and set up a target.
“They let me shoot and when I’m convinced that the weapon is working well, we start negotiating,” the expert says.
A shop from his couch
Search engines display sites and groups on Vkontakte where you can buy weapons "for different uses".
For this, you do not need any documents and no one to meet.
"You just have to have a precise amount of money," it is written in advertising on the site "Buy a pistol or a combat machine gun".
Users leave their request and ask their questions.
And we sell to minors?
"Without permission, of course", asks the user "Ivan" (preserved spelling).
"Buy TT. Moscow", writes "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has spread a huge network of fake sites and is dumping people who want to buy weapons of war.
People swarm on food like hungry wolves and then they end up mining coal in Siberia

I have heard of this type of schemes: generally, the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take the lead.
The buyer makes the payment on the automatic terminals.
"In return, he receives a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden," said Dmitry Kislov, secretary of the Right to a Gun Association.
Victor Baranets says that by making a request on the site, you can find yourself without a gun and behind bars.
The Federal Security Service has spread a huge network of fake sites and is dumping people who want to buy weapons of war.
“People swarm around food like hungry wolves and then they end up exploiting coal in Siberia,” he said.
A Makarov for $100
The purchase of an illegal firearm, experts estimate, can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the association "Right to a weapon", one can buy a Makarov pistol for 100-300 dollars.
It will take about a month and a half.
It was taken out of long-term warehouses by the management of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to the official data of the Ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia overall decreased by 7% and amounted to 22.9 miles, while the cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and bombs decreased by 7.8%.
US: Employees of fast-food and supermarkets are on strike
Nearly a quarter of U.S. teenagers go through a cashier job at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests has risen against the low wages practiced by Walmart supermarkets and famous fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
At the moment, no one can predict whether this wave is going to expand or blow away quickly.
These actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing associations.
In addition to the modest increase in wages that basic employees receive at Walmart and in fast food chains, the organizers of the events want to get the creation of trade unions.
This sector is not currently covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week, after Thanksgiving, the “Black Friday,” at a time when a raging rain of balances taking over millions of people swept across America and sometimes sparked outcries.
On that day, some employees of the Walmart company, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their jobs to organize strike pickets with unions and left-wing activists in the company’s stores whose products are intended for consumers of the modest and middle classes.
Walmart sells everything from diapers to hunting rifles to car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
This is why many low-paid employees at Walmart shop only at their workplace.
The price and choice of products have made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its products cheaply, especially because of the low wages of its employees.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, for example the lack of forklifts or portable scanners.
Participants of the "Black Friday" protests were demanding an increase in wages, they complained about the fact that the price of medical insurance provided by the company had increased from 30 to 100 dollars per month.
For the base employee at Walmart who makes $9.5 an hour, that’s an amount he can’t afford.
Scientists at the University of California, Berkley, show that if Walmart increased the average wage to $12 an hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion.
That’s 1.1% more than what it currently spends.
If Walmart shifted the entire increase in wages to consumers’ shoulders, each race in the store would cost them an additional 46 cents.
They will spend only $12.39 more in a year than they do now.
Walmart supporters note with satisfaction that the protests took place in only nine states and did no harm to the group.
The "Black Friday" continued in stores from 8am to midnight the next day and Walmart sold over that period 5000 items per second.
His coffers made a total of 100 million transactions for "Black Friday".
Company spokesman Dan Fogleman said in an interview with the left-wing site Huffington Post that at least "less than five" Walmart employees had left their posts and that the protest was only a "com among so many" operation by the organizing union.
"Next client!"
The protests continued this week in New York and did not concern Walmart stores (in this progressive city, they are not very popular, which is why they are not yet established) but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald’s announces selling billions of servings and then they don’t even give you sick leave and pay you the work you’ve done honestly!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council Member
Currently, the minimum wage under federal and New York law is $7.25 an hour.
Fast food increases over time, but on average, its core employees reach $8.90 an hour in New York.
No one touches this town less than they do.
It is inconceivable for me to live with this amount in New York.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald’s after high school while living at their parents’ house.
Few people saw it as their main source of income or wished to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald's employees who complain that they have to live with this salary and sometimes have to feed their children with it.
On the other hand, on the forum of the Wall Street Journal there are comments that it is irresponsible to make children if you do not know what you are going to feed them.
Protesters who launched the movement Thursday at 6:30 p.m. near McDonald’s on 40th Street and Madison Avenue demanded that fast-food cashiers and cooks be paid at least $15 an hour, more than double the current minimum wage.
They also called for the creation of trade unions in the fast-food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing and punishing union protesters with harassment or dismissal.
However, administration seldom simplifies their lives.
For a trade union, grabbing fast food remains a difficult task, and that, for concrete reasons.
One of the main is the extraordinary rotation of the staff.
They don't agree
Other tumultuous demonstrations were held near several other fast food chains.
The highlight of the protest was the mid-day rally near McDonald's in Times Square with the intervention of several local Democratic politicians, including Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council, who said, "McDonald's announces selling billions of servings and after they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you the job!"
The protesters were backed by other prominent New York Democrats, including mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio who said that "we must all support fast food workers so that they get a fair wage and the economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves.
The New York Times characterized this event as the most important fast food event in its history.
But only a few hundred people participated, not counting that they were not all fast-food employees, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is difficult for the moment to say whether this spark of mass movement will make small ones.
“At the moment, we can only fool the brain on average.”
Recently, fans of new technologies have become accustomed to perceiving augmented reality through special glasses.
Initially, it was Google that unveiled its current model this summer at its annual conference and in November we learned that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, it appears from the interview with the director of the interactive 3D technology group of the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, that for the scientists of this company, the glasses are already of ancient history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, by creating open virtual spaces.
- Could you tell us in a few words what your research group is doing?
- We work on the interaction between man and machine and at the same time we try to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole has remained for the time being pixels on a flat screen and sometimes touch screen.
We want to look 5 to 10 years ahead and guess the radical changes that will happen with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect because everyone is interested in ordering by gesture.
- What does the future hold for us?
- Although the Kinect has rendered the physical interaction, a lot of things take place on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has been improved (the system receives more data), but the performance, for now, not really.
We're trying to change that, and we're working on real 3D imaging systems running on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We need to bring the computer world out into ours, into the physical world, make it more tactile.
For this, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user, but also the space that surrounds him.
Thus, we will be able to complement the real world with virtual objects in a more practical form.
And to begin with, let’s get rid of these stupid virtual reality headsets!
- What do you think of the voice command?
She's appreciated, but isn't she overestimated?
We cannot say that this is the panacea: the question of confidentiality arises because we do not always want to inform others of his actions or intentions.
In fact, each type of interaction with the computer is good, but each in its niche.
For example, in order to control the devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought of gestures, not broad gestures, but rather discrete, restricted gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a hand-carried bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is currently large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed command, for example: gesture + voice.
- What do you mean?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass you this can?
You would do it with words and with gestures.
- Usually, I'm just talking.
- Oh, it's gonna be hard to recognize.
- So, do you want to force users to adapt based on what the machine may or may not do at any given time?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think that very soon we will have to work on developing new types of sensors that will allow us to better identify human reactions.
These can be laser sensors, for example, they produce a fairly good resolution in depth and this is very important.
- If we are interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what do you not like about modern cameras?
Are they lacking in resolution, depth or something else?
- In principle, it is the current generation that we rely on in our work on 3D recognition.
It would obviously be good to get about 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Compared to this last point, all current technologies are quite good, this adds work to algorithm designers.
It is necessary to keep in mind the resolution along the X and Y axes, but also Z.
Speed also matters a lot, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and 30 c/s is really not enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our Redmond lab, gave the touch of the sensors a regular processing delay of between 1 and 100 <0xCE><0xBC>s, with the current sensors being closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how this affects the interaction of man and machine.
I would need a device of this type in my work, but not needing to touch, to have more frames per second.
Shouldn’t we increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second, a receiver of the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually a typical sensor of the visible field.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
Many cameras could solve this problem...
Or worsen it by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to the Kinect, play with the camera curve and see how it could help define locations.
As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that from a perspective of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the platforms with the most perspectives?
- Of course, walking all the time with a smartphone hands up is not practical but here is what I think: the best option would be an augmented reality "transient" that would allow you from a cloud platform to switch from glasses to the smartphone.
Glasses are a very personal device and that is what makes them strong (personal elements are the only ones you can see) and at the same time their weakness: augmented reality from glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is no longer accessible only to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the mere mortal.
There is a problem on which opponents of this idea point the finger: there is no tactile sensation!
The hands feel nothing.
What are your group’s responses to this challenge?
- In my classes, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth might very well be the addition of tactile sensations.
At the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as an image support.
It perfectly records the pressures!
But there are also technologies that are really meant to attribute palpability to these "air images": for example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed to a specific point where the finger is located and which gives you the feeling, for the moment still weak, of a breath of air on the tips of the fingers.
There are also bracelets worn on the wrists that affect the nerve endings of the fingers, they are also a working axis with perspectives.
- And you tried to fool the brain?
Make him think that he feels what he should normally feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
There is still a task below which it will take a long time to get hurt: the way to make someone who is physically in a very small space believe that he is walking in an almost infinite open space - we are working on the concepts of running mats (nothing to do with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also volleyballs.
At the moment, we only manage to fool the brain on average, there are still many years of work left.
This is what makes work on virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in the absolute state of fertilization.
The reign of taste and not culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "The Petersburg avant-garde" dedicated to city dwellers who are at the forefront of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already welcomed prominent actors of the artistic scene of St. Petersburg whose achievements go beyond the city border and who have found recognition in Europe, having been known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extroverted painter Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, this rather bearded man, all dressed in red that you can meet near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or in the trendy parties and varnishes.
Kirill Miller’s paintings always bring the crowds together, no matter where they are exhibited.
He is one of the fundamentally social and philosophical St. Petersburg storytellers, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is a prominent representative of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the inhabitants smile and puts them in a good mood.
He recently took in his hands an organ of Barbary and he became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg since he had matured enough for this difficult role of his existence, his philosophy and his image of Bohemian.
- Kirill, why are you walking around the city in red and not in yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose red as a tailor specializing in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the image creator and society.
Even if in society, everything that is not gray arouses aggression and negative agitation.
But my provocations are meant to start the discussion.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
And when did you realize you had to be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Nevskiy Palace of Culture where my works were.
I realized that was my way.
Then the wave of old unofficial painters had passed and the new ones, free, in my genre, were misunderstood.
I began to make friends with the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina who gave birth to "Puchinskaya-10" and then there was no longer a wave.
I am interested in theatre, fashion, music, all genres except words.
It was important for me to find myself in the center of St. Petersburg's culture where the best creative forces must come together.
In 1995, I took place in Pouchkinskaya-10, which was home to a musical and artistic club, a bohemian club, the home of the Petersburg bohemian.
Many were born there: The NOM, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arrive with the project "The Van Gogh Ear".
Chnour and his friends sang easy play-back songs in molding jerseys, among them Igor Vdovin, now a fashionable composer.
When the band started performing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg ran a lot of shows before the Hali Gali era.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and that’s when his great career started, but his training and basic education, it’s with us that he received them.
Gallery "D137", Club "Griboiedov": these are repercussions of the Artistic Clinic.
Our employees went there as usual.
I am a hero of the last century, of the time when culture meant something.
In 2000, a survey was organized in the press: it was the prize "The personalities of our city".
I was named “Painter of the Year,” and that’s when my reign came to an end.
It is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, one can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a very strong topicality and sharpness.
I'm going to have a planned exhibition, "The Russian Museum Through Clowns."
Clowns belong to a timeless category.
Before I was a social worker, today it hurts and it’s scary to be like that.
But with the clowns, everything disappears, the tragedy falls.
I like the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and mandatory disguise.
Today, it is the dress that matters, we are interested in the external mechanism, but not inside the person.
Maybe we can't give him a hand, but we have to spit on his torso.
And the lie will be erased by disguise.
We recently saw you play the organ player of Barbary, a cultural city must have this kind of hero.
No one but me can play it.
- But maybe commercial art can also be beautiful?
- Today the commercial art must be neat, delicate, liquory.
A disintegration of culture is taking place.
Before, people were divided into herds, the supporters of the bohemian loved one thing, the negates another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollar bill to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you're going to like.
Each star has 100 fans.
- But several thousand people come to see Stas Mikhailov!
- It's people we threw who come to see him, it's the sexual and social side that goes.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles will not come and ultimately it is less management, money, everything is wasted.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to fool them, not to spoil the experience.
When I was young, I painted paintings that a collector hung next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with the paintings that are usually those that we paint at the end of life.
Today, ideas are often confused.
It is said: there is the spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do with it.
I am a representative of yesterday’s culture, I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused money precisely for painting.
I am for this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the official of culture.
But not everyone can work in culture.
Under the rule of the good tsars, it was not so, the tsars did not understand culture well, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the good experts.
In Moscow, there are good consultants today.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they are excluded, because we need higher experts who will correctly evaluate these experts and make a way for them.
Currently, it is the "kingdom of taste" that is flourishing.
The same Erarta, but they differ in the sense that they honestly say that they do not take all contemporary art, that there are painters who must find themselves other museums.
- For you, what is St. Petersburg?
- St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a ground for it.
And on our stones, art has a hard time growing.
We need a cultural ground and we have more writers than readers, that’s bad.
In Europe, there are many curious people who are going to see exhibitions, concerts.
In our house, this layer is very fine.
We need to make art as fashionable as it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project realized with the support of the St. Petersburg Scholarship
Birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a deadly asteroid.
Space shuttle caravans with Earthlings on board set off in search of a rescue planet.
In order to save humanity, a big question arises: how to continue to make our species live in weightlessness or on a rescue planet?
I don't think there's much choice.
There are actually two real planets that can be conquered, even if only by hypothesis.
"It's about Venus and Mars," said Vladimir Sourdine, a researcher at the P.K. Chternberg State Astronomical Institute (GAICh).
If on Mars the conditions are more suitable for life, the temperature at the surface of Venus is 500 .
You can only live there at very high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
We began to focus on the issues of reproduction in space by focusing on the flora.
Half a century ago, we were doing experiments on plants.
Four generations of small peas grown in orbit did not differ in any way from terrestrial varieties.
Then, insects were put into orbit, small drosophilic breeding flies.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to see how a weightless embryo developed.
At the exit, you get a perfectly normal chicken.
Then the problems begin.
"The problem is that the chick has to find a support, it has to get on its feet and start moving," says Vladimir Sychev, the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP).
When no support was found, the chicks roared disorderly.
And after 10 hours, the newborns saw their instincts completely atrophy.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would simply die at the end of four days.
"We squinted their eyes twice, then we gave up, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," explains Vladimir Sychev, noting the failure of the experiment with chicks in space.
The last biological "miniature ark" with animals was sent into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, the biosatellite " Bion " will only ship species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats sent with their fetus into space.
In principle, nothing supernatural was discovered.
"It was still biosatellites and then it's the only experiment. We have to do this kind of research," notes Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats gave birth to their offspring.
However, it is not yet possible to carry out reproductions directly in space.
It's not a big deal.
By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to realize their sexual instincts.
Unlike animals, humans are capable of this in principle.
The Homo sapiens possesses abstract thought, it is able to create a suitable emotional background.
This type of experience is not carried out for ethical reasons.
Women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the female organism is what humanity has most precious.
Our seagull flew away and no one on Earth could tell if it would hold after a flight into space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the theft.
“No one answered that question,” said Vakhtang Vatchnadze, a retired rocket and space engineer.
In June 1964, just one year after her flight into space, the first female cosmonaut Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a little girl.
The child’s father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, after being twice in orbit and even working in an extra-vehicle environment, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk persists.
We have few, even very few cosmonauts who have had nothing and give birth to a healthy offspring after long flights.
"And if they are longer, it poses a danger even during the flights in orbit," concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of Russia, Valeriy Poliakov.
Yet humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravitation.
Laboratory of Hydrology of the Cosmonaut Preparation Centre: obligatory stage of preparation for flight.
Here, in zero buoyancy, cosmonauts train at extra-vehicle exits.
Water mimics weightlessness.
If for adults, the water is comfortable but yet a foreign environment, for infants, this is their real element.
Small amphibian men seem to confirm this: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
As the baby develops about 9 months in the lymphatic fluid of his mother's belly, it is easier for him to get used to the water afterwards.
This is basically logical, because from his birth to his first bath, it happens only 2 weeks.
“It’s very little to forget,” explains infant swim instructor Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for the child who has just been born weightlessness is a more natural state, the woman needs gravitation, a force of weight.
In weightlessness, the muscles of the abdomen, pelvis atrophy very quickly, the ability to push the baby is lost.
All right, let's ignore that by relying on the birth simulators.
Of course, you can prepare a childbirth in a special room, the woman will manage to get it out.
"And then?" asks Valeriy Poliakov to invite him to reflect on this complex question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravitation.
If it does not feel the earthly attraction, the body does not form the skeleton or the muscular system.
One cannot dress an infant like an adult with a special combination for workouts.
It will simply be deprived of its vital needs.
"And this experience that we would consider in this case in imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will result in the return to Earth of a child with a disability, completely unfit," predicts the Director of the Committee for Bioethics of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in space is still part of the theory.
However, over time this will become a reality when the Earthlings travel in their shuttles to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their space-born offspring.
The head of the ISC (Higher Institution for the Control of Public Finances) said: "the control of pseudo-independent work (in Czech "<0xC5><0xA0>varc system ") has failed because of politicians.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and quality legislation, but is lagging behind in its application.
This is what Miloslav Kala, the vice-president of the Higher Institution for the Control of Public Finances, said in an interview with Aktualj.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its enforcement must be fair and, in my opinion, that's what's missing from us," Kala said in his commentary on the current situation.
A joint inspection by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
He cited as an example of abusive practice Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as' approach to the " <0xC5><0xA0>varc system " .
The Prime Minister recently stated that the SDGs would not harass contractors with controls, so is this allowed or prohibited?
"The law must be enforced in one way or another, so if it prohibits anything, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority to go inspect to demand compliance with the law," Kala said.
At the meeting of the Supervisory Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you mentioned a Czech-German project in which the public procurement laws of these two countries were compared.
What was the question in concrete terms?
This is a parallel control that we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation provides for how to manage public procurement and specific national legislations, as well as a proper practice follow it.
We have put all this together and although this control procedure is not yet complete, very interesting differences have appeared to us: generally speaking, our legislation is perhaps "severer and better quality", however, according to some parameters, the practice as such is better in Germany.
This therefore confirms that it is not enough to continuously develop more and more detailed rules, but that it is necessary to devote ourselves to the implementation of the law itself.
How can this project help you concretely and what does it mean for you?
This kind of joint control should help us to stop trying to clarify the laws, lowering and improving the thresholds, when it does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means getting the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But lowering the thresholds of the markets will not necessarily achieve this goal.
It could be that this system is so overwhelmed by paperwork, that those looking for flaws will find far more opportunities than if the threshold had remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems regarding the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an institution similar to our ISC or a different way of organizing?
As far as institutions are concerned, similarly to the ISC, the Bundesrechnungshof operates there, which is similarly organised, it also has a slightly different board, but these two institutions basically do the same.
The competences are also, to some extent, similar, but with a nuance in relation to our system: Germany is a federal structure, so it also has such account prices at the level of the different Länder.
The BRH can only control federal money, which in our country corresponds to the resources of the state.
The public funds managed in our country by the regions and municipalities, are there controlled at the level of the accounts of the Länder.
As far as national legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
I would not like to make a general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas Germany is often referred to as a model, but we certainly cannot say that it does better in all areas.
Maybe it's because they have better inspectors?
No, probably not, but I repeat, I do not have comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country, which we regard as a model, is also facing a number of problems.
Otherwise they would have no advantage in cooperating with our institution, right?
As far as national legislation is concerned, what has the amendment to the Public Procurement Act meant for you as an institution, are its effects already being felt?
Since this amendment came into force relatively recently, it does not yet have an impact on our control operations.
As we do a posteriori checks, we have to count on a certain delay.
Our observations concern only, for the time being, the process of preparing for future checks - we have launched a new "mismanagement risk detection" instrument with which we have screened nearly 14,000 public contracts - there these changes will of course be felt, because the thresholds have been changed as well as the conditions for certain types of follow-up tender procedures and so on.
Do you therefore consider the adoption of this law rather as an advantage or as an added burden for the administration?
I think this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm that.
The problem that may arise is that these rules become more stringent and that it is not possible to comply with them.
Already under the previous regulation, the provider (e.g. the regional council, in the case of regional operational programmes) forced controlled subjects to accept that any violation of market law meant a breach of budgetary discipline.
So is it really useful to make the law more stringent in this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack the system or abuse it but not punish those who make formal mistakes without consequences on the decision-making process.
Such a system will put more pressure on the administration.
So what is the solution to get out of it?
Let's look where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the ODS was not going to harass entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called <0xC5><0xA0>varc system - what does that mean?
Is the <0xC5><0xA0>varc system prohibited or allowed?
The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits anything, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority from acting to inspect and demand compliance with the law.
He can declare, "We're going to change the law and allow it," but he can't say that we're going to act as if nothing was.
The law on contracts contains relatively strict rules on the formalities to be completed, precisely to protect the call for tenders.
But it is also tragic that a bidder is eliminated solely because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be just and that is, in my opinion, what is lacking in our country.
The roads are frozen in places, but most of them remain practicable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and also snowy.
However, the network remains largely practicable, in some places with increased vigilance.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the area of Karlovy Vary, the roads were walkable this morning, but in places frozen and also snowy.
Temperatures have fallen and fluctuate between -5°C and -10°C but they should rise slightly during the day.
Snowfalls have ceased in the region and only a thin layer of snow remains in the plains.
However, the ridges of the Metalliferous Mountains (Kru<0xC5><0xA1>né hory) are covered with about 30 centimeters of snow.
According to data from the Regional Road Maintenance Service, visibility was reduced due to fog.
The R6 expressway and national roads in the region are now easily accessible.
However, vigilance remains, for example, on certain bridges whose lining can be frozen and slippery.
All departmental roads and third-class roads, including mountain roads, are also practicable.
There are still some remains of frozen snow on some of their stretches and in places crowded by traffic.
Especially in high-altitude areas, drivers need to be more vigilant.
Regions of Pardubice and Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové
The Directorate of Roads and Highways reports on its website that some roads in Eastern Bohemia are threatened by ice formation and that traffic-laden snow can be found on roads in mountainous areas and at altitudes.
Road maintenance services warn drivers against the risk of ice formation in areas of the Pardubice region located at an altitude.
There may be ice in the vicinity of Lan<0xC5><0xA1>kroun, <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Orlic<0xC3><0xAD>, Poli<0xC4><0x8D>ka, Svitavy or Vysoké M<0xC3><0xBD>to, mainly on departmental and third-class roads.
The I/43 and I/34 roads around Svitavy were chemically treated.
Snow is mainly found in the Giant Mountains (Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e) and Eagle Mountains (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>nou and Trutnov, a layer of snow covered by traffic is present on the roads in the areas located at altitude.
In Eastern Bohemia, the weather will be mostly dry, mostly clear, with occasional cloudy skies.
The wind will be weak and the temperatures will generally fluctuate between -3°C and +1°C.
Pilsen (region)
The roads in the Pilsen region are now practicable, although in some places there is a need to be more vigilant and to adapt its driving to weather conditions.
It freezes this morning, temperatures range between -3 ° and -9 ° C.
After the last snowfall and the subsequent cooling, some communication channels may be frozen in places.
Drivers can expect to pass through fog areas, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is according to information from the Regional Road Maintenance Service.
The D5 motorway can be used with almost no difficulty, however, road maintenance services recommend increased vigilance between km 80 and 131.
The lining of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some sections can be frozen in the Pilsen-Sud district and in the Tachov district.
The departmental and third category roads are wet and in this case the warning against frozen sections applies.
Drivers should be vigilant, especially on less frequented roads in the <0xC5><0xA0>umava region.
Olomouc (region)
Drivers travelling to high-altitude areas of the Olomouc region must now count on a thick, soft layer of snow on the roads.
This layer remained on the so-called "<0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo" pass and on the road towards Videlsk<0xC3><0xBD> k<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE>, after chemical treatment operations.
Snowfalls that night forced road maintenance personnel to go to the field; according to road services, it fell more than three centimeters in the district of <0xC5><0xA0>umperk.
In other parts of the region, most roads are easily accessible.
" On the heights of the district of <0xC5><0xA0>umperk there are snow remains.
Drivers driving towards Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k should expect to meet at the pass called "<0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo" a thick and soft layer of snow ", the head of road maintenance services of the district of <0xC5><0xA0>umperk told <0xC4><0x8C>TK today.
Their colleagues from the district of Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k also visited the site during the night; according to the latter, after chemical treatment, the roads are now cleared and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the district of Olomouc the roads are easily accessible, but in the district of <0xC5><0xA0>ternberk drivers should be careful in sections in forest areas with wet roads.
Regions of <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem and Liberec
As early as this morning, North Bohemia’s road maintenance services reported several difficult sections.
According to police data, in addition to some places covered in snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice na <0xC3><0x9A>stecku is closed.
Temperatures will remain below zero at lower altitude, so snow and ice should remain on the roads. In the plains, especially to the south-east of the Central Bohemian Plateau, there are, on the contrary, no problems and the roads are usually dry.
No traffic difficulties have been reported at the moment.
Road maintenance services have reported the presence of ice, especially around <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>t<0xC3><0xAD>.
According to meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and melting snow during the day, clear sky and frost during the night.
There are also reports of difficult conditions on the national road 13 at the border between the regions of <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem and Liberec from the main traffic routes.
The closure of the traffic between Telnice and Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice is due to branches of trees that have curved under the weight of the snow until reaching the roadway.
<0xC5><0xA0>imon Ornest said: “In concert, we want to collect positive energy.”
What do you think about the fact that in less than a month it should be the end of the world?
This is just one of those alarming news, the kind of traps we like to fall into.
In our band The Tap Tap, we are laughing rather and saying that we are the only group able to collect a remainder of positive energy in order to push back or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December you set up a completely unique project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present this project in more detail to our readers?
This is a charitable action that we have been preparing for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Maya calendar announced for December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The day before, on December 20, three concerts will take place simultaneously, in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will practically end when the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati, which is in the Pacific Ocean, on a time zone 12 hours ahead of us.
Who's got this idea?
At first I think it was my idea, then we designed everything with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want to think together, with the public, about the state of the world that we leave to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Maya calendar, we created a collection of unique items, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, by buying them online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The band The Tap Tap with other performers also recorded an anthem against the end of the world entitled " End of the world cancelled " (in Czech " Konec sveta zru<0xC5><0xA1>eno ").
It is already very popular on YouTube, will it also be heard at these charity concerts?
Of course, all in the end, finally, if we succeed and the end of the world does not take place ...
It will be sung simultaneously by all the performers in all three concerts.
The anthems will also join at some point as part of a completely unique live broadcast of Czech television.
The lyrics of this song were written by Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Han<0xC3><0xA1>k who also plays the main role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X also sings there...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other Czech show-biz personalities, due to the fact that we organize many concerts and charitable events...
We strive to involve them intensively in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it amuses them.
What will be the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world?
To equip the Studeo training center which is accessible to people with reduced mobility and which we have been working on in the framework of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, with the association Tap, and this for six years.
Teachers regularly visit the students of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v Institute and offer them activities that interest them and amuse them.
Students themselves do not have the means to get to classes, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, we will transfer this project to a new independent building.
Will several music groups and performers perform on stage at each of these concerts?
According to what criteria did you choose them?
We have tried to develop a program that is aimed at all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan B<0xC3><0xA1>rta, The Tap Tap, Mari<0xC3><0xA1>n Bango and Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Such<0xC3><0xBD> will perform on stage.
Full details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you also preparing for other "mega events" of this kind in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time as part of the Prague Spring; there too, we will surely prepare a quality program with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year at the Czech Republic’s home in New York and personally, once in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalistic, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not so terrible that it seems at first.
We have five members in the electric chair whose equipment must travel in the hold, of course we also pack a lot of luggage and instrument boxes....
So far everything has been more or less always going well, <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we came from recently, everything went smoothly.
Through your travels abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of accessibility for people with reduced mobility, public attitudes towards people with disabilities, and so on.
What have been your experiences so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than at home, we have just witnessed in Moscow that the east is still only in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very poorly accessible to people with disabilities; there, it is not yet common for a person to move alone in an electric chair in the city center.
They do not yet consider it obvious to give priority to a person in a chair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there too, an association trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities is being created.
How do we still have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are a lot of things we are still late for...
It is important to note that improvements and improvements are always dependent on the efforts of the individuals concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with a severe disability to travel alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
It is not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities actively participate in social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are rather at the forefront of progress!
Public respect and accessibility are one thing, but the situation will really start to change when we have among us famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers.
At the moment, these are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The band The Tap Tap is currently very popular, let's go back a few years, what prompted you in 1998 to create this band?
I started working as an educator at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, where I found myself surrounded by many young people ready to invest in something.
And since I am a musician myself (I play, among other things, saxophone), with a colleague, we created a music activity.
And then, over time, as our moderator L<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D> says, we lost a bit of control of the situation (laughs).
Success has only happened in the last few years, if I'm not mistaken?
It's true, creating connections with well-known singers and actively working to promote the band has helped us.
We understood that if a work is not visible, it is as if it did not exist in the background.
Thanks to European Union grants, we can also afford to have quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Did you aim to reach such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt there was potential to change things.
The show business is full of things that copy each other.
In a way, it makes sense: anything new is accepted with caution and it lasts a long time.
Rare are the original projects, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally pity, it is natural ...
But pity is totally useless, because people with disabilities are not suffering beings, abandoned by all, that we must take pity on.
They are people who can live a full life and thrive, provided they have the necessary means of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities achieve something, it’s not just an advance for them, but for society as a whole.
Isn’t your success also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be uncompromising in many areas and demand some discipline.
But I think that's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and, when they realize that they have to come to rehearsals twice a week, attend preparatory classes and spend a lot of time on the roads for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in every group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap group currently has 20 members.
How many of them were there in 1998?
A single one, L<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>.
We're an open group, people come and go, we can't do anything about it.
Our doors are always open to those who want or would like to join us.
This will be the case on the eve of the planned day of the end of the world, on Thursday, December 20, 2012, starting at 9 p.m.
This action will take place in Prague in the Incheba arena, in Brno in Fleda and in Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of twelve bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual relay when the band’s song “End of the World Cancelled” will be sung together.
The purpose of the concert is to raise funds (CZK 25 million) to equip the multifunctional training center Studeo, which is located in Prague in the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute.
The price of a ticket to this concert is 400 CZK, admission is free for children up to 12 years old, pre-sale of tickets is open to Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of this agency, it is the second member of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had started working closely with ESA in 1994 and in the following years participated in a number of ESA projects.
The road from Poland to space, however, started much earlier.
Already before the Second World War, passionate Poles worked on spaceflights; they did not always meet with understanding.
I would like to mention, for example, the conference of A. <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, on 6 December 1933, during which he presented ideas from his avant-garde work entitled "Introduction to Astronautics".
The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) left the listeners cold and years later <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize in France for his work "Introduction to Astronautics".
This doctor Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) subsequently became a great propagator of astronomy and astronomy.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote numerous books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a world-renowned propagator of astronautics, his contribution was rewarded in particular by the fact that his name was given to one of the craters on the lunar surface.
As early as 1925, a draisin was built in Poland to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project are known.
It is also not clear whether the rocket should be used to propel or brake the draisin.
The only information known about this draisine is that of the press at the time.
Beginning in 1933, Polish artillery began to dedicate itself to rockets.
The research was conducted by the Kom<0xC3><0xB3>rka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustav Mokrzyckiego.
It appears from the preserved documents that this research had reached the testing stage.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the search was interrupted.
In 1937, the plans for a photoelectric fighter rocket, designed by the engineer Rohozi<0xC5><0x84>ski, appeared in the specialized press and the following year was published the book "Rakieta - torpeda voietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by an author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
These two projects were intended for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all projects for the use of rocket technology were carried out by the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee ("Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy"), which coordinated all the work.
This committee had been established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war ended its activities.
After the war, other works devoted to aeronautics were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, a company is mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the journal Probl<0xC3><0xA8>me, which contains four more detailed articles on aeronautics.
In one of these articles, written by Professor M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society dedicated to astronautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that the field of space research had a future.
In early 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) made efforts to join the International Astronautical Federation (created in 1951) and in the fall, the PTA became a regular member of it.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice-president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He remained in office until his death in 1959.
From 1956, the PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the RM meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first model, the RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
This rocket with a range of 1800 meters had a length of 80 cm and weighed a little less than 5 kg.
An improved version, RM-1A, was subsequently built, and during the summer of 1959, flight tests of the two-stage RM-2 rocket were started in the Bledov desert.
This rocket had a length of 1.4 meters and probably weighed 11.5 kg.
The next prototype should have been able to carry out concrete scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have a range of up to 14.5 km and be used to observe the wind at altitude.
But in 1963, all development work was stopped.
The Meteor-1 rocket, developed between 1962 and 1965, was the successor to the first RM-type rockets.
This rocket, designed with two stages, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a volume of 0.4 litres, while in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 litres and in Meteor-1C it was 0.62 litres.
The maximum range of all these types of craft was 37 km.
In the period 1965 - 1968, Meteor-2 rockets were developed in the aeronautical institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km.
Subsequently, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also worth mentioning the entry of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
As part of the Interkosmos program, Poland also participated in space exploration on artificial Soviet satellites, and in 1978, pilot Miroslav Hermaszewski became, after Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut of this program.
The repeal of the Public Utility Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Utility Works Act.
This decision has raised a heated debate in public opinion.
It is undoubtedly interesting to examine this issue from a broader point of view.
Economic systems oriented towards liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalisation, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
Concretely, this means that the various economic entities and national economic systems are constantly in conflict with each other.
This is the result of the principle of free trade and free movement (without limits) of private capital combined with unbridled financial speculation.
The considerable differences in the price of labour (salaries) create a tension on prices.
It is necessary to put under this term the following meaning: a producer strives by importing goods sold at a low price to resist economic competition by "making more expensive" the price of the competitor, with the aim of removing a greater share of the market and thus increasing its own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transferring production abroad, buying cheaply, or disappearing. The result is significant unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment it generates, the social burdens of the State necessarily increase.
This whole situation intensifies the perfect ill-will of the entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus to compensate for the economic and social damage caused to the whole society by this race for profit.
This situation is at such a point of public awareness that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital in different economies lead to a situation in which the governments of different countries are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially lower the social level of their own populations in order to attract foreign capital to their homes.
In other words, governments put their own people at the mercy of private capital without taking into account social collapse.
This is manifested mainly in the amendments to the laws in force.
The aim is to economically force its own population to accept the dictation of private capital prices, especially in the field of wages.
This is due, on the one hand, to a system of economic constraints in the event of long-term unemployment and, on the other, to the restriction of workers' rights in the field of labour legislation.
This results in increasing poverty and deepening disparities between the rich and the poor.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, there have been public food distribution points for the poor for years, which cannot meet their needs with their own work.
There are already millions of such people.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it is becoming quite common for employees to receive such wages that the state is forced to pay a supplement in order for them to reach the vital minimum.
Such a scandal has been updated, for example, in the case of employees working as auxiliaries in the federal parliament.
The economic measures of almost all the southern EU Member States undoubtedly generate a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as was the case in the nineteenth century) or to live with private wages of misery, on the margins of society, in the hands of the poor.
The question here must be asked: where will this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will pass from one country to another; this capital may not come either, or else a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turk, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or an African will continue to work for a fraction of a European wage.
This also applies to the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media say, to get tired of it, that the state cannot make capital investments in its own economy, which the directed economy leads to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital fiercely defends the idea that the state cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory interventions.
It is then necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence, and even today does not, according to its own selfish interests, direct politics and, by the same, the whole state.
The answer to this question is undoubtedly yes.
The proof of this is that there is an almost omnipotent lobby in every state.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, through the granting of mutual benefits, in legislation, where everything is condemnable but not punishable.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, the situation is such that due to the lack of financial resources, national ministries delegate the drafting of laws to law firms closely linked to the industry.
These bills were then passed in the Bundestag.
The totality of power does not come from the people, as Western-type constitutions state, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is evident that liberal-oriented democracies are now quickly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his book entitled "The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the Time of Caesar and Pompey": "The State was long ago in full turmoil and the functions were attributed by violence.
The bribes, the favors obtained illegally, and the stones and swords were also used to obtain these posts.
The under-the-table and corruption proliferated without limits and the people went to the elections with absolutely sold votes C" ... ... "Honest people did not seek to get any functions, it resulted once the state remained 8 months without consuls".... ' It really began to say that the remedy to this difficult situation was a failure and autocracy.
In conclusion, as in antiquity, the present society is based on the preference of personal profit, without regard for the interest of society as a whole.
In essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and assert the interests of society as a whole.
The result is, today as in the past, a decade without precedent for elites, without any effort to carry out profound reforms.
We must therefore look for the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the unscrupulous liberalization of the economic systems of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
In the current state of affairs, the disappearance of these systems in favour of liberal-type democracies can be seen as a kind of pause before a new stage.
The fact that the current elites are completely unaware of the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future losses of human lives, the humanitarian and social crises we are now witnessing, as well as the crimes against humanity as we know them from ancient and recent history.
The repeal of the Public Utility Works Act is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both at international and internal European level, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is indeed systemic.
The solution consists of socio-political reforms, which will strengthen state capital investments in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the position of private capital monopoly in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
“Nothing will ever come out of violence and never will,” Sting says in the song, “Fragile,” whose main line of the chorus is “let’s not forget how fragile we are.”
“If my sons didn’t want wars, there wouldn’t be any,” said Gutele Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild on her deathbed in 1849.
Following the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions have risen.
Some take the side of Israel, arguing for its right to self-defense and placing the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, invoking the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and considering Israel as a terrorist state.
I do not want to reflect on the question of who is guilty and who is the victim, in its waves of repeated killings; all in all, the current inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, were born in the present political situation and did not experience the beginning of the violence.
I would like to offer readers a view "behind the curtain" on the one that benefits mainly from the tensions that have already lasted for more than 95 years (since the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a small part of the Middle East.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available for study, others emerge from my own understanding of the one, or more precisely the group of individuals, which is the main instigator of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is first and foremost the history of a struggle for power.
In every epoch, we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individuals acted independently or whether they owed their actions to someone who directed their actions based on pre-defined goals.
We must admit that we are living in a time when global wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration generating certain powers has not been possible in a single generation.
Among families possessing an astronomical wealth is particularly distinguished the Rothschild family, which could be considered the head of the octopus (I do not know if these families still have a leader but I do not exclude him).
Very little is written about them.
Of course you do.
As early as the 1990s, they acquired the first global news agency (Reuters) in order to put an end to the establishment of links between their name and serious criminal acts in which they were involved and which had always meant for them a strengthening of their power, an increase of their fortune or both.
They own major holdings in almost most of the world's central banks and prepare or wage wars against countries in which they do not yet have such holdings (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries was 7, after the invasion of Iraq by 5, after the overthrow of the central bank of the Gaddafi only by 4, meanwhile the
Anyone who tried to stand up against this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Rothschild Bank of America's central bank status and began issuing his own money (government, I mean well) during the civil war and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
JFK began issuing clean money and wanted to dissolve the Fed, he was assassinated in 1963, MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 while he wanted to sue the Fed for triggering the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their thirst for world power led in the years 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a freemason initiated at the 33rd degree, being the highest level.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great state monarchies of Europe, the second was to abolish colonialism, especially British, and the third was to reduce the world population between 1 and 0.5 billion individuals (such a number of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create a single universal religion (ecumenism and apocalypticism, being nothing else).
The method used by the clan of the richest families with the Rothschilds at their head is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - the order following the chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to an aggravation of the situation (see the creation of the EDF to prevent the recurrence of crises such as those they provoked in 1907).
After successfully triggering the First World War by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, Habsburg's heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by provoking the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended abruptly with a German capitulation without economic and military justification (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of Tsarist Russia) and it was followed by the fragmentation of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
For an easier start of the Second World War, the bankers allowed the politicians to create a situation of latent conflict: on the one hand, they imposed on Germany enormous war reparations, thus generating the conditions for a radicalization of the impoverished masses (they then suffice to place a sufficiently energetic and prone national leader, showing that there is no need for them).
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of whose branches aspires to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration mentioned above laid the foundations for a massive emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first frictions with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on either side.
The Second World War broke out; it is difficult to appreciate whether Hitler broke the chains in which international bankers had initially held him; or whether all he did was planned, however, the fact is that the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the basis for the acceptance of a Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way that war reparations imposed on Germany were at the origin of World War II, the foundation of the State of Israel ignited a fire that could provoke a third world war.
If the international bankers manage to trigger this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during World War II, the first victim of the fighting, this time as well as the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like an immense laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but internationally (it is enough to see how people are bitterly divided between supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is a victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where one wrong generates another wrong in a circle of endless violence and where the greed of some individuals and their desire to gain power over the whole world is found at the origin of everything?
We have to make the difference here between the ordinary citizens of Israel and their leaders, because, as in our country, the international bankers offer people only their own candidates in elections.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to the international bankers, who does everything in order to trigger a war with Iran, which could, due to the accession of this country to the cooperation organization of Shanghai (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.) expand all the world's control and that's given to the world's conflict.
As David Rockefeller said in 1994, “The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order.”
In their idea, the New World Order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of finance aristocrats are served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which every newborn is implanted at birth an electronic chip making him a totally controlled being.
"May they compel all individuals, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to wear a red iron mark on their hands or foreheads, so that they cannot buy or sell anyone who does not bear the name of this ferocious beast or the number of its name.
It must be understood that he who has common sense counts the numbers of this ferocious beast.
This number refers to the man and it is six hundred and sixty-six."
The movie Argo: when everything goes wrong, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of Islamist students stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, which had supported his regime for several decades.
The situation did not offer the US administration a positive outcome, it could not, in fact, abandon the Shah, because it would have seriously shaken the confidence of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was not able to obtain the release of the hostages.
It was a hard blow to the prestige of the United States, aggravated later by the fiasco of the attempt to free the hostages by force.
The kidnapped diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their fate aroused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment in the United States.
The Iranian debacle contributed greatly to Jimmy Carter's defeat of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo, by actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offered a small victory to America.
Just before she was busy, six employees escaped from the embassy.
After complicated journeys, they found themselves in the residence of the Ambassador of Canada.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran thanks to a rocambole cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a film crew who came to make spots for the filming of a great sci-fi show.
Combination of genres
Exfiltration expert Tony Mendez's plan required Hollywood's collaboration.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialized magazines reported on this film project, press conferences were organized and a fictional production company had real offices.
The details of the operation remained secret for a long time, the film being based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is an unusual combination of several genres.
This is partly a realistically designed political thriller but also a "caper movie", the story of a successful hit, of a betrayal - such as, for example, in the Ocean's eleven, twelve and thirteen trilogy.
The atmospheres follow each other: documentary-style sequences of Tehran (in the subtitled sequences are presented iconic photographs of the time of events and how, thanks to these photos, these same situations have been transcribed into the film, there are no big differences),
lighter passages of Hollywood, treated with irony and a bit of exaggeration,
and then scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the hallways and on the phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in a remarkable way.
As a ridiculed actor, he became a respected director and his acting ceased to evoke ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the dark policeman "Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and the thriller "The Town" (2010).
It is also Affleck's first film not to take place in his hometown of Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that placed his first films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of atmosphere in Argo where the role of Tehran is "held" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, during the reconstruction of real facts; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive for its clarity which also suggests the confusion and unpredictability that occurs when suddenly, in a given place, a page of history is written.
Affleck and his collaborators get a similar effect in the fictional scenes (the fake film crew in the Tehran bazaar).
Too many actions in too many places
The director had to settle for a subject offering in fact few thrilling scenes, in the cinematographic sense of the term.
It does very well, it sometimes adds some elements to the reality and there, the result is not always so elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at Tehran airport is ruled out by a phone call in America and the pursuit on the runway are quite drawn by the hair).
The weakness of Argo lies in its dissipated character, due to the need to show too many events in too many different places.
While it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role as Hollywood co-operators, their characters would have deserved a bigger place and they are not, far from that, the only ones in this case.
Affleck's film lacks a bit of dramatic tension, it shows itself with moderate interest, enjoying the realization and retro style of the 70s.
He trains the spectator, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a history still, in a certain way, unfinished to this day, and as an illustration of the exaggerated character of the representation of the secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, he does the thing.
Rules for Inflating Balloons, Bananas and the Circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually conducts a public investigation into the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to launch the settlement contest or ideas from the most absurd "EU workshop".
"The fact that the EU is considering, in recent times, adopting a quota of 40 per cent of women for the management of large European companies has been the reason for our decision," Patrik Nacher, the organiser of the survey, told the Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo newspaper.
Among the absurdities mentioned, there is already, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
However, up to now, women have benefited from life insurance rates because, objectively, they pose a lower risk to insurance companies.
People can report until the end of the year any other such incredible idea of "the EU workshop".
“The vote will take place before the end of February 2013,” Nacher said.
Among the EU's controversial regulations are, for example, the obligation to add bio components to fuels, which has harmful consequences for the environment, or the prohibition to use reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small amount of a dangerous substance, or the directive on the size of chicken cages.
Critics have also been criticized in the past for prohibiting the use of the term "butter to roll" or for withdrawing from the sale of conventional bulbs.
Quality bananas should be 14 centimeters in size.
The European administration often reacts under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose demands are usually defended in Brussels by a state or group of states (so the Czech Republic is currently imposing the demands of its banks by threatening to use its veto right).
The interests of pressure groups are also, for example, at the root of the fact that in the Union bananas should not be less than 14 cm in size or have an "abnormal curve".
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it only harmonizes non-homogeneous national standards that complicate trade.
Fruit and vegetable standards have been relaxed despite opposition from some States, claiming that existing directives lead to food waste.
The first prize may be awarded in this survey to last year’s EU regulation that inflatable balloons must include a warning that children under the age of 8 should not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU referred to a U.S. survey that balloons are, among toys, the leading cause of child deaths from choking.
A similar restriction applies to children under the age of 14 when it comes to blowing in fair trumpets.
At home, too, we have strange ideas.
The following rule concerning European officials themselves is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of this theme to Greece, anyone with an official function within the EU cannot use the name "Macedonia" and must, instead, speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the association "Laissez-faire" of liberal economists, the server Bankovn<0xC3><0xAD>poplatky.com named in this investigation, in addition to some absurdities mentioned above, the EU regulation concerning the volume of food reserves on the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for food reserves that could be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volumes fixed for canned mushrooms and risked a heavy fine.
The organizers of this survey found it interesting to pay money to some countries because they do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant to apply for grants.
These ideas, however, do not originate from Brussels but from Prague.
"The fact that we don't have a sea is a handicap.
We will ask the European Union for a refund," said the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) in the autumn of 2004.
He argued that, because of our wheat production, and following the so-called "interventionist" purchases, the state had found itself with full stocks that it had to then export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from the ports.
In the end, the European Commission responded positively to Czech demand and organised a call for tenders for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
The grants for grants were proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development under the direction of Minister Pavel N<0xC4><0x9B>mec (US-DEU) and were specifically intended to be used to draft applications for grants granted by Brussels.
The EU declares: “bizarre regulations are rare”.
While the regulations are often criticised in the Member States, according to many experts, the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the effectiveness of the Union's functioning and its overall development are rather worthy of praise.
More serious, for example, according to experts, is the problem of using EU subsidies for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with strengthening European integration, but that were imposed by the Member States during the budget negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other countries of the Union, must fight in Brussels for the right to use specific denominations for these traditional products (wrestling from which it does not always come out victorious) evokes strong emotions among the Czechs.
If after six years of battle against the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name "Olomoucké svara<0xC5><0xBE>ky", as for the name "Tuzemsk<0xC3><0xBD> rum", which dates back to the 19th century, our producers had to replace it with the name "Tuzem<0xC3><0xA1>k".
Only products based on cane sugar alcohol, and not on beet sugar, can bear the name rum.
In the official EU list of registered products, we can find today in the company of world-famous cheeses such as Feta or Gorgonzola, massepain from Lübeck or Parma ham, biscuits from Karlovy Vary ("Karlovarské suchary"), carp from Poho<0xC5><0x99>elice and T<0xC5><0x99>ebo<0xC5><0x88> ("Poho<0xC5><0x99>elick<0xC3><0xBD> lebo<0xC5><0x88>").
Pardubice Spice Bread ("Pardubick<0xC3><0xBD> pern<0xC3><0xAD>k") and cakes called "Ho<0xC5><0x99>ice's Cornets" ("ho<0xC5><0x99>ick<0xC3><0xBD> trubi<0xC4><0x8D>ky") can also be proud of their community brand.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur, says Senator Okamura
Senator, how do you come up with the idea of running for president?
It's not about being a senator or a president that matters to me.
If everything worked out smoothly in our country, I wouldn’t be a candidate anywhere.
But I can no longer stand to see how the country has been looted over the last twenty years, that thieves are not under locks and taxes and retirement age are increasing.
I didn’t have the ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something that I don't like, then I try to bring a solution for it to change.
And since I am over forty years old and an independent member of no party, I have no other solution to influence the situation than to run for President or Senate.
You entered the Senate but you quickly set off for the Castle (N.d.T.: seat of the presidency).
Do you not turn your back on those who elected you?
I've always said that I'm going to fight for the castle based on the results of the Senate election.
Subsequently, I made it clear that if I were elected a senator, I would run for President.
My goal is not the function, this is just an instrument that allows me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the broadest mandate.
The problem is not only that as a nation we squat at the bar or in front of our television station, but it is also that we trample on those who are trying to bring about change.
In addition, the press breaks people’s reputations and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, it has been said about me that I am suing journalists or that I was the adviser to Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek.
Let's get to your visions.
You have started the struggle for the Castle with as a battlehorse the themes of material and criminal liability of politicians and retroactive tax returns over twenty million [CZK].
To do this, you need to change the law.
As president, you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When, as a citizen, I pressed for tourist guide activities to be a liberal profession, I gained ground.
The problem is politics: when someone arrives from the left or right with a good project, it is deliberately refused and it delays the citizens.
As an independent member of no party, I have a much better chance of getting the support of all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of being able, without categorization and dogma supporters, to take from each party what is best for our country and implement it.
Do you see yourself as a left or right-winger?
From a Czech point of view, I feel like people are placing me on the left.
For me, whether it's a little left or right, it's not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we move forward.
What matters to me is not that people are on the left or on the right, but that they gather people together.
I always support any solution that contributes to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or the SDGs, and I act equally impartially against bad ideas.
Do you get angry when someone tells you that you are a populist?
But doesn't what you said prove it?
When you develop a business plan in a company, you also have a certain optimal purpose and vision.
You're trying to get closer to it.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I am talking about have been applied by the world and recognized experts have spoken about it.
But without Parliament’s support, you have only slogans left.
You won’t survive long in politics with this.
Do you think that if you go to see people and talk to them, you will, for example, succeed in imposing material and criminal liability?
I don't have a choice.
I need to convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to rally them to my camp in order to impose it.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to broadcast live on television my request to the presidents of the parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal liability of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
They should then possibly explain why they don’t want it.
When there is a strong personality who will identify abuses, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take, for example, the election of the president by direct vote, it was obtained thanks to the pressure of public opinion.
I confess, without hesitation, to be an amateur, and not a genius or an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I've just started politics and I'm trying to get majority support for my program.
I'm trying to move things forward alone, and if it doesn't work out, I'll stop in six years and go back to the private sector.
It's kind of like Okamura had to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that only one person can make a difference, which is why I went to a number of personalities to ask them to also run for the Senate election.
I met Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
At least I supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencov<0xC3><0xA1>, who revealed the oil fraud.
I introduced myself because people are really dissatisfied but now I hesitate.
Sixty percent of the people did not vote and what they did mostly gave their vote to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have elected a Senate that can hardly impose change.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example, the direct election of mayors and prefects of regions.
Are you planning to start your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check if each potential member's past is spotless and then I don't have the financial means.
I also don’t have money for my presidential campaign, I only have twenty thousand on my “transparent” account.
Don't you have any money?
You're talking about tax returns, what's yours?
I estimate at about 60 million the value of my personal property.
I have in Prague a plot of land worth 25 million, an apartment worth ten million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of art worth about ten million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a <0xC5><0xA0>koda Superb worth 1 million and a few million on my account.
By the way, I own an Aston Martin, because it was a kid’s dream: I’ve always loved James Bond, who drove a car, was gallant with women and fought against evil and abuse.
You drive in Aston Martin, you have a heritage worth 60 million and you don't have money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but you don’t want to invest your own money in it?
It's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for this campaign.
Should I be indebted?
I've already invested two and a half million in the campaign.
The fact that I do not have any sponsors shows that my program does not arouse much interest.
I don't have to pay for this campaign out of my pocket.
My campaign expenses are generally covered by the salary I will receive as a senator.
But I couldn't live on it, for example, paying my son's English school, which costs 30 thousand a month.
If my only goal was to make money, I would not run for election.
So you are going to continue your business activities in order to be able to live?
Didn't you say you'd deafen your business?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I have partially reduced my activities.
For example, my assistant will take over the direction of the travel agency in the spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live on something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were an entrepreneur?
I won and I continue to win between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I would end my business.

The architects of the MVRDV firm prove that true adventures are not just a matter of imagination. To be convinced, it is enough to contemplate Spijkenisse and the newly erected mountain of books - 2 photos
"I think this building is funny, it's very futuristic, finally something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby on the lower side of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computer scientist at a large nearby company, tells us, "Yes, it's actually beautiful, this building."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has the Internet, an iPad and e-books.
No one wants to go to one of those sleazy libraries anymore, right?
Spijkenisse, a dormitory town that has nothing attractive at the gates of Rotterdam, holds a rather special record.
The municipality of 80,000 souls has the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to give back some neurons to the brains, the city decided, a few years ago, to contribute to the general culture and reproduce the seven fictional bridges that appear on the euro banknotes in the form of beautiful small miniatures in painted reinforced concrete.
The success of the cultural offensive remained limited.
This is how the city authorities realized that there was only one way to regain control of the statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas, from Rotterdam’s MVRDV architect’s office, master of bold stick diagrams and creator of often cynical buildings, accepted the project with his usual phlegm and entered the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a curl on his face.
And while the jury members were still looking, puzzled and shouldered, Maas, the confronted, stacked his books of choice in order of size to make it a pyramid, and ended his speech supported by activist arguments by one: "Dear common!"
Here it is, my proposal for Spijkenisse’s mountain of books, or as they say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million mountain erupted.
The building is part of a revitalization project that also includes an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and a few semi-detached buildings and houses for a total of 50 homes.
At the beginning of November, the mountain of books received the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project was selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This is how this dull little town, which until today had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and a town hall of awe-inspiring ugliness, whose white facades invite us to think that they are home to a dairy, has been enriched by a contemporary architectural work.
Most importantly, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Road to Reading
First impression: Eldorado of the book under cheese bell.
Sure, an elevator takes you to the heart of the massif, but the real joys of reading and architecture open up to you as you walk the floor of the building to discover its topography.
The interior entirely made of glass is bright and clear, the Dutch brick floor and elegant street lights speak unequivocally the language of municipal public squares.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We are already looking for public benches, dogs and little boys and girls who play ball.
And everywhere books, books, and more books.
"Normally, the library rays are located along the facade and in the middle is a large and dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal," explains Willy Maas.
We have completely disrupted the classic spatial configuration and opened the reading spaces from the inside out.
The interior of the mountain of books has been neatly arranged: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the center for the environment and the technical center of the building.
A particular beauty lies in the black rays of the library, which are sometimes boards, sometimes balustrades, sometimes staircase ramps.
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
Even hardened architects and building engineers don’t want unknown materials.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials,” says Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.
This is how we once found ad hoc waste from agriculture in a Frisian farm.
In the Netherlands, one millimeter thick synthetic membrane has been used for years as a substrate in greenhouses and fields.
It's cheap and it saves time.
The thin membrane is used for one or two seasons, then it can be discarded.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, into plates of a thickness of four centimeters.
Under the effect of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes color and transforms into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, the smell of which evokes both a new car and sports shoes.
At the top of the 105 steps is the mountain top.
At the end of almost 500 meters, the literary café offers us a breathtaking view of the city, but also Dutch croquettes and ficus in pots.
The latter create an atmosphere, but they mainly contribute to the maintenance of the ideal humidity level of the literary mountain.
Gifts for the New Soul
“It’s incredible, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model project in terms of ecology,” says Trouborst.
The temperature of the building is regulated by geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books lies beneath a glass bell, the sun illuminates the interior only for a short time, even on sunny days.
The thick wooden beams mounted crosswise relative to the glass facade serve as a sunshade, intercepting much of the rays.
The ambience is very pleasant.
Fully automated blinds take care of the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the aforementioned septic computer scientist, has already risked entering the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
Cynthia Bogarde, a professor of traditional Chinese medicine, even describes the Boekenberg as Spijkenisse's "finally found soul".
A few weeks ago, at the inauguration, every citizen was invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This measure helped fill the void in the library that was not yet fully stocked (today it has 70,000 pounds).
The concept is a success.
The rays are overflowing from all sides.
Winy Maas once said, “There is nothing worse than a half-empty library.”
“I believe that our invitation has created a certain relationship between each citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's just for decoration."
This is how MVRDV has reached the master discipline that is called, in professional jargon, "the creation of an identity".
Spijkenisse has written a new page of literary history.
Although she may seem young and uneducated.
Finally, it is a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a bigger role."
Germany chose to abstain in the vote on the admission of the Palestinian state.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on U.S.-EU relations, this decision puts Berlin in a difficult political situation.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany announced its intention to vote against the Palestinians' request for observer status at the United Nations.
But then she chose to abstain.
What's wrong?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve of what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, Berlin must be cautious, as it has special relations with Israel.
But I also think that it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to assert its independence, but was not too critical of Israel.
In the Libyan uprising of March 2011, Germany also chose to abstain in the vote on the establishment of an air exclusion zone.
Finally, NATO imposed this measure.
Is it difficult for Germany to adopt a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason for this is that Berlin is revising its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy so to speak defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
Moreover, the lack of a coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans are fighting on several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still trying to find this role, but are on the path to a "more normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as in France or Great Britain
What does the term “normal” foreign policy actually mean to the Germans?
It shows a willingness to adopt positions independent of those of the United States and European partners, including on national issues.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, that is, by its exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are to some extent different from those of other great powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced Germany's position on the Middle East conflict and its abstention in the United Nations vote?
Germany first has significant opportunities in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must be careful not to hit the public opinion, but also the elites of the Arab countries.
This is without a doubt a decisive factor.
However, I would not attach too much importance to this, because it is not an exclusively unilateral relationship.
But this is in any case a decisive element in German strategic thinking.
Does Germany undermine its relations with the United States by opting for abstention in important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think that Europeans and Americans understand the German position perfectly.
That is why I believe that the fracture is not so serious as it was in the case of the Libyan question.
Perhaps even Germany will be more respectful of it.
Indeed, Germany has thus demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international actor and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, opinions on the Palestinian initiative are diverse.
The United States, on the other hand, announced its veto with a clear voice.
Do the opinions differ between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences because of the American domestic political scene.
I believe that the Obama administration is secretly showing a great deal of understanding towards the European position.
But given the political configuration of the country, the government cannot, of course, defend its position publicly.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not so great as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is far from overflowing with enthusiasm for Netanyahu’s policy.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners, on the other?
I don't think that makes it any easier for the Germans.
Obviously, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, but today it is not.
They cannot therefore fit into a broader political line and must assert their unique position.
This is what they are currently doing in the matter of the euro.
In my opinion, Germany will take on a locomotive role in the future and will push Europe to adopt a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, especially because of relations with Israel.
This question has always been delicate.
But in my opinion, the Germans are well aware of the fact that they have to play a role that further marks their independence.
Does Germany see itself playing a major role on the international stage, does Germany just want to play a key role?
Or does she still have difficulties in assuming leading roles?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still uncomfortable for it and, for obvious reasons, the country is still struggling to play a bigger role.
If we look, for example, at the euro crisis, we notice that every time Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German sentiments are heard.
It doesn’t make things easier for the Germans.
In fact, it is always the same problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
She has to deal with very diverse neighbors and opinions, and it is not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European policy is only diminishing, but at the moment, the EU is not filling this gap, so who remains?
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
And even if they do not like it, even if it is unpleasant to them and if they are only less appreciated, it is life!

"Mark Protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are well-known brands around the world.
Armani Polo... what is it really about?
Behind this name is a trademark officially registered in China, but which has nothing to do with the original company.
The trade mark thus enjoys such protection that the company bearing its name cannot lodge a complaint.
And even if she could, she's not sure she'd gain cause.
“It’s becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China,” said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing’s law firm specializing in property rights violations in the Far East.
Every week, a new file comes to my desk.
Imitators only need a few extra letters to register their trademarks.
Thus, instead of Gucci, we record Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, we record Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied, such as Puma, the manufacturer of sporting goods.
Pattloch opens a folder containing the recordings made with the Beijing Trademark Office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company filed the Zegna DF Puma brand, a name that the firm artificially created by taking part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a well-known fact that the Chinese have become the world champions of copying and intellectual property infringement.
In large cities, there are multi-storey shopping malls that sell practically only counterfeits.
However, Pattloch’s cases are different: his clients charge him with tackling the fact that the Chinese trademark office officially gives Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese speak of "Bang Mingpai", a parent brand.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
It is with this term that women are referred to who marry rich men.
Chinese authorities say they have nothing to complain about.
“It’s bad for business, we have to fight this trend,” Pattloch said.
"The brand is sweetened, the singularity disappears, the damage to reputation is enormous."
Financial losses and legal costs are in the millions for the sectors concerned, especially in the case of expensive flagship products.
According to the market analysis company CLSA, China represents, with an annual volume of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 billion, the third-largest luxury product market in the world and the fastest growing.
However, it is not easy to delete dubious registrations from the trademark register and these procedures are expensive.
These can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch refers to the trials in which the court rejected the complaint, because after a long time, the denomination criticized had become a "market reality".
Pattloch explains that if the complainant is unlucky, he may even be forced to pay money to the plagiarist, as he would have harmed his brand in China.
In this area, it is sometimes the law of the jungle that dominates.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal battle against construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the same company that had just bought the concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
This is the reason why the Chinese can use an emblem that looks like the Mercedes star.
Geely, the Volvo buyer, had previously used a blue and white logo that resembled that of BMW. The conflict was settled and Geely had to modify it.
The fashion house Lacoste had lost to the plagiarists in Hong Kong and Singapore who had reoriented the famous crocodile’s gaze in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
The CTMO trademark office in Beijing, however, admits to experiencing some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, last year the office would have moved from a "emergency situation in the work process to a normalized one".
Thus, the number of unprocessed opposition proceedings would have decreased by 22 per cent.
Nearly 57,000 cases of this type would have been closed, representing a 75% increase from the previous year.
However, 81,500 procedures are still pending at the office.
Acting is Expensive
As is often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
According to the office, this is a record and this means that China is at the top of the ranking for the number of new deposits in the world for the tenth consecutive time.
This would also apply to the total number of legal marks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the office would have accounted for 1.8 billion yuan of registration fee.
In other words, each record reported an average of 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle costs much more, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg illustrates.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting a Chinese plagiarist.
Of course, the Germans were able to get the illegal manufacture of vehicle components suspended.
However, the imitator was able to maintain his Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
“It’s our fault, because last names cannot be protected in Germany,” says Hanno Wentzler, CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trade mark office therefore rejected the objection of the Munichers.
Freudenberg certainly won the case in the following two instances, but the opposing party continues to fight until today.
Vigilance is required
Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, believes in a positive outcome of the trial and praises the professionalism of the judges.
Nevertheless, he adds: "the procedure is long, arduous and costs us a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to assess internal costs, and the Archives Service has even had to review the records of the past 100 years in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg had even in vain offered the opposing party a “large six-figure euro sum” to settle the dispute.
"That's what it means to us," Wentzler said.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to overwhelm Europe.
This would be the case if imitators from that region ensured the exploitation of unprotected trademarks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to file the Freudenberg name in Germany for a shoe and leather production company.
The company had long since abandoned this sector, but it was still able to prevent the deposit.
Wentzler adds: “Vigilance is at stake.”
Pattloch and he advise German companies to exercise great caution in their trade relations with China.
It is not enough, according to them, to rely on international trade mark law, foreigners should rather "record also in China everything that is likely to be protected", as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, the costs can be much higher than those of registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle in the last act of his legal drama, the company would have to pay license fees to the opposing party for the use of his own name, as Wentzler explains.
Otherwise, we would lose our place in the market segment in question.
World AIDS Day: kicking, singing, helping
The Imbongi choir repeats in Heidelberg, and the AIDS orphans of Swaziland rejoice at their arrival.
Here is the story of a link that crosses much more than a distance of 8,733 kilometers.
First, the foot is tapped: cowboy boots, sneakers, women's shoes and men's moccasins look for rhythm by hitting the floor of the foot. Very soon, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then the voices of the singers amplify slowly - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - they take over, enchant and follow each other.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor almost loses his canvas shoes when he conducts the orchestra with his gestures of wild flexibility.
It’s Monday night, the Imbongi choir repeats a new song in the music room of the Heidelberg Institute of Medical Psychology.
Fifty singers between the ages of 23 and 69 have come, from the geneticist in human medicine to the man at home.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each chorus player has different lyrics, all in a very exotic language: Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some parts of Swaziland.
Being Helped to Help Yourself
UNAIDS, the United Nations programme to combat AIDS, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are affected by the disease.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 infected people.
In addition, more than 40% of the population is HIV-positive.
180 AIDS orphans from the village of Esitjeni have found sponsors in Germany thanks to the association "Voices for Africa".
70 of them attend a secondary education institution.
For <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 or <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 less, you can become a sponsor.
This sum guarantees the child money for school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal at the gogo center.
Imbongi means "storyteller" or "singer of praise" in Zulu.
No one can speak the Bantu language fluently in this region, but everyone can sing it.
For almost 10 years, the choir has been repeating songs in this foreign language that it has brought to Germany to keep returning to its native region: South Africa.
Because at 8,733 kilometers bird’s-eye from Heidelberg, in the northwestern Kingdom of Swaziland, is Esitjeni, the village that depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
40% of people affected
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some live in modest straw or land huts and most of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans, because HIV took their parents away.
In Esitjeni, one can observe on a smaller scale the ailments that overwhelm Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
The population almost never accepts male circumcision, a measure that, however, guarantees a proven reduction in the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of Swaziland's population carries the immunodeficiency virus and it is not uncommon to die in the mid-30s.
During a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir was able to discover the village. The Imbongis especially saw many children on the street who lacked not only parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothes, education.
In a poor country, without a school diploma, there is simply no prospect.
In the beginning, it was just a few people who personally committed to paying a few euros each year in order to be able to send a child to school and offer him a hot meal per day.
But barely a year later, the choir founded "Voices for Africa", an association that has since dealt almost professionally with the AIDS orphans of Esitjeni.
Facts About Sexually Transmitted Infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.
Common STIs are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
Pubic lice and gall belong to parasitic STIs.
Which groups are mainly concerned?
Syphilis and diarrhea often occur in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that sexual contact between men causes at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia-related infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungal), blenorrhea and the human papillomavirus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany; however, some 20% of new HIV infections are seen in this group.
In young people, the rate of chlamydia-related infections is significantly higher than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections concern young people aged 15 to 25 years.
In addition, in Germany, the human papillomavirus is common among young people.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to report all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis cases has more than doubled in 10 years: the figure increased from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has decreased.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one tenth from the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual illness?
Infectious diseases can cause abscesses in the genitals, urinary pain, white loss, pain in the lower abdomen, as well as the appearance of buttons and warts.
However, they do not regularly cause any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How to protect yourself?
Condoms may reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%.
The reason for this is that the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through lubricating infection or close body contact.
Experts therefore recommend that anyone who frequently changes sexual partners should undergo regular examinations.
Most rapidly detected STIs can be cured and late sequelae can be avoided.
Thanks to sponsorships, donations, but above all to the funds raised by the choirs thanks to their voices throughout Germany, the funds accumulate.
"In total, we have already sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," said Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident woman who always gets what she wants, manages the money from Germany.
She also ensures that the orphans are well accommodated, at one of their grandmothers, for example.
The gogos, so called the old Zulu women, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them accommodate up to 14 orphans, offer them a roof and make sure they go to school every day on time in their uniforms.
The orphan who no longer has anyone is welcomed in a safe place, at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as well as the two cooks who prepare meals every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" created a sewing school and allowed the construction of two chicken coops. With the help of the American health organization PSI, the association organized an HIV screening test for many residents.
This is not self-evident, because even though the disease is clearly visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A King and His 14 Wives
“AIDS is a real taboo,” explains Annette Lennartz, “because it’s a subject that touches on sexuality.”
It is quite curious, coming from a country whose king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
These state-sanctioned customs, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV observed in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country.
However, condoms are found on every street corner, Annette Lennartz adds, “but almost no one uses them.
The culture is different, flesh for flesh.”
In order to promote cultural exchange, Imbongi choirs travel together every two or three years to South Africa and sing songs full of nostalgia, courage, confidence and black identity that many of the top inhabitants of the black continent still know from the time of apartheid.
The bus filled with whites singing in the African language is such a sign of recognition that it not only generates good mood and joy, but sometimes also tears away a few fearsome border guards.
The bus always takes them to Esitjeni, where the choirs visit their nephews.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the Ezulweni valley.
"Go to Esitjeni, you will find light there," say the people there.
And after a journey of 8,733 kilometres by bird flight, back to Heidelberg, in front of these choirs who kick their feet in the rehearsal room of Bergheimer Straße, we also find the light.
NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has reported evidence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice layer could reach 20 meters thick.
The US space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is the closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as explained by three studies published Thursday in the journal "Science".
The Messenger probe reported evidence of ice cover in the region of the planet permanently immersed in the shadows.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters up to 20 meters.
The water probably comes from comets or perhaps asteroids that would have hit Mercury.
However, no one makes a link between the discovery of water and the hypothesis of a presence of life on the planet, explains lead scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help understand how water and other vital elements of life arrived in other regions of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, such as small interstices through which one observes the infinite.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a "planet," according to the new definition of the 2006 International Astronomical Union term.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer Telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are in blue and the pink dots, more difficult to identify, are the "newborns" in the birth room of the universe.
The Spitzer telescope has discovered this region where stars are born, called "W5", a very unromantic name, in the constellation of Cassiopeia, at 6,500 light-years.
NASA’s Spitzer Telescope has photographed the flaming glow of a dying star.
The doughnut-shaped circle is made up of elements that the star projects when it dies.
In the huge Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
The Spitzer Telescope photographed this galactic birthing room.
The Pleiades, also known as the Seven Sisters, can be seen with the naked eye at night.
However, the telescope puts more emphasis on colors.
In this infrared photo, the Helice Nebula, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is 700 light-years away in the constellation Aquarius.
Its resemblance to a terrestrial continent earned it the title of North America.
The combination of normal photo and infrared photo makes it possible to observe a spectacular hue.
Only the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope were able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest mysteries of astronomy is the creation of Saturn's rings.
One theory is that the rings are the remains of a moon of Saturn that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without leaving a trace.
One of the largest and sharpest images taken by the Hubble Telescope is that of the galaxy Tourbillon.
Depending on the hue, photographs of spiral galaxies can become real works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula in the constellation Sagittarius, several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifide comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), because three trails of dust divide the glowing heart from the birthplace of the stars.
Astronomers have photographed the beginnings of a cosmic carambola in the constellation of Snake: at 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two fusing galaxies rush toward each other, the collision is inevitable.
The Hubble Telescope observed the birth of these stars in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't like technical abbreviations, you can use its nickname "southern fire wheel".
The Hubble Space Telescope image shows a detail of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula is 1,400 light-years away and is composed of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary household dust.
This photo was made from optical and radiographic images taken by different telescopes.
The black hole circle is 430 million light-years from Earth.
The space telescope has photographed for NASA this group of galaxies called Arp 273.
Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The heavenly cradle always gives birth to new stars.
These clouds of stars, which are connected by the Rosette Nebula, also permanently create young stars 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this galaxy with rays of light and pierced by a small black hole, there is still no dust, there is only gas.
Scientists believe that it was born shortly after the bigbang, when the universe was largely composed of hydrogen.
Our view of the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope was reportedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have continued to grow and thanks to them, it has been possible to see ever further into the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale telescope at Mount Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror on this image had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, in the United States, is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It makes it possible to observe the universe through two mirrors each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The belly of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, in the Canary Islands, is huge. The mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented to make savings.
The diameter still reaches about eleven meters.
The disadvantage of the economical construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the vertical angle, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at the vertical angle.
Its peculiarity is due to its large light-collecting capacity.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is closer to those of the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists are listening to the universe in search of extraterrestrial signals using the Arecibo radio telescope (Puerto Rico).
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Anyone who owns a computer can help with the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI, or "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence") by contributing the computing power of their machine.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope, an installation worthy of its name.
Thanks to a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also planned for the ESO site in Chile.
Its main mirror is expected to reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will be composed of almost 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the telescope will not be able to take pictures until 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, Keck's two telescopes on Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They wore two mirrors with a diameter of 10 meters each.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea observatory that observes the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF.
A new gigantic telescope should also be built on Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 meters.
This illustration allows you to admire it.
However, the most important images of space come from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has provided us with images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable.
NASA announced on February 2, 2011, that it had found 1,235 planets candidates since the start of the mission.
This photo illustrates the latest preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space as early as 2018 aboard an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
The telescope’s mission will be to find light from the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
Scientists believe that Mercury’s South Pole is also home to ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory exists, as Messenger orbits much closer to Mercury's North Pole.
Radar data for decades indicated the presence of ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now certain.
Drink butter daily, and live up to 168 years
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country, in which we are still relatively young at 97 years old.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country, in which we are still relatively young at 97 years old.
The journey into the Talysh Mountains is of a skewed romanticism.
Around the many turns of the road, the small bus whirls along wooded hills, torrent rivers and modest farms.
Everything is green and fertile, you would almost think in the Black Forest.
But we are here in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group named Talysh lives, about which little is known, except that they speak Persian and Azeri perfectly and have a very long lifespan.
Term: Lerik.
The small town of Plastronne with its overly aggressive architecture of the Soviet era that does not agree at all with the picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is far too painful.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometers, because the road has only one track.
The province has not yet taken advantage of the legendary wealth that the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, 48-year-old Pilata Fatulayeva is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist destination.
"Baku became famous in May thanks to the Eurovision Song Contest, and next year there will be the festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulayeva explains.
She is director of the Museum of Longevity, the only museum of its kind in the world.
One can discover the life of about eight dozen Talysh of the region who are more than 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a black and white photo.
Here's my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
Having another child at the age of 136
But the controversial star of the museum is <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And when it is thought that the oldest documented person was 122 years old, the age of Müslümov seems more than doubtful.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," Fatulayeva said.
The man would have married three times and had 23 children, and at the age of 136 he would still have a daughter.
Would <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov have been wrong to calculate his age for a few decades?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard of the man in the great Central Asian age.
"Surprisingly old people also live in certain parts of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "in Sardinia too, there are men who live incredibly old."
However, it is impossible to establish scientific evidence due to the non-existence of the documents, not to mention that there was no civil registry.
Every day, a glass of melted butter
Nevertheless, it is a fact that the people of the Lerik region often reach an age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years old.
So what is the reason for longevity in the South of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azerbaijani tourist guide, explains that the Talysh have particular genes.
On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, thinks it is a matter of food.
However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that the calorie-rich meals of the Talysh, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and from which many drink a glass of melted butter daily, are good for health.
Or is it the simple way of life that preserves the youth of the people? In Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97 years old, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as is typical to see throughout the Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor next to a snail, whose content she beats relentlessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, among them one of Mirzayeva’s sons and a daughter, who have been adults for a long time.
Two small children are also playing in the house.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests served in typical belly shaped armored glasses.
Mirzayeva’s white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under her scarf are long braids of a dark blonde that her son reveals to us with pride.
I’ve always washed my hair with milk, and that’s how I never lost them and they kept their color.
“I’ve never used shampoo,” Mirzayeva adds.
The monthly pension is enough to live
She has always eaten what comes from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In my entire life, I have never bought any food in a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after the Second World War.
But everything improved when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took command.
The language of propaganda amazes an old lady's mouth.
However, the cult of the paternal figure of the nation, a man who still ruled his country as a dictator, knows almost no limits in Azerbaijan.
He remained in power until 2003, and was succeeded by his son Ilham.
In any case, the elderly of Azerbaijan do not know the distress.
Mirzayeva receives 230 manats (approximately the same amount as in euros) a month for her retirement, a sum that guarantees a good livelihood in the region.
And perhaps Mirzayeva’s long-graying son is right: “the elders enjoy great respect in our culture.”
They are the center of the great family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
This is a good reason to live as long as possible.
The "rights of man" omitted in the Constitution
The revolution is being revived in Cairo.
Rival demonstrations reveal the deep fracture of the country.
The Sharia-based draft constitution is fiercely controversial.
The Egyptian president is not greedy with words filled with emotions.
We must succeed in the transition.
"And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God," he told state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, but also especially to Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened and secular Muslims.
For all members of the confused and desperately disunited opposition are afraid.
They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile at the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost apologising, that he had temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his own "to save the revolution."
However, Egyptians and the world don’t really know what this 61-year-old engineer, who holds a PhD from the American University of Southern California, wants to save.
Will the judiciary be overthrown?
The 234 articles hurriedly drafted by the 100-strong Islamic Constituent Assembly during a fifteen-hour night tour of force are indeed troubling to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that jurisprudence is based on “the principles of Islamic law.”
But what does the word “principles” really mean?
It was and still is a matter of interpretation, and there is good reason to fear that Islamists will use the vague formulation and the resulting legal manoeuvre to apply a stricter interpretation of Sharia.
In any case, it is suggested that a newly introduced article stating that, with regard to all topics related to Sharia, al-Azhar University should be consulted. The institution is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its radiance shines on all Sunni Islamic world.
This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative apparatus, which would result in the de facto supervision of the judiciary.
Many points of the draft Constitution are subject to interpretation.
Another problematic aspect is the likely maintenance of military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's reign, these courts tried to repress opponents.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were held by the military.
The state must also, it reads in the draft, protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values".
From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that state institutions could even control the content of cinematographic art and literature.
Clearly, it would simply be censorship.
Moreover, no article expressly guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead, another article forbids offending or defaming the Prophet Muhammad or his envoys.
However, the article does not define what an offence is or how it should be punished.
Equally doubtful is the wording suggesting that it is forbidden to "offend people".
Is it enough to draw a cartoon of the president or tell a joke at the expense of a lawman?
Many points are therefore to be interpreted in the draft that Morsi submits to the vote and which, in his own words, will be the subject of a referendum with the Egyptians "very soon".
"The revolution is coming again"
The opposition has been mobilizing for weeks against the digital superiority of Islamists.
On Friday evening, tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered in an unusual concert on Tahrir Square in Cairo, vowing to bring down the sharia before it comes into force.
“The revolution is reborn and we are going to win,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, who came third in the presidential election.
The Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei said the draft constitution was “thrown into the rubbish bin of history.”
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi’s supporters of wanting to foment a “putsch against democracy.”
"If he announces the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow it," said Jasser Said, an opposition leader.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet atoned for," said Khaled Ali, a politician and member of the opposition.
In addition, several judges have announced that they do not want to monitor the referendum, which would result in its nullity.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim Brotherhood called for a counter-demonstration not on Tahrir Square as a precaution, but on the other side of the Nile, where a great prayer was organized in front of the University of Cairo.
The veiled women and followers of the Salafists, who participated in it in large numbers, chanted: "the people demand the application of the law of God."
“Clean up our country!” they asked Morsi, saying that “the Qur’an [was] their constitution.”
A struggle for sovereignty on the symbolic Tharir Square, where everything began, would soon have engendered a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, this is what Morsi’s supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that the opponents of the draft Constitution, as well as its supporters, had expressed themselves loud and clear.
According to them, it is now time to let the people decide by the ballot box the direction that the country should take.
The Islamist project will certainly win the majority.
“Human rights are not mentioned once.”
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this imposed constitutional process that should have lasted until February and encompassed all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or in the courts under Mubarak.
He did so not because he shared their conception of the world, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
That's why he was beaten, tried and imprisoned.
"And now, the term is not even pronounced once in the new constitution," he regretted during his interview with Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three powers discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are blatant violations of the rules of democracy and will lead to a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president de facto strips him of all his powers," Saeda said.
Yet a democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, including by the international community, who looks at the battle between different political ideologies on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
It could pay off.
A protester in Tharir Square warns: "You are giving birth to a monster that you will no longer be able to control."
The rakfish of Norway: is it the most fragrant fish in the world?
The five million people who inhabit Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country’s success be linked to the appetite of locals for an extremely fragrant fish?
Take some advanced cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and dirty football clothes.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of rakfisk, one of Norway’s most popular dishes.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about 3 hours from Oslo.
It snows, the landscape is spectacular - and this omnipresent smell permeates the air.
The rakfish consists of salt-sprayed trout and fermented in water for a period of time - depending on the smell you want it to exhale - which can go up to a year.
When the darkness settles and it is cold, the Norwegians gather in mass to attend a festival that takes place here, in Fagernes, dedicated to this incredible culinary specialty.
"You eat raw, then you swallow a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, a full-time local firefighter also known as "Rakfisk General", who is responsible for managing the festival.
Around us, people swallow small pieces of fish and put on a large amount of drink.
“Some people prefer aquavit to rakfish,” adds Havard.
The drink kills the smell.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can avoid getting it under your nose, it’s not bad – it’s reminiscent of a sushi that would have spent long hours on a bus.
The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, the fish was immersed in airtight water barrels, then salted in the fall.
Then, during the winter, once well fermented, the fish is out and - no doubt with the senses weakened by alcohol - eaten.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, emigrating mainly to the United States.
Now, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a comprehensive health system.
The Swedes, their old rivals whose country was not so long ago richer than Norway, cross the border to come to work.
The rakfisk is considered to be something important, a vital, albeit fragrant, element of Norway's past.
This is one of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a small pint of beer or a sandwich will cost you 10 <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> each.
Norway does not often talk about it in international news, which is not to her displeasure.
Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the right-wing racist extremist who shot 77 people, including women and children.
When they mention this killing, they speak of the “July 22 incident.”
The Norwegians have a hard time accepting that in their peaceful country, one of them could have committed such an act of barbarism.
Since the early 1970s, Norway owes its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the largest in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason for our success," explains Anna, our waitress, with blond hair and eyes of a translucent blue, the image of Nordic well-being, with a rakfish tray in hand.
We are - as you say - prudent people.
His English, like that of most people who live here, is perfect.
We are discreet, we do not like to be noticed.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution - everything, except a small percentage of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When other countries were throwing money through the windows, in the years that led us to the international financial crisis, Norway was able to keep the cords of its stock market tight.
“As long as you can ski in the winter and hike in the summer, we are happy,” says Anna.
"Without forgetting the rakfisk," she adds in a carefree laugh.
I stand under the snow and queue to buy myself something to eat - I got my dose of rakfisk.
On the menu, a hamburger made of pulse, a real discovery, it's excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel I stay at is one of the many places where rakfisk is served for dinner and where you can vote for the best of them - or maybe for the smelliest of them.
There's a TV show where the presenter wears a butterfly knot, surrounded by rakfisk plates.
It looks like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score did you give the best fish in the Thor-Juergen Mountains?"
"Here are the points, Havard."
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps because of aquavit abuse.
Or maybe it's because of the fish emanations.
Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto has a tough start.
As incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office in Mexico, Will Grant, of the BBC, is interested in the difficulties that await him and the expectations of the people, which are numerous.
Road traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at the moment.
In a city where traffic jams are legion in normal time, a security dam has been set up since Monday, blocking several key road accesses in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
However, the goal was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential scarf to become the new president at the head of the nation.
A complicated task awaits him.
Mexico’s economy is doing well, the results that one owes to outgoing President Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already cost the lives of some 60,000 people in six years.
“My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,” Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before joining the U.S. President, Mr. Pena Nieto was Governor of the State of Mexico.
A very populous and sprawling state that encloses the capital. On its land of preference, opinions about this new leader are divided.
A direct man
In the bucolic municipality of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is inscribed in the memory of all.
The locals attribute to it the development of tourism and infrastructure in the municipality.
To reach the city, you can take one of the new highways of M Pena Nieto, a significant improvement has been made to these roads, once bumpy and full of crevices.
Plaques bearing his name are hung outside a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
“We count on him to bring about lasting change,” said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of Congress and the party of Mr Pena Nieto, the PRI.
In terms of security and economy in particular, we hope for a real change that our country needs so much.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace in Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party regarding Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects criticism from opponents who accuse the new president of lacking charisma.
He's a whole man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
He is an excellent statesman and, above all, he knows how to listen.
However, this is not always the image that people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more striking.
Hidden under the motorway bridges, it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was called to the rescue to fight drug gangs in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is particularly serious.
In a disastrous area, the bodies of dozens of women murdered over the past two years have been found on the edge of a landfill.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place infamous for the number of innocent women who were killed there.
The critics of Mr. Pena Nieto, say that at best, he failed to contain the problem of murders committed against women when he was in office.
At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to face reality.
In a concrete house, typical of this ravaged neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to hold back her tears when she shows me pictures of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version reports a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family thinks she was killed by her partner.
"When I arrived at her house, it seemed to me that her body had been washed," says Se<0xC3><0xB1>ora Buendia.
Signs indicated that she had been beaten, and the cadaveric stiffness had already begun.
As her mother tells the story, a photo of Mariana dresses the wall, next to a cross with the word: Justice.
However, this is exactly what the family was refused.
The authorities treated me as if I were an old commere, a proponent of disorder, a crying woman.
They want us to accept what they say and shut up.
“But it’s not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions,” she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives his scarf on Saturday, it will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has vowed to make it his priority during his term.
"I hope he will be as good as he was when he was governor," Olvera said in Valle del Bravo, a member of Congress.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning did not complain of ill-treatment, prosecutors said.
Prosecutors are trying to counter the claims of abuse that Bradley Manning allegedly suffered during his detention.
Manning is being held in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants to classify the case on the grounds that Manning's kidnapping took place under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to demonstrate on Friday that Private Bradley Manning -- accused of causing the largest leak of confidential information in U.S. military history -- has missed many opportunities to complain about the mistreatment he claims to have endured during his military detention.
During a cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Attorney General Ashden Fein stated that records of weekly visits made to Manning by officers during his nine-month detention in Quantico, Virginia, revealed no complaints regarding his treatment.
The cross-examination -- during a hearing, the defense filed a petition demanding that the Manning case be classified on the grounds that the kidnapping took place under very difficult conditions and constituted a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place one day after Manning testified his willingness to commit suicide during his murder.
The military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was their source.
At Friday's hearing, Fein discussed with Manning the forms the officers had filled out after their meeting with Manning, during his detention in the Quantico military prison, where he was subjected to maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein referred to the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment his guards had given him was “excellent” and that the treatment he had had inside the prison was overall “very professional.”
The forms do not report any complaints of ill-treatment, although officers directly questioned him about his prison treatment, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had orally expressed concerns about certain issues and that visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but they did not report the issues raised.
“They wrote ‘no problem’ (after addressing the concerns), and yet that didn’t mean I didn’t raise any problems,” Manning said.
Military Judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment during an interview in January 2011 with the Special Committee that had met to discuss the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning responded that his intention during the meeting was to have his restrictive status changed indicating a "risk of injury".
The military said they had assigned him this restrictive status -- a level below close surveillance for suicide risk -- for his protection and the safety of others.
“I wanted the staff to know that I was okay, and I wanted this status to be withdrawn... in order to benefit from a better quality of life from my point of view,” Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the Marine Corps military prison base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he considered suicide when he was in Kuwait and fainted once because of the heat.
He added that not being kept informed of what was going to happen to him or what was happening in the rest of the world was very distressing.
“My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, to this cage,” Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in this cage.
Once in Quantico, Manning said he had spent the clearest of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only items he had at his disposal were a mattress, blanket, tongs, clothing and his glasses.
He tried to stay in motion, because sleeping or lying down during the day was against the rules.
Manning also clarified that when he was trying to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards could not see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up so that they could see his face.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint for Manning's treatment in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Also on Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation reported in his testimony on Thursday -- that after being forced to sleep naked all night in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other detainees one morning, during the appeal.
Manning testified that at no time was he allowed to cover himself with a cover during the call.
During the judge’s questions on Friday, Manning said he had deduced from his guard’s order that he should release his cover that could have concealed his nudity, but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to release her.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before, as he allegedly tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning reportedly told the officer that he could have used the elastic in his slipper or tongs to injure himself, but that he had not.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, his pants, and his glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account his experiences during his detention and that he will significantly reduce his sentence if he is found guilty in a court martial, a trial that is expected to take place early next year.
The defense said Manning plans to plead guilty to the least serious crimes and fight for the abandonment of other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing is expected to resume this weekend, with prosecutors arguing that conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has confirmed that Manning has been incarcerated in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of all detainees in Quantico.
Charges against Manning include theft of property or public documents, collusion with the enemy, resulting in the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information related to national defense.
If all the indictees are detained, he shall be sentenced to life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He says many have been forced to leave Mexico because of lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind Mexicans of difficult times, he said.
Navarrete says that Mexicans find themselves caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico, arriving in the lobby, in front of customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
Signs indicated two paths: one for the "Mexicans" ("Mexicans"), another for the "Foreigners" ("Foreigners").
I stood still for a few seconds, not knowing which line to take.
I grew up in central California, where I've been called the "Mexican" my whole life.
It is an ethnic qualification, just as my friends in Boston use it when they call themselves "Irish", or my friends in New York when they call themselves "Italian".
Then I became "Mexico-American".
But here, it was Mexico.
And in the land where my grandfather was born, there is no need for a special qualification or a line of union.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to handle an interview in either language.
But I don't have the vocabulary of an Aboriginal, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my American passport and headed to the “Foreigners” queue.
I thought about that moment in the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama at the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their favorite themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans stay in Mexico rather than risk themselves in the United States.
He wants to join forces with the United States and Canada, and create a Union for Trade on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto is committed to continuing the war against drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not provide more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of bitterness.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to cede in writing half of their territory to the tip of the gun.
But for Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and not minutes, memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as soon as a U.S. official makes the slightest criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about how Americans are violating their neighbor's sovereignty.
And the children of Montezuma are looking for the fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is the one that the country has with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Do you want us to address the issue of bitterness?
There are a lot of them.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not.
The only reason why there are so many Mexican ancestors in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at some point, in our family tree, a person, maybe a parent or grandparent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the North.
And most often, this person corresponded to a typical profile -- dark, uneducated skin, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not in Mexico.
And even though we are currently living the American dream, we have gone to good schools and we have good situations, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we are living, and not the Mexican dream.
Our identity is sometimes disturbed, but our loyalty is obvious.
We give it to the United States.
Moreover, we know that a part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not like us.
The feeling is reciprocal.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they toast us as if we were individuals of inferior strain and not sufficiently Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn’t failed while living in Mexico, they would never have left.
And we would not find ourselves stuck on the right side of the barrier, living comfortably in the United States, but like lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who emigrated legally to the United States when she was a child, reminds me that there are frictions between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans, because Mexicans are more firmly claiming their identity and Mexican-Americans are upset about it.
Although she is an American citizen, she has the feeling of being part of two countries.
Moreover, many Mexican-Americans I know do not feel like they are part of one country or the other.
We love the music of the Mexican band, Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we are considered to be Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And now, to complicate the relationship a little more, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and part of the intelligentsia want to get closer to the Diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as ambassadors of fortune for Mexico, representing its interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a superb country that must be visited and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much bitterness.
And, given the ubiquitous wage inequalities, corruption and drug-related violence, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You're gonna have to deal with this on your own, amigos.
It's normal.
While some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States in the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexican Americans still want them in the way their family members were treated not so long ago.
- Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexicans" than I thought.
Old quarrels, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Will there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed seems to indicate that such hope is in vain.
While the same futile arguments about who started persist, dozens of buildings have been reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza have landed near Tel Aviv, the capital of Israel.
But while the Israelis and Palestinians seem to be stuck in their old conflict, all around them, the Middle East is in full swing.
The Arab Spring has blown everything up, and whether we like it or not, the Palestinians and the Israelis are caught up in this regional upheaval.
Perhaps their struggle will intensify even more.
Yet there is every reason to think that this could help them get out of this deadly impasse.
A war that makes no losers or winners
At first glance, it seems difficult to be optimistic.
Although the ceasefire granted on November 21 continues, this week’s fighting has strengthened supporters of the force on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will boast of forcing the Israelis to give up, even if Gaza has wiped out a razor blade.
Having killed some of its leaders and driven the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza into one of the most miserable and overcrowded corners of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas gains ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their Fatah rivals, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders might say that time is their ally.
The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is growing stronger, and Hamas has become rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a booming regional power, once Israel’s closest Muslim ally, has taken the lead for Hamas; as has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
Hamas members cheer and say that the growing Islamist bends around Israel, from Lebanon in the north, where Hezbollah militia exercises domination, through Syria, where Islamist-oriented rebels can overthrow Bashar El Assad, and up to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten him.
And most importantly, on the southern flank of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and central of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
The Muslim Brotherhood, on the other hand, are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders are more easily reliant on public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important actor that can no longer be excluded even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, Israel’s hardline supporters will draw the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas has been put back in a box.
The Iron Dome missile interception system has proven to be effective and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will be able to sleep on their two ears – for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its unwavering support; and many European countries have blamed Hamas for being at the root of the latest wave of violence.
But most importantly, Israel prospered, particularly under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who completely ignored the peace process.
Although rocket fire from Gaza has killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared from suicide bombings, notably thanks to the separation barrier that breaches the West Bank, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state, and which protects Jewish settlements from continuing to harm themselves.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party has merged with an even more bellicose party, that of leader Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the January 22 election, has the good part.
Why spoil these Palestinians by giving them a state?
If they were leading the West Bank, would they not launch rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is best to keep them behind this wall and hit them as soon as they come out of their head.
Perhaps the supporters of the hard line will win; but it may be that the Arab Spring changes the game.
Even if the Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere have little appreciation for Israel, their priority will be to address the problems in their own countries.
Israel’s defense budget is more important than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to settle their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get a ceasefire which is a good thing -- and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder keg that is destined to explode one day in the Israeli-occupied territories – a bit like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already weakening democracy in the Jewish state, and demographics are exacerbating this problem as the Arab population grows.
Bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to ring the bell of Hamas will have a diplomatic prize.
Both sides need to be pushed by those from the outside.
The answer remains the one advocated by the reasonable people on each side, and by most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with an assignment of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
One hope, small and short-term, is that the ceasefire will give outsiders the opportunity to defend this cause.
Egypt, which must now strive to end the flow of arms to Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in line with the 1967 borders with exchanges of land and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs from outside countries should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute far more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the forthcoming proposal of a pseudo-state to the UN.
Mr. Obama also has every interest in Israel agreeing to negotiate.
During his first term, he did not present his own peace plan.
Back at the White House, he seems equally reluctant to establish one.
It's a very narrow vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Laws for neutral packets of cigarettes came into force in Australia
Warnings and photos of diseased organs cover the dark green packets that are all identical, regardless of brand
This law that came into force in Australia is a world premiere, logos and colors have been replaced by a dark olive green and horrific pictures of diseased organs and depictions of children and babies whose diseases were caused by their parents' smoking.
Apart from the various photos and health warnings, the only difference between the packages, since Saturday, is the brand name, printed in small letters on all packages.
This is the world’s strictest tobacco packaging regime.
The Australian federal government said the goal was to deter young people from smoking by removing any glamorous representation.
Studies have shown that if people do not start smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that they never start.
"Even when they are very young, children understand the message conveyed by tobacco manufacturers through their brand image," said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that revealed, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with a princess.
Although Australia has the lowest smoking rate in the world and these changes have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has been pushing against this law.
Tobacco manufacturers said it would relaunch black market trade, which would make it easier to access cheaper cigarettes.
“Noxious consequences will result from this legislation,” said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will sell far more counterfeit cigarettes on the streets of Australia.
Others said that this law had boosted their activity.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said the demand for cigarette cases, including silicone to hide the horrific packaging, has risen sharply two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco contested the law and lost in Australia's high court.
Ha said Zico has sold 6,000 of them to wholesalers and is awaiting stock renewal.
For us, business is good.
The only nuisance, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the segment of the population targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws banning TV advertising, sports sponsorship and the obligation for retailers to hide cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned web advertising by local businesses and sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites from doing so.
"If you work in tobacco marketing and you only have a small showcase to promote your products, the Internet is the place to go," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in contributions from some lambda citizens in favor of brands on social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We have to ask ourselves if this is a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and who has made the effort to make a video, or if this is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia said the industry is focusing on the new regulation in force rather than marketing.
The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to contest these new court decisions - these countries have told the WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries have had significant trade with Australia.
A decision by the WTO is expected to be taken in the course of 2013.
Plibersek said the government had held discussions with other countries regarding similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make packaging warning photos mandatory in 2001.
Now, these warnings are present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are currently under study in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The pictures don't bother me.
I ignore them.
"You take a cigarette and you store the package," Victor El Hage said when buying a package with a picture of a tumour in his mouth.
To be honest, the only reason I'm gonna get arrested is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the "King of the Tobacconist Pack" in central Sydney, said the uniformity of packaging made it difficult to store packages on the shelves.
“Before, it took me an hour to unload a package, now it takes me four hours,” Yu said.
"The government only had to ban them once and for all and we would have said OK, that's okay, we stop and put the key under the door," he added, raising his arms to the sky.
In a constantly connected world, it can be good to get bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during the Thanksgiving period because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for the arrival of another plane.
Therefore, I have had enough time to reflect on the theme of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight is pretty boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (not to mention duty-free shops).
But more and more, some academics and experts specialized in the development of the child are praising boredom.
It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - to get bored from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain to take interesting paths, and even to nurture creativity.
And as we are, for the most part, constantly facing several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome the annoyance with open arms?
Oh, yeah.
And no.
But I'll be back.
First of all, like many people, I thought boredom was a rather recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But this is not the case, says Peter Toohey, professor of Greco-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
"The boredom goes back a long way," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii there are Latin graffiti that evoke boredom, they go back to the first century.
Then there is the definition that we give to boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined, and debated, in different ways, said John D. Eastwood, associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After going through many publications and submitting the idea to a discussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience of “wanting to do something, but not getting started in a satisfying activity.”
What differentiates boredom from apathy, he says, is that the person is not undertaking a task even though he would like it.
With apathy, he says, there is no desire to do anything.
What is at the heart of the boredom, he said, is "the interruption of the attention process, associated with a mean mood and the feeling that time passes slowly."
Boredom can strongly resemble depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that if the two can be related, people who get bored tend to think the problem comes from the environment or the world, while depressed people think the problem comes from them.
Sometimes we think we get bored when it is actually a problem of concentration.
As part of their study, "The Uningaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention," which was published in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and colleagues highlighted an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a person's voice on tape, a magazine article.
Some groups heard, from the room next door, too loud a sound of a TV show that had no connection, others just heard the TV show, and the third group did not hear the soundtrack at all.
Those who heard TV at a low sound level said they were more bored than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, but didn't know why, and attributed this concentration problem to boredom.
When you’re trying to focus on a difficult or demanding task, a distraction can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study’s authors.
On the other hand, when you perform a boring task, "like looking at objects on a string, music can help you not get bored."
In fact, he says, now we know that when we twist or scratch, these gestures, often seen as signs of boredom, are actually a good way to stay physically more alert.
“Studies have shown that children who are allowed to giggle learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to remain motionless,” said Professor Fenske.
We all get bored one day or another - the delay of my flight, a speaker with a monochord voice, a particularly boring film.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To measure this, researchers developed a “boredom predisposition scale” in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements such as, “Among the tasks I perform, many of them are repetitive and monotonous,” and “I have so many interests that I don’t have time to do everything.”
Using such a scale, researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a psychology professor at the University of West Florida, and in particular need numerous and varied stimulations.
But in general, teenagers are quickly blasphemed.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of individual and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment during which he contacted nearly 400 teens and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
He noted that 32 percent of teens reported getting bored at school and during their homework, while 23 percent reported getting bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether today’s boredom rates, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that “teenager is a period when boredom reaches its highest level,” particularly because children and adolescents don’t have much control over what they want to do.
If I ask my question: is boredom good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, make bets or abuse certain substances to pass the time, as studies show.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers evoke a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
“Annoyance is the way the brain has found to let you know that you should do something else,” said Gary Marcus, a psychology professor at N.Y.U.
But the brain doesn’t always know what is the most appropriate thing to do.
If you get bored and use that energy to play the guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he will not get bored anymore, but he will not have learned to take care of himself or to self-regulate, says Professor Fenske.
And "this self-regulation goes from one situation to another," he says.
Your child not only learns to have fun, he gets more control of himself in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify boredom.
Just as I don't think we should criticize it either.
Feeling comfortable outside of the constant bubbling that activities and technology generate is the goal we should be striving for.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this point.
“We need to get bored more often, but boredom awakens an acute and frenetic desire to be connected to something that makes sense,” he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy downtime.
"In an environment where we're constantly overstimulated," he added, "it's hard to find ways to jump into something when the noise stops."
In Colorado, no directive for the new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, 19, a college student and football player in Colorado, is charged with something that will soon become legal in his state: possession of marijuana balls and a pipe used to smoke them.
Orozco said that one day, in September, he and a few friends were in a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found the marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a subpoena to appear for possession of drugs and material that could be used for his consumption - minor offenses, each accompanied by a fine of $100 - and a date of appearance.
“We are treated like criminals,” Orozco said.
But is there one?
During the weeks of uncertainty that followed the Colorado vote to legalize the consumption of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving low drug use depends more on the place than the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which adopted a similar measure, hundreds of offences involving the use of marijuana were classified without consequence.
Police have stopped indicting adults aged 21 and over for minor marijuana possession, as the law will come into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado’s more conservative constituencies have called for speeding up existing marijuana cases and continue to indict people who own them.
At the same time, several cities from suburban Denver to the Western Mountains are currently voting to prevent state-approved marijuana shops from opening in their neighborhoods.
“Things are moving so fast that I don’t know what the future holds for us,” said Daniel J. Oates, Aurora police chief, east of Denver.
Washington State regulators are also asking a lot of questions.
They are looking for guidance on how to install a permit system, allowing them to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - by the deadline of December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether you like it or not, is ahead of most states when it comes to marijuana regulation, first for therapeutic use and now for personal use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, and it’s a good indicator,” said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, admits Mr. Smith, can do more than suggest what works.
“There is no real precedent on which we could rely,” he said.
Washington’s law, called I-502, takes effect on December 6, leaving a one-year legal vacuum, during which the permit system will still not exist, while marijuana possession will be legal.
Meanwhile, practical questions remain: how to balance the state’s mandate that ensures appropriate access to licensed marijuana and prohibits the installation of cannabis sales outlets within a 30 km radius around a school, park, playground or cr<0xC3><0xA8>che.
“There will be no more difficult places than urban areas to set up an approved cannabis sales trade, particularly in the Seattle metropolitan area,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the recently formed Cannabis Legalization Center.
On November 21, the chief of police, Oates, in Aurora, sent an email to his officers announcing that the "City Attorney" (public prosecutor's representative) would no longer prosecute people aged 21 and over who possess small amounts of marijuana, and that the police should stop indicting people for this type of crime.
Chief Oates said the police would enforce the new court decisions that regulate the activity of those who grow marijuana for medical purposes, and would continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, the "district attorney" (Prosecutor of the Republic), Ken Buck, embodies a stricter vision.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to deal with marijuana possession affairs, mainly to pressure users into getting detoxified.
Currently, 119 people are charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are subject to other charges.
“Our office has an obligation to prosecute those people who committed an offence that, at the time of the incident, was a recognized offence,” Buck said.
Reactions have been complicated even in rural areas such as Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative in favor of restricted marijuana use.
Police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, no longer show adults for possession of limited quantities.
The county's public prosecutor's representative, Pete Hautzinger, supported the decision, but also decided not to immediately classify all marijuana detention cases.
“I don’t feel like I’m wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes,” he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, providing a legal and government framework appropriate for personal marijuana consumption is not easy.
And the contradictory reactions that have been observed in different U.S. cities highlight the deep ambivalence among local officials regarding the legalization of marijuana.
"This is a cultural barrier" with prosecutors, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents people accused of using marijuana and who speaks as a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
“They’ve spent a good part of their lives prosecuting people who used marijuana, also, do they have a hard time accepting that it’s legal,” he said.
As the first states to treat restricted marijuana use at the same level as alcohol, Colorado and the state of Washington are on the verge of becoming a case for legalizing drugs.
As defenders and state officials envision a new frontier of legalized sales, they are anxiously awaiting federal government directives, which still views the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Proponents of marijuana legalization hope that the Justice Ministry will give in.
Despite some publicized arrests of medical marijuana patients and vendors, the federal government has mostly allowed medical marijuana sales outlets to practice in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
While it’s true that police are likely not going to knock on doors to seize small bags of drugs, there’s a strong bet that they’re opposed to authorized retailers selling marijuana for personal use authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political adviser to the Obama administration.
Many cities in Colorado have not waited for the federal authorities to act.
Long before the vote, some local governments approved moratoriums on the creation of new marijuana sales businesses, even if it is only a one-year postponement.
Last week, the city of Montrose obtained a six-month moratorium, and is expected to impose that ban next week.
“We don’t want to find ourselves in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then find ourselves faced with a federal problem,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the community vote rather than the state vote.
A lot of questions arise.
Petronella Wyatt: I was mistreated and excluded from Oxford because I was a Tory.
Today’s students are not the only ones who are being attacked for their opinions.
As far as I can remember, I've always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied in what was to me a prominent place of knowledge, a kind of modern Greek amphitheatre that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.
Yet, two weeks after I moved to Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to pack my bags, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started to cry.
My friends were disconcerted.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I had left this university because I objected to the fact that first-year students had sex in the room next to mine.
Author A. N. Wilson boldly stated that I had left after being forced to drink in broken cups.
The truth was less funny.
I'm gone.
Yes, I fled, because I had been the victim of intimidation and the object of constant harassment.
Not because of my rather exaggerated name, nor because I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for only one reason, and in this cradle of so-called knowledge, I was the victim of racist and barbaric behavior: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why talk about it today, you’ll tell me.
Well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of center-right students is undergoing the same kind of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hatred of Tory students in Oxford is such that last week, some of them demanded protection of their rights, as well as those of gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College’s Student Hall (JCR) said they were “often isolated, personally attacked and felt unwanted” because of their political views.
They want there to be a representative on the University's Equal Opportunities Committee so that their opinions can be freely expressed.
Their situation was not facilitated by the recent BBC Two documentary "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which depicted the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
Among them was student Joe Cooke, former president of the "Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA) ", who moves in Rolls-Royce, wears a silver complete and moves with a chrome-headed cane.
In other universities, conservative students say they are being treated as scapegoats for setting up higher tuition fees."
Luke Black, 20, vice president of the "Nottingham University Conservative Association", told a Sunday newspaper "that there is a growing left-wing bias in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us."
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi, who proposed a motion for more protection, says such a climate is "uncomfortable," and Stephanie Cherill, 19, president of the OUCA, says there has been a deterioration in the attitude of JCR members toward people who are center-right.
"This constitutes an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debates, as well as to the well-being of members," she said.
I was the only one who thought that way during my first few weeks in Oxford.
I entered in September 1986, when I was 18 years old and timidly paralyzed.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was very virulent.
The previous year, the university had voted to refuse to grant Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary degree, due to reduced funding for graduate studies.
The atmosphere was filled with Stalinist vibrations.
From the first days of the host week, when the new students got to know each other and the teachers, I had a taste of what was going to happen next.
I found that the teachers not only participated in the sarcasms towards the Tory students, but also enjoyed them.
It was as if the policy of strike miners, the privatization and opposition of the government to the sanctions against apartheid in South Africa were engraved in the woods of the classrooms.
The first sarcasm of which I was the victim was a translation into English of 18th century French texts, and I was not prepared for it.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph"
I lost my foot.
Pitt, a little man with a pustulous face, took it easy.
“Do the Thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?” he asked.
The other students laughed.
Tears were burning in my eyes.
"I suggest you take French classes during your free time - finally, if you're not too busy making friends," he said.
I went back to my room, inconsolable.
At dinner that night, I sat alone and felt a slight tap on my shoulder.
It was a second-year student of English, named James, who presented himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said, kindly.
I'm afraid that's the way it is.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory (conservative) is targeted.
It's already hard enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even harder for you.
Most young Tory people claim to be Labour.
Later, at the local pub, I cowardlyly tried to hide.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything that Mrs Thatcher had said.
This ploy has failed.
A first-year student of philosophy, political science and economics who, ironically, had studied at Eton, said, "You're the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're contaminated.
Other students took up the chorus.
I was perverted, man.
"How do the Tories make love?" asked one of them.
They're hitting each other, aren't they?"
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the sixties.
Could I have just lived a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet people who share the same views only after nightfall?
Should I have become Labour and renounce my opinions?
The next three years would look like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, who taught at my university.
He was hated not only because he was conservative, but also because he was Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of the authors of his speeches.
He was almost never there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as its adherence to the Marxist-Determinist point of view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
“You won’t be happy here,” he said.
I began to shuttle between Oxford and my parents’ home in London, finding refuge with my family and more open-minded city friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and I explained why.
He was unbelieving.
During his studies at Oxford, in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said patheticly.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city of dreaming bell towers.
Even my communist friends had impeccable manners.
He had tears in his eyes.
Give them a chance.
I'm sure it's to make fun of you.
It would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Tired of my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to pressure and renounced his convictions.
During a working session the following week, when another history professor suggested the world’s most serious, that I was “an enemy of the people,” I decided to do the same.
Internally blushing with shame, I admitted to being a victim of my parents’ brainwashing and treating them as “old fools.”
The rest was short-lived.
It's my father who shoved the last nail in my Oxfordian coffin.
At that time, he wrote two columns in the Murdoch press every week.
My door was locked.
I was stuck in my room, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never went back there.
You can treat me like a wet crying chicken.
But no 18-year-old should be the victim of such bullying in a school.
The most tragic is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but also enjoys an unshakable reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: a Master of Couture", inaugurated this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian fashion designer.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The couturier recognized him at the inauguration of "Valentino: a Master of Couture", a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 haute couture models created for his fashion house over the past 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he said with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the focal point of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and apart from the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, we find an impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exposes his personal memories as the trophies of his social ascent: from the modest couturier of the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to the idol of the international jet-set.
There's nothing wrong with loving royalty.
“At least they don’t crush their cigarette butts on your beautiful carpet like some pop stars do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We all love to be invited to his Gstaad cottage," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, an intimate friend of past beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugénie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
Even so, he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino model
The Argentine model, Valeria Mazza, has also not forgotten the charism of the couturier.
Several years ago, after a parade on the Spanish Steps in Rome, we went to his apartment for dinner.
There were about 20 of us, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We could see and feel his mind in every detail of his apartment, in the decoration, the food, the music.
"With him, every guest felt important and appreciated," recalls the "top model", who began working with him during the week of Haute-Couture in Paris in 1995.
“It will never go out of fashion, because its creations are works of art,” she concludes.
Parade of the line of nobility
Garavani’s life is not a story of obsessions but of shared loves.
He likes people well raised and with the greatest titles and they love him too.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamourous podium of sixty meters wide that offers to exchange the roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and has to walk on the podium to admire a "public" of dream carrying the main creations of Valentino, as the tailor that had chosen Jackie Kennedy in his wedding to the porta<0xC3><0xAF>te "Viatti<0xC3><0xA2>" or "Viatti<0xC3><0xA2>"
Among this model audience are names such as Sybille of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sophie of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the couturier in 2006
Many of her clients say that Valentino’s first clothes are like the first love, “impossible to forget.”
I remember it perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a vest "gillette" and a jacket from the autumn-winter 1971-1972 collection.
“It was a gift he had given me,” said Naty Abascal, one of the couturier’s muses.
"I prefer him to everyone else for his femininity, his great love for women, and because he sublimates our beauty," the former Duchess of Feria added.
I really like the colors he uses, they are bright and brighten the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashionable Patricia della Giovampaola of Arenberg can not forget the first time she wore a Valentino model.
When she was a teenager living in Italy, she dreamed of having the age and the opportunity to wear one of her evening dresses...
This was finally possible in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino model for a party at my cousin's castle, Prince Edward of Lines.
It was a red evening dress, with a ruffled skirt, a draped bustier and a décolleté to fall off.
"It was a dream come true," said Rodrigues d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with the timeless," explains the Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess of Arenberg keeps the evening dresses of the couturier with "the utmost care, because an evening dress is not only a dress, it is also the set of memories that it carries".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress worn during her marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (the tailor calls his seamstresses) to make this dress in ivory silk with inlays of pearls, twelve kinds of different lace and a drag of four and a half meters.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of haute couture of the late 20th century, "the return of high society customers".
Obscured for years by the "know-being" of the nobility, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the greatest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any husband of his clients.
“His sophistication, his calmness, his neat and perfect appearance have always jumped in my eyes,” admits d’Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friends.
"He was impeccable, the years have no effect on him."
If it's a princess who says it...
The World's Toughest Job: Kawah Ijen's Human Mules
For four euros, the Indonesian volcano’s carriers risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulfur through steep stone paths.
There are people for whom work is hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who make their living carrying the sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
He has to work every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulfur gas from the earth's intestines solidifies in contact with the air.
After collecting large rocks of sulfur, which weigh a total of almost 70 kilograms, he installs them in two baskets of bamboo that he loads on his shoulders through the steep paths.
There are only 250 meters to the summit of the volcano that culminates at 2,386 meters of altitude, but exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb that distance, in a tortoise-like fashion, keeping their balance and measuring their steps so as not to stumble and fall into the cliff.
They know that a false step could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who made a deadly fall in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents for every kilo of sulphur extracted.
Once up, they make their way between the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus animals, and bearing the heavy baskets, they walk the 3 kilometers to the scale that a mining company has installed a little below at 1,850 meters of altitude.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating the volcano since 1960 and, it can be said, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents) per kilogram of sulfur.
It then sells it at 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry since this ore is very present in daily life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even used to whiten sugar.
“As we carry about 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) per trip,” explains Anto, who generally makes three trips a day.
Each takes 3 hours and ends up exhausted, but this allows him to earn 138,000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although this seems to be a misery for such a superhuman effort, it is three times what it would earn in the fields.
"Miners' income is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) per day and where the average monthly wage is two million rupees (167 euros)," says the porter who once worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.20 euros) per day and the job was not as difficult, but Anto returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as indisputable as sulfur: "I married a young girl from Bali, where they are converted to Hinduism, and I've married a young girl from Bali, where they've converted to Hinduism.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At 27, he spent three of his life defying the danger on the Kawah Ljen, but sulfur has already begun to make him pay the bill even though he covers his face with a mask and wears special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases released by the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay to pursue his dream.
“I’m going to work another two years, because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French,” he promises in more than acceptable English.
Driven by life, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, waiter or receptionist in a hotel, but, instead, he does the work of a mule.
It shares an unhealthy mass of wood with other carriers, gets up every day at two o'clock in the morning because the sulfur does not stop bursting at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the middle of darkness.
Defying the darkness, Anto descends into the crater illuminating himself with a small lamp attached to his helmet, which he bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 bearers load the baskets of sulfur on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulfur extraction to save costs and does not provide any equipment to carriers who work on their own and are paid by weight.
In addition, they do not touch one of the 30,000 rupees (2.50 euros) of camera surcharge, in addition to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros), which the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
“This work is done for the animals, not for humans,” protests Madrusin, a 42-year-old corpulent carrier who has been working in Kawah Ijen for thirty years since he left college.
Able to carry up to 110 kilos, he assures that he will not stop working "as long as he can", because he needs money to raise his 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18 years.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although sulfur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps the miners in the thick columns of smoke that come out of the volcano, they are so hardened that no one complains of suffering from serious diseases... to which are obviously added their usual breathing problems, arthrosis and pains.
By balancing the basket on his back, the 53-year-old Unainik can only weigh 50 kilos.
Every day, his companions and he extract 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks carry to the warehouse of Tamansari, 18 kilometers away by a path of goats overrun by weeds.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life," Unainik says, opening his mouth, revealing several missing teeth.
The eldest of his five children, aged 30, also works as a sulfur carrier.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the most difficult trades in the world: the one made by the human mules of the volcano Kawah lenjen.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans are putting the blame for this lack of children on careers, stress and the cost of accessing property.
"Singapore's population needs to grow."
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, let us fulfill our civic duty and give life!
It may seem unlikely that these words come from an advertisement for mint pills, but despite this, or perhaps thanks to this, the video spread like a trail of powder on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The lyrics come from a rap group that uses local references like “Let’s put a polychinelle in the drawer” to mock Singapore’s birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency behind the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a fun way thanks to this advertisement.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to make people fulfill “their national duty.”
It is intended only for the Internet, so we were able to make it entertaining and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the field of birth, so we felt it was a topic that we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried several things like throwing perfumes to pheromones or organizing speed-dating parties.
Many of these ideas were creative, but they didn’t necessarily work.
So we thought to ourselves: what could be more creative to solve this problem than to make it a rap song?
1.2 children
The Government of Singapore does not take it so lightly.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage its citizens to have more children.
A government measure in favor of marriages and fathers grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave, and distributes tax benefits.
But all this had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for its conservatism of its leaders and strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, according to its national population distribution, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2, considered the renewal rate, was in 1976.
So why don’t Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policies at the National Population Division, said it was due to “better education” and “a wider choice of career opportunities.”
“This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marriage and family formation,” she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in the number of single people and to the delay in marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at radically increasing immigration to counter the declining population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that abound in barely disguised xenophobia against new immigrants, especially against Chinese who are accused of pulling down wages and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the party in place in Singapore experienced its worst election results since independence last year.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with the introduction of higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the drop in the birth rate has known effects on a country's economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, it began to affect the real estate sector.
Urban development authorities have begun to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoeboxes", that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale is very successful.
However, authorities are concerned that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage promoters wishing to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of real estate company EL Developers, says its “shoe boxes” sell much faster than larger housing.
They are more popular, in the sense that these housings are built much faster than those of larger size.
For this reason, it is much more profitable for our treasury.
However, it admits that the new standards give clearer instructions to promoters, who were previously put sticks in the wheels if they wanted to offer too small housing in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
If these new regulations could be a step towards raising the national birth rate, by talking to Singaporeans working in the financial district of the center, it would seem that they are not going to have much effect.
“People are very stressed, homes are expensive, just like education, that’s why people postpone it,” says a young executive.
Other people may have children.
“But for me, it’s important to be able to have my money and my time,” another 20-year-old tells us.
Men and women mention their careers, stress and the cost of access to property and education as the reasons preventing them from having children.
Thus, although the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, it is the Singaporeans themselves who have the last word.
What is private offline is private online
Confidentiality
According to the Dictionary of the Spanish Royal Academy, this is the quality of the private domain or "the domain of privacy that we can protect from intrusion".
What is the private domain for those under the age of 16?
How to apply this definition in everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed to by broadcasting events on the Internet that he would certainly not share offline?
The newspaper elPeri<0xC3><0xB3>dico interviewed five young boys, aged between 10 and 15, frequent users of the web.
In four of the cases, they associated the term "something very personal" on the personal level and "password and username" when applying it to social networks.
“I won’t reveal my most personal secrets in a post,” says Jorge, 10, as he tries to explain the meaning of the private term on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has an account for two years.
“These are very secret secrets, my mother can know them but not everyone,” he says.
On FB, I post nice pictures or games.
I also talk to my friends.
“I’m not going to share any of my photos or anyone who would be an idiot,” he said.
The young boy acknowledges that it is wrong to post obscene photos, nude people, crimes or write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge says he knows his 35 friends on FB as well as his nine Twitter followers.
The majority are family.
Her mother is one of them, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just post them," he adds.
“Social media is fun, I can talk to distant relatives or friends, fast,” he says.
He claims that he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
He will also not trust someone who would recommend a stranger to him.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on which he admits not to know 20 of the people on his friend list.
“It doesn’t worry me because we have something in common, like music,” he says.
According to the young boy, no one made advances or asked him for his address or phone number.
“If they put pressure on me or demanded it, I would simply remove them from my account,” he admits.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences we know today as cyberbullying are not foreign to the young boy.
A relative of one of my friends was hacked on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money from him.
“He never knew who it was,” he said.
The victim, according to José, did not close his account.
"He only passed it on to a private profile."
He then explains a series of manipulations to set up his account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would post pictures of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would if I was angry or angry.
“Even though I know it’s cyberbullying,” he says.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English and a graduate in Education and Learning, believes that to guide children and adolescents, one must understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a means of searching for information, but with the advent of these sites, the rule of the game has changed," she said.
Porras reports that academic Marc Prensky, who holds a master's degree in pedagogy from Yale University and author of the book "Digital Natives and Immigrants", uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
It is the digital natives, children and young people who are born with technology.
“We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them there, while we are learning ourselves,” she says.
He adds that the topic is complex, "because we ask them to have a defined criterion on what it is appropriate or not to disclose, publish or say at an age where they do not have the necessary maturity to do so."
"We also ask them to be selective while what matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she added.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach privacy to children and adolescents is to use questions that make them think.
"To say not to do it is useless," she says.
Then Porras lists a few examples: there are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like them to post a photo of you like that of a friend you posted?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
When you identify holiday photos, do you ask other people for permission to identify them?
And also, does everyone need to know what you’re doing every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they need to act online as they do offline.
These are the same rules.
"In the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, it must be the same on social networks," she says.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary teacher and educational advisor, says it is essential that parents read the terms of use of social networks conscientiously.
By understanding each of the terms, they will have a solid basis for discussing with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
“For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish,” he says.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children not to talk to strangers.
The Unasur summit ended without the Lima Declaration being made public
The Sixth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without the Lima Declaration being made public, although it was previously announced and theoretically adopted by the 7 present delegates.
Efe has tried several times to access the document signed at the 6th Ordinary Meeting of the Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency initially reported that it would be disclosed after the end of the summit, then claimed that it would be published from time to time on the Internet.
When asked about the text, they reported that its contents had been exposed by Peruvian President Ollante Humala in brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information on the summit has been constantly restricted.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, audio restricted" was broadcast in the press room.
The little information that circulated among the journalists was that given by the press attachés of some of the governments of Unasur who attended the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document released during the day was the list of presidents present, which caused some discomfort among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who were demanding more important information.
Later, Peru’s presidency sent an email to the media with the summit’s “final statement,” but it was President Humala’s speech and not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the 3rd South America Arab Country Summit (ASPA) and, on that occasion, although it was requested with due process by the press, it had not released the declaration also called the Lima Declaration, as it had previously been announced.
On the official ASPA website, it can be verified that the document was published last March.
In both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to put in place safe transmission systems for all journalists, but they limited as much as possible the obtaining of information.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Hague Court that determines a different border between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era, Chile, met at the regional meeting and said they would respect the ICJ's decision to hear pleas from both parties in the trial Lima filed against Santiago, which begins Monday in The Hague.
"We will respect and execute the verdict that will resolve the disputes that we are bringing today before this international court," said President Humala, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
“Chile has always been, and will continue to be, a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of disputes, treaties, and international courts,” President Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era added, handing a hand to President Humala, alongside the flags of the two countries.
The two presidents' confirmation that they would submit to the ICJ came after Colombia denounced this week the Bogota Pact by which it agreed to submit to the decisions of this international tribunal, following a decision on maritime borders with Nicaragua that it considered to be gravely erroneous.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, Venezuela, Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the ouster of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was tasked with opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
He read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of action for 31 projects had been set between South American countries for a total investment of $17 million.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the countries of Unasur would put in place "important steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship by developing agreements on residence permits".
He informed that actions would be put in place to improve "cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organized crime, actions for better access to medicines, low-cost Internet access throughout South America, and to jointly and effectively assess the risks of natural disasters."
With a Europe in crisis, “economic consolidation (of Latin America) must not have a triumphant matrix but must help to increase our productive matrix and to envision a better future for our populations,” concluded President Humala.
"We have decided to prioritize a group of 31 iconic projects that improve the connection of South American spaces, especially in rural and border areas ... by uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits," the Peruvian president said in a speech.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five concerned Peru and were on the transverse axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two were aimed at a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not provide the fullest details.
Similarly, the final document mentions the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that this country's electoral process will allow for its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and with good relations with its neighbours, is another theme addressed at the summit.
In this regard, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said, before starting the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet with his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday in Mexico City to calmly discuss the maritime dispute through a decision of the ICJ requested by Bogota.
“It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday) I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega,” said President Santos.
"We are going to review all these avenues, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua that will ask for a discussion with that country," he said.
"I hope I can tell President Ortega that we will deal with this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," Santos said.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet Saturday in Mexico City, where they plan to attend the takeover of the country's new president, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto.
Similarly, as part of the summit, the bloc's defence ministers will meet in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of the Unasur, although the latter country is suspended.
Peru holds the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
“South America needs to learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship,” says Rafael Correa.
Ecuador’s President, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship was an objective for which “South America, in this case, should set an example on Europe”.
President Correa, who participated in the 6th Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), located in Lima, told state television, TV Peru, that Europeans "had intermarried during World War II" and other conflicts, "but that they now formed almost a homeland."
In this sense, he defended the project to establish a South American citizenship encouraged by the member countries of Unasur.
"Free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country must be achieved, as is already the case for the members of the Andean Community, but there are still some reactionary areas that we want to make belong to the past," he warned.
In addition, the Ecuadorian president supported the reconstitution of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account the signatories of the San José Pact on Human Rights.
Those who turn our ears never compromise anything, on the contrary, we South Americans have all signed it.
“It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under U.S. funding,” he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa said he did not regret his decision because he himself did not betray his principles, but instead respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He concluded that at the time, “there were well-founded suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected.”
In addition, he criticized the Swedish justice system that demanded that he submit in its territory to an interrogation regarding a presumed sexual offence while "the Swedish legislation allows it to be done by videoconferencing, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London".
Correa said there was a risk that Assange’s mental and physical health could deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, but nothing serious," he said.
It is possible that his physical and mental health deteriorates by being locked in a small space without being able to do outdoor exercises.
“It’s about everyone’s health,” he concludes.
Correa points out that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, which would be the award of a safe-conduit that would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European judicial authorities.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garz<0xC3><0xB3>n, has launched a series of proceedings with different European bodies," he said.
And he thinks that “if Britain granted safe driving tomorrow, it would end.”
And if Sweden, as its legislation permits, and as it has already done in other cases, would question Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, or question him via Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa took advantage of this to reassert himself as a defender of freedom of the press and he clarified that what he did not tolerate was "the mediocrity, bad faith and lies that harm freedom of expression."
“The greatest enemies of press freedom are not the evil or perverse politicians but the bad journalists at the expense of greed, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
From this point of view, he welcomed that it was not such journalists "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador" and, rather than highlight his re-election, "it would deepen the revolution to continue on the path and chart the right path".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto over Paraguay within the Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization "should be firm and not tolerate opportunism and disguised coup attempts", because in reality, "it destroyed the legitimacy paramocity".
Moreover, the Ecuadorian president considers as "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime borders between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which will strengthen the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua.
At the moment, this judgment is not respected.
This is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to move forward together.
We need to solve them as a whole in order to overcome them and move forward.
At the same time, he said he was confident in the proper resolution of the maritime border dispute between Peru and Chile in the same court and said it was “beneficial for Latin America to seize international bodies if the two countries agree to accept a judgment as firm as it is”.
Referring to the possibility of his nomination as a candidate for the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to run for a third consecutive term, he said that he saw this possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite difficult".
Correa assured that if he lost the February 2013 primaries, he would retire from public life.
On a personal level, power has never interested me, but in situations as unfair as those in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be solved through political power.
"My political movement believed that it was I who guaranteed this eventual victory, but we must accept this responsibility," he said.
If I win, it would be my last presidential term and then I will retire from politics.
If we ever lose, I will too.
"It's my decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
“This does not mean a relapse of President Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez’s health,” he said.
The Ecuadorian Head of State participated today in Lima at the 6th Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with a call for better regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when the test result was confirmed: HIV positive.
"It's as if the sky had fallen on my head," he said, referring to the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make "less painful", in vain.
The young man hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness on his own and began to learn about it and his hard work was such that he just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), in which he found himself in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something hard to imagine in the early 1990s, where there were many doubts, few treatment choices and more stigma.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he was voiceless".
At that time, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their illness, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, in any case after the first reported cases, "the great victory today is that the survival of a patient who has started treatment at the right time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same," said the head of the HIV unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva was this prestigious and he validated as a publication for information that this
Andrade Villanueva, HIV/AIDS expert, commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is no longer a deadly disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depends on the level of immune system involvement that patients had at the time of diagnosis, with better rates for those who do not use it, up to 30 years.
Simply put, this means that for someone who would receive a positive HIV diagnosis at age 25, “as long as he remains under control, he will be able to live without problems until age 75,” the scientist explained.
In order to put this progress back into context, it is necessary to know that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
While it is true that mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of AIDS deaths has increased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that, since the onset of AIDS, 60% of patients have been identified on the national basis.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and there were 187 deaths until May of this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
So why are there still deaths?
I don't think the problem is with access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened in our hospital.
In the last 12 years at least, we have never missed drugs, the problem is that patients get to very advanced stages because they do not know that they are infected, or else they learn it at advanced stages of the disease.
It gives us an indisputable fact "nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, what it takes to have a greater impact on global mortality is to make earlier diagnoses and, for this, we need to offer screening tests in a massive way, to all the people who ask for it".
The specialists and members of the State Council for AIDS Prevention of Jalisco (Coesida) agree on his proposal, as well as the patients themselves, like Fabrizio, who had to do his screening test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done it and that, despite his young age, he was already a sufferer of AIDS.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die and don't want to know anything.
“If I’m going to die, it’s better that I blow myself up three times a week,” they say, not my case.
The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medications.
To date, his parents only know that he suffers from cancer.
I have a normal life, just like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but co-responsible, I pay attention to myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid today, during the march of the World Day.
That they do the test, if they have taken risks, the sooner they will know if they are HIV positive and the better it will be, and if they already have the diagnosis, they need to know that we can live like everyone else, by being responsible.
His message sums up the slogan of the battle against AIDS in this year 2012.
Condoms on the counter
There are many gaps between health programs and the ordinary citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who embraced the cause of HIV.
And the biggest one is prevention.
In all the places dedicated to this, "we have actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now we are given packets of one hundred, that's fine, but as a result, today, some do not have access to condoms," he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
The question: "What are you going to do with it?", posed with sarcasm and valuable judgments by social workers, counsellors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that teenagers do not want to hear, the journalist assures.
It proposes to refocus this ineffective distribution; that condoms not only be sold at the counters, but that they be found in public toilet dispensers and in places frequented by young people.
It is not about encouraging promiscuity.
Nor is it about paying the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez had replied when asked if there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration.
"This is not how sexuality works, the best thing is to provide condoms to people who are already sexually active," he said.
The numbers in Jalisco
There were 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 of AIDS and 1,317 of HIV).
The state is the fourth state in the country in the number of new and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th in the number of HIV patients.
92% of the contamination is done sexually, 6% by blood and 2% by perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, since for each case recorded, there are 4 or 5 people who ignore it.
A U.S. court-appointed judgment on appeal ignores the restructuring of the Vitro Group’s debt through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico, setting a precedent that is detrimental to all domestic companies with branches in the neighboring country and with solvency problems.
Thus, it seems that the survival procedures of companies authorized by Mexican laws are not valid in the star-studded country, in contravention of international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the blow to the judgment handed down on June 15 by Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican companies defenseless against the possibility of embargoing their properties beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow Mexico’s leading glass manufacturer to sue the U.S. Supreme Court based on three inconsistencies.
First, while the judge in the case points out that creditors must register under the U.S. Bankruptcy Act, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, based in New Orleans, states that the main proceeding is the formalized commercial bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first point would involve denouncing international procedural cooperation in insolvency cases of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Commercial Law had been created for this purpose by taking the American Law Institute as arbitrator.
Second, the judgment establishes that without the inter-company voting, recognized in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, the debts contracted by subsidiaries of Vitro to the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring could not have been obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan.
There are a half-dozen examples here, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose Federal Institute of Commercial Bankruptcies had secured the debts.
Moreover, what is certain is that, since the votes of the subsidiaries remained, in any case the Vitro creditors who fought against it in the courts of the United States, i.e. the "valley" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained the majority.
The vote would have been 45 votes to 37.
A data omitted by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro has been blamed for the difficult situation he has faced since 2008 without stopping at the serious economic crisis facing the United States, repercussing the costs to the country.
For the moment, the Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez Sada family society will appeal to the same court of appeal for the vote to take place in its entirety, that is, with the five magistrates, since only three had voted.
The insurance claim will require non-prosperity and requires a review of the trial by a higher court, in this case the U.S. Supreme Court.
The most serious is that the court ignored a document sent by the Mexican government on behalf of the amicus curiae ("friend of the Court") detailing Vitro's procedure under the Commercial Bankruptcy Act, noting that it freed him from the conventions signed by the two countries to bring it to the same level as paragraph 15 of the bankruptcy law.
In addition, he noted that the country had adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules for cross-border insolvency cases, which ensured fairness for debtors and creditors.
Two-part carambolage: they take over Vitro and they take over the country.

Gathered over the weekend at a University of the Caribbean amphitheatre, a group of national and foreign ecologists, university professors, entrepreneurs and members of civil society approved the creation of a broad front of opposition to the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a colossal sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the Great Wall, with a residential area for the employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had succeeded in uniting the governors of the Southeast Zone to oppose the monumental project, which is partly in protected areas and represents the greatest of all threats to industry.
The ACTA is dead.
The government has put forward a Senate requirement to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan had signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by its English acronym as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this theme is already ancient history.
As everyone knows, it was well done that the Senate itself condemned this possibility, as it was seen as a violation of freedom of expression on social networks.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes "Basketball is my whole life"
Basketball wrestler "Hetin" Reyes has spent more than 60 years of his life in relation to the field and, thanks to him, has traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of local basketball as great as that of Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason for this is that before a cerebral hemorrhage sentenced him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in this sport for more than 60 years, whether as a lower league player, national basketball team player, manager and leader of the national team, the BSN president, with both the Cowboys of Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n and the Cowboys.
"I've worn several caps in basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, like when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the national team and president of the federation during the 1990s," Reyes recalls during a visit to Primera Hora at his home in Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n, where he lives with his fiancée Isabel, his 50th wife.
“Basketball has been my life.
Reyes doesn't exaggerate when he makes that claim.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and souvenirs that remind his itinerary out of standards, testify to this.
Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n in the heart
Of all his memories, the ones he loves most are those that remind him of his time as a player in the Vaqueros team in the mid-1950s until 1982, after spending 15 years as a co-manager or manager of the team.
"It was my best years, the ones I took the most advantage of because I had the chance to participate in eight Vaqueros championships starting in 1967, whether as a manager, co-manager or manager.
This makes many years of satisfaction, including the five championships played from 1971 to 1975.
I then retired at the championship in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy joined the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took the lead of the team," says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who was the leader here at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), who told me, "I have a tough player for you, he's two meters tall.
Do you want it?"
This is how to start Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has had.
Bartow then recommended me Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and who was one of the best shooters.
I remember him saying that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win a championship, Gauss would help us try to win another.
He enjoyed the championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse, but only at a distance since in 1988 he was already the great manitou of the federation.
At the time, he preferred to take advantage of his and Mincy's positions in the national team.
I remember when we won it for the first time in the United States at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico City in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we came 4th and where we should have won the bronze medal if this Canadian judge hadn’t made us play the last game again,” Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, just like the one who beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite is that of the Pan American Games of Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and put a scratch on the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that had won the bronze at the World Cup.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico L<0xC3><0xB3>pez and "Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n" (Ortiz), there were also the young (Javier) "To<0xC3><0xB1>ito" Col<0xC3><0xB3>n and James Carter, the brothers Le<0xC3><0xB3>n (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had no reason to attend the World Cup.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and great joy at the pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitier replacing the players suspended by the imbroglio of the Pan American Games of Mar del Plata, we have won gold against all odds.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, this is Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n Ortiz.
His statistics at the international tournament level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level like Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n did.
And this without taking into account his trajectory in the different leagues for which he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's very hard to say.
We had a good team composed of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In the youth, I really like the work that Leo Arill does.
For you, what is your greatest success within the federation?
Having been part of the most glorious time of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s, the BSN had up to 17 teams in one season.
What do you have to do?
There are things I would like to put in place, such as the regionalization of minor categories.
For example, the Ponce boys only play in their area and only face teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Today, young people travel and play too much when it is not necessarily necessary.
I have at least seen the benefit of mandatory certifications and courses for leaders, field staff and arbitrators.
It makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, I watch clips from my time on YouTube, I enjoy my grandchildren and, from time to time, I watch basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been by my side.
The Death of Actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became known worldwide for the lead role of John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he played a unscrupulous, fearsome and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as unscrupulous oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who had returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas," died Friday night of complications from cancer, according to a family statement sent to The Associated Press for Warner Bros., the production house of "Dallas."
"Larry was back in his dear hometown of Dallas, playing the ironic role he loved most," the family said.
Larry’s family and close friends were with him in Dallas on this Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played his wife in the original series and later, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, her press attaché, Jeffrey Lane, said.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented, and I will miss him a lot.
“He was an exceptional person and he lived life to the fullest,” Gray said in a statement.
Doctors had diagnosed liver cirrhosis to Larry Hagman in 1992 and he had admitted to drinking a lot for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant liver tumor and had a transplant.
Several years before "Dallas", Hagman had made himself known on television as an ordinary guy in the series "Jinny of My Dreams" broadcast on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a seductive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and brought her home.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film roles include critically acclaimed roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was thanks to his masterful interpretation of the deliciously detestable J.R. that Larry Hagman was most successful.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and their loved ones aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who Killed J.R.?", invented to entertain the suspense around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost murdered, has generated speculation around the world and millions of dollars played in betting.
Thanks to this, among others, the series reached a record audience at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screens and made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had gathered 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. had made her pregnant and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but other people also had reasons to assault her.
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a dishonest businessman and an infidel husband who was trying to imprison his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
“I know what it would take as an epitaph for J.R.,” Hagman said in 1988.
We should write, "Here's the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only part he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as a "huge man, both on the small screen and in life."
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the heart of each of us, who have had the chance to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" aired a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes is already finished for the second season and a sixth is underway, the channel reported.
At the moment, neither Warner nor TNT have communicated on how Hagman's death will be integrated into the series.
Originally from Fort Worth, Texas, he is the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who gained fame with classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to her in 1931 when she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He took his first steps on the New York theatre scene in the early 1950s and served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
It was there that he met the young Swedish interior decorator Maj Axelsson and he married him.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
“I didn’t write anything in this book that could hurt anyone or affect them in any way,” he told reporters at the time.
After his liver transplant, he became an active organ donation activist and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist concerned patients.
"I advise them, I give them back confidence, I come with them when they come for surgery and after," he said in 1996.
I try to offer them a little comfort, like, "Don't be afraid, it won't be easy for a while, but it's going to be okay."
He has also been an anti-tobacco activist and has participated in several campaigns.
A course on the "End of the World" has just begun
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to give a lecture on the end of the world, he knew that he was throwing an irresistible hook there: the end of the "great reckoning" of the Mayan calendar, on December 21, to which many people refer as proof of the imminent end of the world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea what was waiting for him in the following months: Hurricane Sandy, a fiscal gulf that some have dubbed "the Armageddon of Debt" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where end-time Christian theorists thought it would trigger.
“I didn’t realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester I’ve ever known,” Professor Charmé told his students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If we analyze what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and we recount it, it was a very good period.
And it must be remembered that what is bad is good for those who believe in the Apocalypse.
And he's not the only professor to give lectures on "the end of the world" this semester, which will, in theory, be the last in history.
In Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
“We are analyzing this because these ideas proliferate over time,” he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios guides some human behavior.
If nuclear weapons fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared to real-life examples.
“I tried to inform my students about what was possible, probable, credible and impossible,” Vacker said.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Latin American History Professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of Art History and Anthropology, teamed up to give a course, simply titled "The End of the World".
"We are adding '2012' to have the opportunity to give the course again, in case the world doesn't disappear," said Professor Restall.
Despite the "imminent disaster", students must study, create projects and pass their final exams.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be passed on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work "until the very night of the supposed end of the world," Restall said.
The courses proved to be quite popular.
“It was complete in two hours,” said Restall about his high-level student course, which was comprised of 35 students.
We received emails several weeks before the start of the semester from people asking if there was still room.
Students, for their part, assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“It fascinates me to see what people are able to do to comfort themselves,” said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student of religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers-Camden University.
For the fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, claims to have watched all the apocalyptic movies.
“I had never heard of a course that taught this subject,” he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students interviewed, let alone one professor, told us to believe in the end-of-the-world date of December 21.
“Our first project dealt with Mayan prophecy, and in a way we discredited it,” says Julie Zegle, a 21-year-old senior student at Temple, who is from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world, it’s just a key date on the calendar, Restall said.
But I concede that there is an apocalypse-related anxiety in Western culture, dating back several centuries, that causes people to react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a surge in these speculations.
“In other parts of the world, people don’t think about it,” he says.
This is mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who is teaching in the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he knew there were classes on "the end of the world".
“The Philippines is not participating in the end of the world,” he said, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restall notes that over the years, we have talked about the many supposed dates of the Last Judgment, and he says that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing about the fact that December 21 marks the beginning of a 7-year period at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date lightly.
Many told us that they thought they were going to "end of the world" parties.
"Sometimes I call friends and we laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
