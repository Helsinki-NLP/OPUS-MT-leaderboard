Barack Obama is the fourth US president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
U.S. President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo for 26 hours to take over the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth U.S. president in history.
He will receive a diploma, a medal and a check for $1.4 million, among other things, for exceptional efforts to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House will fly to the Norwegian metropolis in the morning with his wife Michelle and will be busy.
First, he visits the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time five members of the committee, which in October selected him from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple then has a scheduled meeting with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit will culminate in a ceremony at which Obama will receive a prestigious award.
He will be the fourth president of the United States, but only the third to win the award directly in office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will be talking about the Afghan war when he accepts the award.
The president does not want to avoid this issue, because he realizes that he is taking the prize as president, who is currently at war in two countries.
The war effort a few days ago increased by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which will not forget to highlight any of its critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque for ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to put on charitable purposes, but has not yet decided on a specific charity.
The packed program will then introduce the president to the banquet, where, in addition to the Norwegian king and queen, the Prime Minister and 250 other invited guests will also be present.
From the very beginning, Obama was more cautious about the price.
He said, for example, that he feels that he does not fully deserve it.
He also repeated several times that it is not a price for him alone, but for all who strive for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he said it was a "challenge to action" for him.
Protector of Nature Accused of Blackmail
Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police accused the president of the civil association of the Society of Nature Protectors of Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice of extortion.
In several cases in the past year, he appealed to some construction procedures, for withdrawing the appeal he demanded money from investors for his own benefit, said regrettable police spokeswoman Alena Romov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The Chairman of the Litomer Society of Nature Conservationists is Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
He is now in custody and faces up to three years in prison.
Sorting containers Brno does not smell much
In Prague, ordinary people can sort the packaging of drinks, in South Moravian villages you will meet sorting containers at every step.
And in Brno?
There, you can reserve a few minutes before you find a suitable trash can.
I don't want to say that the waste in Brno would not be sorted at all.
But I find that the fact that we are the second largest city in the republic, councillors are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is in the forest sorting league not only because, as citizens, we can still throw only paper, glass and plastic into sorting containers, but above all because of the number of trash cans for such waste.
Have you ever tried, for example, throwing a PET bottle into a collection basket?
It's a ready-made knob, mostly it takes time and nerves.
The only place I have come across so far is in Moravsk<0xC3><0xBD> n<0xC3><0xA1>m<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD> opposite Potrefen<0xC3><0xA1> Husa.
Don't let Mr. Onderka and his colleagues get mad at me, but I don't think that's going to happen.
Not to mention that there is no honey in other parts of the waste sorting.
A lot of my friends don't like to sort out the waste.
From laziness.
They are far from the garbage.
I'm not surprised.
After the party, I offered to throw away a few glass and plastic bottles.
But on Kounicova street I did not see any colored garbage cans in sight.
Fortunately, I came to the right place on the way to the scarf.
However, the waste flowed from it.
After all, it is still the center of Brno, which perhaps represents the city the most, right?!
However, ecology and some aesthetics probably do not interest the Brno socialists very much.
They would rather buy the city a hockey extraliga, which will embarrass us all over the republic, than buy a few extra containers and offer the sorting of other raw materials for cleaner Brno.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my assumption after a while surfing the Internet with official statistics.
According to EKO-KOM data, Brno is the worst in the entire South Moravian region.
"Parubk's" budget took the money for pensions and the sick
After the left has added, despite the opinion of the government, to farmers or officials, there may be no money in the budget for pensions, sick or building savings.
But also on interest on public debt or on international legal disputes.
It will cause problems for those who will rule in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists promoted the increase to some groups, they relied on the government to lend additional sensitive spending, pensions, or sick leave. "It's just a postponement of problems into the future, laying mines," says Janota.
The interest on the borrowed money is increasing and sometimes it has to be returned.
The state has no choice where to go.
If they do not reduce social benefits or the cost of running the state, they must raise taxes.
To everyone the left has now added: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And then their children too.
People don’t have to worry about pensions or sick payouts that have lost 1.8 billion dollars, they’ll get them.
But at the cost of getting more debt from the state – next year there will be only 163 billion in the treasury, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will grow faster and with it the cost of interest.
The state will need the money to pay for it, and it will no longer be enough to slightly raise VAT or lower its parent, as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
Due to the transfer of money in favour of several groups of voters, five billion will also be missing for the construction of highways and railways next year.
These are mainly already contested and disassembled sections, which can not be redesigned and possibly discounted.
To reserve at most, which is also not free.
It means delaying or stopping 30 large buildings, and it also threatens the extraction of European money, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD proposed that the loss of money be solved in shalamounsky – it reaches the dividends of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ, which the state owns from most of them, and from them it adds to the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never certain, and it is no longer a bottomless resource.
Last year, 18 billion came from <0xC4><0x8C>EZ to the budget.
Each year, the dividends are paid for the elimination of environmental damage, the pension account is supplemented by them or they serve as a reserve for the upcoming pension reform.
Moreover, according to EU rules, this trick increases the real budget deficit to 5.7 percent of GDP.
But the carnival does not end there.
Nearly three billion were lost in the budget to various compensations for victims of communism and crime or to expenses for litigation, even construction savings.
Whether the state will survive without this money is not certain.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international dispute, we will have to pay for it anyway, says Janota.
The minister will then have to save money inside the resort or, in the worst case, tap into the government’s budget reserve.
A hundred million is also missing for the already launched two-billion-dollar project of the Treasury, which is supposed to allow online to monitor what individual authorities are spending on.
The first phase will start in January.
If the finance minister could not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to stop, sanctions would come, warns Janota.
Your next smartphone will handle two operating systems
In the future, Americans are counting on a mobile phone on which the user will press a single button to switch between different operating systems.
Revealed plans sound promising.
Just press one key and from Windows Mobile you can move to Android in a few seconds.
This is exactly what the American company VMware aims to do, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to upload two user profiles to your mobile device at the same time.
You can switch between them, you can divide them into home and work.
They will both work at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and it was shown for the first time a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization of smartphones is not a fiction.
VMware has already successfully unveiled a test sample of a smartphone with two operating systems to journalists.
It was a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB of RAM, which ran alongside the aforementioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
VMware is now working with European and U.S. operators to test smartphone virtualization, and the devices are expected to reach customers in 2012.
Lack of snow in the mountains afflicts hoteliers
Bare slopes do not only worry the Giant Mountains skiers.
The lack of snow also discourages people from booking ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
That’s why in the Giant Mountains you can still get free rooms for all winter dates including Christmas and New Year’s Eve.
We have a lot of visitors to our site.
People go through offers, find prices, but so far they are afraid to order bindingly.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if we think this year Christmas will be in the snow or in the mud," said Martin Jandura, the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info.
Those who want a New Year's Eve stay in Spindleruv Mlyn exactly according to their expectations should no longer hesitate with the order.
Whoever prefers to save money and the quality of accommodation is only in second place, he can still try to wait a few days.
<0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>vsk hoteliers so far offer for New Year's Eve mostly only weekly stays.
I think they will try to marry them for a while, but then they will allow and go for a shorter time.
And then the free rooms will quickly disappear," Jandura estimated.
Free beds in all winter periods are still offered by the Ingtours travel agency in Vrchlab.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not yet sold out.
Half of the seats in our offer are still available.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays at the last minute," said Petr Schiefert, director of Ingtours.
New Year's Eve in the Giant Mountains can still be offered by the Vrchlab tourist office, but there are fewer places available.
The first fourteen days of February are also good for sales, the remaining winter terms are sold on average.
This year’s interest in winter stays has a negative impact on the fact that there is still no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting for him to attack.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the pistes are snowy during the week, Christmas will also sell out," says Schiefert.
On the contrary, a little better than last year they manage to occupy the rooms of the Horizont hotel in Pec pod Sn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>kou.
We're about five percent better at it.
We have the last few places for New Year’s Eve and Christmas.
There is a great interest in the Polish holidays in January and February is selling well," Karel Rada, the director of the best peck hotel, said.
Of the eighty percent of New Year’s Eve stays, the Omnia Hotel is also occupied by the central parking lot in Janské L<0xC3><0xA1>zn<0xC4><0x9B>.
On the contrary, at Christmas, half of the beds are still available in the latest Janskolazen hotel.
We were pleasantly surprised by January this year, which we already have at this moment about sixty percent occupied.
February is a little weaker so far, but once the snow hits, interest in stays in the Giant Mountains will certainly increase, said hotel manager Omnia Erik Sporysch.
However, for the greater part of the snow, the Giant Mountains hoteliers have yet to let their taste go.
On Thursday it is supposed to cool, if there will be any precipitation, so in the mountains should be snow.
But then the warming will come again, informed Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Jakubsk<0xC3><0xBD> from the castle workplace of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
U.S.: Repetition is the Mother of Wisdom
It’s funny how Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of being the smartest, repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, which he considered to be the dumbest.
When he finally debunked his long-awaited Afghan doctrine, it turned out that he had written it over a copy machine from Bush’s Iraqi script three years ago.
Not only did he use the phrase “as in Iraq” several times in the text itself, but he did not even hesitate to use the name of Bush’s January 2007 statement as the name of his own declaration: “A New Way Forward.”
Three years ago, he criticized Bush’s idea of sending fresh military forces to Iraq, suffering from the civil war, as “irresponsible and, in its aftermath, catastrophic.”
The following months, however, showed that Bush’s strategy, based on the recommendations of the field commanders, was the only one possible and so successful that there is no talk of Iraq in the news sessions today.
This did not improve Bush’s reputation, but objectively left his successor in a much more grateful starting position than could be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will happen again.
He was again requested by field commanders, in particular Afghanistan’s Operation Commander General Stanley McCristal, who, despite subordinate customs, harshly criticized the hesitant gunmen in the White House.
He asked 40,000 men to break the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but he could not think of anything better, and so at least he dressed the general by 10,000 soldiers.
He was able to squeeze another 5,000 promises out of Europe, even though he initially counted at least 10.
The most problematic of the entire Obama strategy seems to be his intention to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and to end this process in three years. The entire Obama doctrine raises more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that a half-increase will bear the same fruit as the progress in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal war of recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well organized, its leaders honoring the agreements.
The Afghan situation is characterized by the opposite symptom - no one can be trusted and no agreements are observed.
Under these conditions, the Afghan security forces, accustomed every day to changing their masters as they see fit, are preparing poorly.
Political institutions, even if formally established, will remain only a village in Timor-Leste for which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to flourish.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extraordinarily difficult given the opaque conditions that further complicate Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the construction of an "accessible state", which is the minimalist goal of the whole operation, does not seem too realistic.
The time horizon of Obama’s strategy is striking with its voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is now on the verge of an explosion.
To believe that soldiers sent into a war rage for the purpose of "quickly returning home" will cause the miracle done here, can only the soul truly romantic, untouched by reality.
From a political point of view, it is irresponsible to set a date for the withdrawal of troops, as the Taliban will perceive it as an indirect admission of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit has shown that Europeans’ willingness to participate in combat operations in Afghanistan is declining.
European politicians do not know and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is related to the war in the foothills of the Hindu Kush.
Another factor capable of radically intervening in the situation is the development of events around Iran.
If the situation continues to worsen and the increased sanctions do not affect Iran, the question before the United States is whether or not to try to solve the problem by military force.
It will be necessary to respond to it just at a time when, according to Obama, America is stepping up to a victorious withdrawal from Afghanistan.
However, any such solution will also mean a dramatic reversal in the Afghan situation.
The only plaque for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years left before the presidential election, and therefore there is still enough time left for him to come up with another strategy if it turns out to be a total failure.
Goldman Sachs managers no longer receive cash rewards
Senior executives at Goldman Sachs will not receive cash rewards this year.
This was announced by the company, which thus reacts to sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers will receive shares instead of money, which can be sold first in five years.
In addition, the shares can be taken away from managers if they take excessive risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is at the forefront of trying to combine Wall Street rewards with long-term performance.
I think Wall Street is well aware of the broader direction that needs to be taken, said former JPMorgan investment banker Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after it set aside nearly $17 billion in rewards for the first three quarters of this year.
According to Reuters, the company’s total remuneration for this year is likely to exceed $20 billion, despite the measure announced today.
With the onset of the financial crisis, high rewards in the banking sector have become a hot political issue in a number of countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it intends to charge bankers’ bonuses in excess of <0xC2><0xA3>25,000 (approximately CZK 712,000) at a single rate of 50%.
France is also making similar moves.
This year, women won the Nobel Prize in all fields except physics.
The record five women in Stockholm today took over from the hands of the Swedish King Carl XVI. Gustaf this year’s Nobel Prize in professional categories and for literature.
Among the four scientists was German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their compatriot, Jack Szostak, for their research on chromosomes.
Israeli Ada Jonath, along with American Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, were awarded the Chemistry Prize for clarifying the structure and function of ribosomes.
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to Elinor Ostrom of the United States and Oliver Williamson of the United States for her analysis of economic governance.
The only professional category that went without a holder this year was physics.
This award was presented today by scientists Charles Kao for their research in the field of optical fibers and George Smith and Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical telescopes.
Each awardee received a diploma, a Nobel medal, and a certificate of financial reward.
For each category, this amounts to ten million Swedish kronor (approximately 25 million CZK).
If there are more rewards in each of them, they share the reward.
The most traditionally expected Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to US President Barack Obama this afternoon in Oslo, Norway.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy of his esteem, as he is only at the beginning of his path and, moreover, he is at the head of a country that is waging two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In defense of his policies, however, he added that wars are in a certain situation necessary to win peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering resigning. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus will receive Finance Minister Eduardo Janot on Friday morning, who is considering staying in the government because he does not agree with the form of the state budget for next year as approved by the House of Representatives on Wednesday.
It is expected that the budget and perhaps even Janot's stay in the cabinet will be the topics of their Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
He said the deficit was too high, further exacerbating the public finance crisis.
The meeting was announced by the President's spokesman Radim Ochvat.
Janota wants to discuss his next stay in office with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
Under the budget law, which Klaus will now get to sign, the Czech Republic should manage a deficit of CZK 163 billion.
But on Wednesday, the House agreed to the left's proposals to move money and raise money for salaries of state employees, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government has denounced the proposals of social democracy as a covert increase in the budget deficit.
Between the left on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right on the other, a sharp internal political dispute has arisen because of this, which begins to question the further activities of Fischer's official cabinet, on which the formation of the ODS, <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and Strana were agreed in the spring.
Critics argue that the budget, as the House has adopted it, is essentially liquidating a package of austerity measures that the Fischer government put in place in the autumn, which it says is intended to stop the government from indebtedness.
Klaus, who can, but doesn’t have to, sign the state budget law, said at a luncheon with businessmen that politicians had long neglected a “serious problem” that is an “unsustainable deficit” of public finances.
He says he no longer has a good solution.
Improvements could only be made by a strong government, which could also rely on a broader consensus of political parties, the president said.
ODS Chairman Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek said that the budget is frightening and the government should consider further existence.
Deputy ODS Chairman Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, ODS and the Greens is clearly no longer working.
Prime Minister Fischer, in response, called similar words "strong statements".
<0xC4><0x8C>SSD chief Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek reacted to Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nka by saying that the budget deficit prepared by the former Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nka government for this year is frightening and exceeds 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD marked the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success.
The people were also pleased.
Clint Eastwood is playing Morgan Freeman.
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus: The Undefeated will tell the world a lot about the country, its struggles and victories despite some criticism that the main roles are played by American actors.
It tells the story of sport, race, and Nelson Mandela.
A tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, in his life story is portrayed by Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said ninety-one-year-old Mandela asked if he could play him in Eastwood's film.
Matt Damon plays a major role in this.
I told him, 'When I play you, I'm going to have to have access to you.
The twenty-seven-year-old actor, who won an award for his role in the Eastwood drama from the boxing environment Million Dollar Baby, has already portrayed, for example, the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, who eventually became a slave, a fictitious president of the United States and even a god in the Divine Evan.
The former South African statesman was jailed for 27 years for his active work to end apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and then became the country’s president for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word for the undefeated and is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him.
The film is a true story about how Nelson Mandela joined forces with South African rugby team captain Francois Pienaar to help unify the country. Newly elected President Mandela knows that his nation is still racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He believes he can unite his people through sport, so he decides to unite the rugby players who belong on a global scale among the outsiders.
The South African team will eventually advance to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandel's story on screen.
“I had no other goal than to play this role in order to bring it as close to reality as possible,” Freeman said.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would try to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to shake Mandela's hand.
I found that when I pressed your hand, I was picking up your energy, it was transferring, and I felt like I knew how you were feeling, he said.
It is important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team dominated by white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough world of rugby.
It was a big surprise for him when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember when I rang the home bell, it opened for me, and the first thing I said to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar in my life was, 'I look a lot bigger in the movie.'
Despite the obvious differences in the characters of the actors compared to their real models under the direction of Eastwood, Invictus: Undefeated gained positive reviews and there is talk of ambitions for the Oscars.
Film critic of the Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summed up his review in the words: "It was a very good story, a very well made film."
In film reviews on rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The secret of the glow over Norway unraveled: Russians tested the rocket
Above Norway it was possible to observe a special light effect of unknown origin.
Russia’s Defense Ministry said on Friday it was testing an intercontinental ballistic missile near the Norwegian border.
However, the launch was again unsuccessful and the projectile designated as the "Bulav" type, which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army, is slowly becoming a black nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even his repeated presence in the missile tests did not have an adequate effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava usually did not take off at all or was damaged in the air.
In Russian newspapers, "Bulava" is already described as a "missile that does not fly".
A rocket that doesn't fly but shines
At first, the 13th attempt was normal.
At the end of the flight, the aircraft was again technically damaged.
Apparently, the engine exploded in the third stage of the rocket.
This time "Bulava" took off from the atomic submarine Dmitry Donsky, which sailed under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile allows firing from the vessel, which is in motion and at the same time immersed.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light above Norway caused by an unspecified flying object was indeed a faulty "Bulava".
After all, the Norwegians did not doubt from the first moment that it was a Russian missile.
This time, the generals are defending themselves and claiming that one cannot speak unequivocally of failure.
The first two stages of the rocket lasted, and the accident hit only the third.
In previous cases, the motors failed in the first stage.
Although not a single test start has taken place without fault, only six out of thirteen consider the leadership of the Ministry of Defense to be unsuccessful.
Almost fifty percent of the success, therefore, fills the generals with optimism and thus still maintains that "Bulava" will once fly without problems and that it will even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks with a maximum total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract in CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
Legendary defender Vyacheslav Fetisov will once again appear in a professional hockey match at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic winner and Stanley Cup holder will help his team CSKA Moscow in the emergency and will probably start in the Friday duel of the KHL against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov, who ended his career at the age of forty in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After Denis Kulja<0xC5><0xA1> got hurt, we need another defender.
Fetisov regularly trains and agreed to help the team.
We just need to resolve some formal issues, the AP quoted Moscow club coach Sergei Nemchinov as saying.
It is not yet clear whether the comeback of the famous hockey player will relate to only one match.
I think that Fetisov is one of those who can elevate the spirit of other players, said Nem<0xC4><0x8D>inov.
According to the AP, Fetisov will become the oldest Russian professional hockey player in the event of a return to the ice.
In the NHL, he played the entire season for Hartford's legendary striker Gordie Howe at the age of 15, scoring 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
In the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic gold medals, seven World Cup titles, and won both the Canada Cup and the Junior World Championship.
In the second half of his career, he was successful in the NHL, where he twice lifted the Stanley Cup in a Detroit jersey.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai has agreed to trade unions. Will cancel all overtime
The management of the Hyundai sports car company has agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It was precisely because of the often ordered overtime that the trade unions declared a strike emergency on Monday.
This was confirmed by Hyundai spokesman Petr Vanek.
However, the management wants to agree with the unionists on another Saturday shift this year.
We cannot renounce our production plan, it is essential, that is why a voluntary overtime was proposed on Saturday, December 19, with two shifts being made, Vanek said.
Server Sedmi<0xC4><0x8D>ka.cz wrote that the company of employees who work the Saturday shift, offered a bonus of 400 CZK.
People will get this back on Saturday, November 28th.
According to Vanek, the company decided to change the way of motivating employees during the proposed overtime.
They either let themselves be repaid for overtime or they can choose a replacement holiday on December 28, and thus extend the Christmas holidays by a day, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shift will receive paid fare and lunch.
Since overtime was the most urgent and heartening point in terms of comments and complaints from trade unionists and protesting employees who stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect to cancel all overtime work.
Until last week, the company’s employees were forced to work almost every day after an eight-hour shift for another two-hour overtime.
After the signing of the agreement, the unions will call off the strike emergency
The next meeting between the company and the union is scheduled to take place on Friday morning.
Trade union chief Petr Kucha<0xC5><0x99> said on Wednesday that if they agree to meet the requirements and sign a joint document, they are ready to cancel the strike readiness.
The situation in the car industry worsened last week on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike due to constant overtime.
They also protested against poor wage conditions and alleged harassment.
The management reiterated that overtime has to be done by employees to meet the requirements for car deliveries.
In their strike emergency announcement on Monday, trade unions also demanded that no sanctions be imposed on employees who stopped production last Wednesday.
In the area of overtime, the unions require the company to reduce overtime work to a minimum.
In addition, they want to pay 5,000 crowns for it this year.
The No<0xC5><0xA1>ov car company Hyundai now employs 2,000 people.
The company started serial production in November last year.
As of September this year, it has produced around 80,000 cars, and its current production capacity is 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also affects 'hardened' HIV viruses
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also affects viruses that have already gained immunity against drugs.
This fact in some cases outweighs the fact that the compound does not act as strongly on the common variant of the virus as some already available drugs.
AIDS disease cannot be cured yet.
However, patients can significantly prolong the life of a mixture of drugs that prevent the multiplication of HIV in the body.
However, their use is accompanied by a number of side effects.
In addition, incomplete suppression of virus multiplication results in the development of so-called resistant viruses, against which drugs are no longer effective.
The work of experts from the three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, from the University of Science and Technology in Prague and from the University of Heidelberg paves the way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metallocarborans act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metallocarboranes are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus differently than all drugs used today, and therefore can overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists come up with new ‘improved’ compounds prepared based on knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the viral protein.
Metallocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages consisting of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Treacherous and Resistant Virus
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease caused by HIV cleavage, there would be no ripe infectious virus particles.
When we stop HIV protease, we will also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In a paper published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic chain, which is further systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was tested in the tube and also against its resistant (resistant) variants obtained from patients infected with HIV.
The effect of metallocarboranes on the normal variant of the enzyme is not as strong as that of clinically used drugs, but it does not lose its effect for resistant variants against which the drugs used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action and also their other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications thus from metalocarboranes make interesting compounds for further research aimed at the design of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavl<0xC3><0xAD>na <0xC5><0x98>ez<0xC3><0xA1>tav<0xC4><0x8D>ov<0xC3><0xA1> scient<0xC3><0xA1>, Head of the Biologics and Biologics Academy of Sciences, Head of the Laboratory of Biology and Laboratory of Biology.
Dispute over budget. ODS went to Fischer, he defends
ODS chief Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek called the approved budget for next year "terrifying" and said the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider further existence.
The Prime Minister called the ODS statement a strong statement.
He says he's taking the time to analyze.
Deputy ODS Chairman Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as said that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, ODS and the Green Party clearly no longer works.
The Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to support a minority in the House, which is fighting a growing deficit, or whether he wants to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approach of SDGs and social democracy to the issue of public deficits is diametrically different, Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as pointed out.
The House on Wednesday approved the 2010 budget, but with left-wing amendments for more than CZK 12 billion.
The House increased the money for the salaries of state employees, for the operation of social services and for direct payments to farmers.
The government’s move to address the proposals for social democracy was to covertly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The SDGs left the chamber before the vote, thus meeting the government's wishes, that even the amended budget is a less bad option than the budgetary proviso.
Disappointment and vanity
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of vanity, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government would assess the current situation further.
He is of the opinion that if Janota were to seriously threaten to step down if the amendments were to be adopted, the situation could have been different.
According to Czech Television, Janota ordered the prime minister on Monday after the government.
He said he was considering a further stay in office.
The reason is his disappointment with the budget negotiations.
If Fischer advocates further combating the budget deficit, according to Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as, the nominees of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, which enforced the changes in the budget, have nothing to do with the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House approves other deficit-enhancing laws, such as those relating to sick people, pensions, or the amendment to the Civil Service Act.
Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek: Ministers nominated by ODS did not blame themselves
It is a matter for Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS did nothing wrong, Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek stressed in a text message from the US.
He recalled that in several ministries, there are people in the post of deputy minister who applied for the TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
He stressed that if Fischer decides to resign from the principle of combating the public deficit, "it is absolutely logical and correct to rely on the left-wing majority that is currently in the House."
But he can’t count on the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I didn't think about it, and when it's up to date, I'll deal with it," Defense Minister Martin Bart<0xC3><0xA1>k told reporters in the House, who was nominated for the government by the Civil Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer left for the European Council meeting in Brussels this afternoon.
At the request of the Prime Minister, ODS resigned
At the same time, he stressed that the SDGs would apparently vote against the amended budget in the House on Wednesday if the Prime Minister did not explicitly ask the MEPs to allow the budget to be adopted.
We do not look like orphans, we are not small children, then he responded to the question of whether the ODS during the political negotiations on the budget did not burden the absence of the party president in the parliament and the Czech Republic.
I didn't realize my voice was missing.
Even when I was giving up my mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be primarily about the Bolshevikization of the House and the destruction of everything positive, Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek himself responded.
According to the new <0xC4><0x8C>D order, there will be fewer trains for almost the same fare
Czech railways will abolish or restrict some less crowded rapids and localities from December 13, while other connections will strengthen.
As of the date of entry into force of the new timetable, the total volume of transport will be reduced by two per cent compared to today.
Most tariffs, including basic and customer tariffs, will not change.
For example, the inhabitants of Ostrava will get more options to connect to the capital, the tracks on this route will add one set of pendolinos.
On the contrary, the high-speed train will stop driving to Bratislava.
There will also be less rapids on the route Prague - P<0xC3><0xAD>sek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, the direct connections Prague - Letohrad will be limited.
Of the regions, the railways are planning the largest reduction in transport in the Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lovéhradec region, a total of eight percent, on the contrary, Prague and the surrounding area can enjoy the increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - T<0xC3><0xA1>bor - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice route are also cancelled and the operation of several express trains on the Prague - P<0xC3><0xAD>sek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice route is limited to only a few days a week.
The biggest changes include the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, today Milovice has to move to Lys<0xC3><0xA1> nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth line of the suburban system Esko, its opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line from Lys<0xC3><0xA1> nad Labem to Milovice.
The long-distance connections to the capital will end at the Prague Main Station.
<0xC4><0x8C>D will introduce several SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava and trains to <0xC5><0xA0>umperk/Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k will run at two-hour intervals.
Passengers will no longer be able to commute to Bratislava by pendulum from December 13.
This year’s regional rail bill: 200 million more
The Ministry of Transport orders and pays for fast cars, in total to compensate for the so-called demonstrable loss will give the expensive next year four billion CZK, as this year. Locals are ordered by the regions, a total of eight billion CZK will be paid for them next year, contributing less than three billion CZK to the countries.
Regional trains are 200 million more expensive this year.
The tracks have a new 10-year contract for locals and fast cars, so far there has always been a one-year contract.
The trains are praising the system, which is why they have apparently not increased the prices of the overwhelming majority of tickets.
Changes will only occur with <0xC4><0x8C>D Net one-day network tickets and cheap eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka internet tickets.
For passengers without a customer card, the price of <0xC4><0x8C>D Net will increase from 450 CZK to 600 CZK.
The price of eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka will vary from the distance taken, so far it was uniform for travel between any regional cities and amounted to 160 CZK.
Philippine military still detains more than 50 people, children released
Armed men have kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including several elementary school students and their teachers.
According to AFP, only 65 abductees were reported.
All 17 detained children were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Some 19 gunmen are said to be using the hostages as a live shield while fleeing from the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to agree on the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the armed men belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is an armed component of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, the kidnapper was initially pursued by police because of violence that required the settlement of accounts between two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines in the province of Maguindanao, the recent massacre, which killed 57 people, has declared martial law.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre related to the elections to the governor's office were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of involvement in the massacre, the governor of this southern Philippine province and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan family, were arrested.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
But they resumed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The story of JAR concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the coming days, a new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood, Invictus (the official title in the Czech Republic is Invictus: Unconquered), which captures part of the life story of former South African President Nelson Mandela, will be released in theaters.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid was hosted by Morgan Freeman, who allegedly chose Mandela himself for his portrayal years ago.
The supporting male role of the legendary South African rugby champion Francois Pienaar was hosted by Matt Damon.
With the introduction of the film to the cinema, they emerge from the reviews of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on 18 July 1918 in South Africa.
In 1988, he received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, and in 1993, together with de Klerk, he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
high expectations, as it comes to the public at a time when the South African Republic is on top of preparations for the World Cup in football, but at the same time the media are shaken by disturbing reports of growing racial hatred and discrimination against the population by the Black ruling majority.
According to the AP news agency, the reviews of the new film in JAR are so far all positive, despite numerous reservations about the casting of the main roles by "frightened" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is proud of the new film.
I dreamed of this role for many years and was well prepared for it.
I have also met Nelson Mandela many times in person to - as they say - draw on his energy, he said in an interview after the film's premiere ceremony in Los Angeles.
I think it’s good if we can remind Mandela’s personality and message through film.
It is the story of the South African Republic, but it concerns every person, he added.
In the national rugby team jersey
The film is based on a book presentation by British writer John Carlin with the freely translated title In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game that gave rise to the nation portrays a South African human rights defender during his first presidential term.
Morgan Freeman, therefore, throughout the film, tries to blend two racial and for many years mutually defined groups of the population and, as in 1995 Nelson Mandela, he also enters the role of an actor in the South African national rugby jersey at the World Cup.
For entering the lawn in a jersey, which in JAR is understood as almost something sacred, Mandela reaped fourteen years ago the great ovation of the predominantly white audience and gained the recognition of the white population.
The football championship may be able to reunite people into one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in JAR will improve is yet to be revealed.
White South Africans, however, are skeptical, as rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to Britain, told LN in a recent interview.
The championship will start on June 11, 2010.
In Lounsk, a transformer burns for tens of millions of crowns
The fire was caught in the morning by the transformer of the company <0xC4><0x8C>eps in the power plant near the village of Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kov on Lounsk.
According to Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Marvan, a spokesman for the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> region firefighters, six units were involved in the fire.
Initially, the firefighters wanted to let the transformer burn out, but later reconsidered the opinion and the fire extinguishes a mixture of water, foam and special firing agents.
The cause was a technical failure, the internal shortcut of the transformer.
No one was injured, according to the spokesman of the company Pavly Mand<0xC3><0xA1>tov<0xC3><0xA1>, the accident does not threaten the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated at several tens of millions of crowns, accurately quantifying it will only succeed after the end of the fire.
According to the Mandate, the destroyed transformer will need to be replaced by a new one.
In the ten years of operation of the company <0xC4><0x8C>eps nothing like this has happened, the defects of this type are unique, she added.
Electricity supplies were not interrupted, according to <0xC4><0x8C>EZ’s spokesman for northern Bohemia, Soni Holingerov<0xC3><0xA1> Hendrychov<0xC3><0xA1>, and the operation of households, offices and companies was not affected by the fire at the gas station.
A.s. <0xC4><0x8C>eps operates on the territory of the Czech Republic as an exclusive transmission system operator, electric lines 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 distribution lines with 67 transformers converting electrical energy from the transmission system to the distribution system and the pipeline route with a length of 4,339 kilometers.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura submits criminal notice for libel to three heytmans from <0xC4><0x8C>SSD
The owner of Student Agency Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura today filed a criminal complaint for slandering three social-democratic heytmans.
And that is to Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek from the South Moravian Region, Radko Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nek from the Pardubice Region and Martin Tesa<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k from the Olomouc Region.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura reported it in Twenty Minutes of the Radio Journal.
The complaint is related to the company’s effort to operate regional train transport in some regions.
However, all the regions eventually signed long-term contracts with the Czech Republic.
All three of them are attacking us and talking about picking the raisins, while we brought an offer only for what they wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than Czech Railways, which is not true, because we know the prices of Czech Railways, which were closed last week.
So we have no choice but to defend ourselves.
It's for slander against the Student Agency, he told RadioJournal Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura.
At the same time, he said he had evidence from all regions that they had not taken their steps in accordance with European law.
It is therefore preparing an initiative for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the filing of the criminal complaint to be another continuation of Mr. Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura’s media show, which serves as an unpaid advertisement by his company and his own people.
I am, of course, ready to defend my good name and the good name of my region, and to the same challenge the other heytmans.
I assume that even on this occasion it will be clear that it is Mr Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura who manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport and uses false and untrue arguments, Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura announced last week that he is investing several million crowns in advertising, which will highlight the disadvantaged step of the regions.
He told the radio that he would stop the campaign after Christmas and want to continue it after the New Year.
He said the campaign would be directed against corruption as such.
The campaign started in Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura after the regions agreed to operate regional railway connections with the Czech Railways and did not sign tenders for a contract of around 150 billion crowns.
According to Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, similar conduct is illegal and contrary to the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of train transport in the regions, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>urov was already threatened by a member of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
The only threat was that if we don't stop, we could lose the bus license.
He introduced himself as a member of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, I know who the man is, I will not tell his name, he told Radiojournal Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura today.
Vaccination against pneumococcus will be free and optional
Vaccination against pneumococcus since January will break the old habits.
It should be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
But there are already voices saying that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcal peaks.
The Institute of Medicine has already set maximum prices for vaccines to be paid by health insurance companies.
Experts also have a clear understanding of the vaccination process.
New vaccinations
Free vaccines for August children
From January, children born on or after August 2 can be vaccinated against pneumococcus free of charge.
The condition is that they have not yet received a single dose of the vaccine.
Anyone who started vaccination last year or earlier must also pay for another revaccination.
The first dose of the vaccine must be given between 3 and 5 months of age.
Last year, a quarter of families had their children vaccinated against pneumococcal disease.
The parents paid 1,600 crowns for one dose and more.
Vaccinating the youngest children requires four doses.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance companies spend 300 to 450 thousand crowns per year on vaccination doses.
But it will save on the treatment that children without vaccination would need.
So far, the state has given around 500,000 per year for all large-scale vaccinations of children.
The vaccine was introduced by the so-called Janot package.
Pneumococcus causes inflammation of the middle ear, but also serious infections including inflammation of the brain membranes and blood poisoning.
According to research in hospitals, up to 28 children under the age of 10 will die from pneumococcal infections in our country in a year.
In addition to the Czech Republic, children have been vaccinated against pneumococcus in 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, however, there are opinions that this vaccination may be mandatory in the future.
As of January, it is to be paid by insurance companies and optional.
For example, the head of the civil society Nahlas Rudolf Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD> suggested that compulsory vaccination would be better.
His association has long been promoting pneumococcal vaccines.
The experts at the international conference that our association attended were not entirely satisfied with the fact that we have voluntary vaccination.
It's not exactly perfect.
On the other hand, we are glad that at least this has been achieved.
I think that’s the path we have to take now, Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD> said.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcal infections.
At the moment we are not thinking about it at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88>.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors say
The president of the Professional Society of Practical Physicians for Children, Hana Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1>, acknowledges that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, a reduction in the number of revaccinations could be considered "In a situation where this vaccine costs such a high amount, we quite understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as a voluntary," says Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Experts expect their babies to be vaccinated against pneumococcus from next year more than 80 percent of fresh parents.
Pneumococcal vaccination is also a breakthrough in that it is paid by health insurance companies, not the state, as the first large-scale vaccination of children.
Insurance companies should spend money on prevention, thus saving on further treatment, Cabrnoch explains.
Doctors will have to buy the drugs themselves
However, this is related to the concerns of practical pediatricians regarding the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original plan, the vaccines were to be purchased by insurance companies and doctors would receive them in the same way that the state supplies them with substances for other vaccinations.
However, some MEPs feared that insurance companies could "take money out of health insurance."
Doctors will therefore have to buy the substances and wait for the insurance companies to pay them back.
According to estimates, individual practical pediatricians will invest in vaccines 40,000 per month, which is a significant sum.
It’s not going to be easy, Cabrnoch says.
Son of American artist 'stealing in museum'
Frank Frazetta, the son of renowned American fantasy creator Frank Frazetta, has been charged with attempting to steal $20 million worth of paintings from his father’s museum.
Police in Pennsylvania said Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 images into his vehicle and trailer.
Mr. Frazetta and the other man used a bagr to break into a museum in the Poconco Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta senior, 81, was famous for creating the characters Barbara Conan and Tarzana.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, according to the Associated Press.
The AP quoted an unnamed police official as saying that Mr. Frazetta Jr. may have been motivated to act by long-standing family disputes.
In front of the police, Mr. Frazetta issued a younger sworn statement, aged 52, that he did so at the direction of his father, "to get into the museum in any way possible and move the paintings to reconciling spaces," the agency said.
Mr Frazetta senior refused to grant any such authorisation, as stated by the agency.
Labour opposes planned tax hikes
The ministers advocated tax increases and spending cuts announced in the preliminary report on the budget against criticism from the opposition, businessmen and trade unions.
According to Alistair Darling, the Tories have "missed" the opportunity to show that they are serious about delaying the decision to reduce the deficit until after the elections.
The Chancellor also came under fire for the disability of low- and middle-income workers.
According to his proposal, this is mainly a 0.5% increase in social insurance and a 1% adjustment in public payments since 2011.
Disagreements on Social Security
The unions protested that low-income workers were punished for a recession they didn’t blame and warned of “problems” in advance.
Social security is on the rise - an increase of around <0xC2><0xA3>3 trillion a year - which has angered the business community, who have said it is an employment tax while focusing on economic recovery.
This increase, which is limited to these incomes of more than <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
KEYBOARDS PBR
Social security will increase by another 0.5% from April 2011
The economic situation will worsen more than expected, by 4.75% this year
New taxation of 50% of bankers’ bonuses
1% increase in corporate depreciation tax for small businesses
Tax Reduction for Electric Vehicles and Wind Power Plants
Increase in pensions by 2.5%
According to the state financial administration, some revenues of <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 will decrease by <0xC2><0xA3>90 per year and some revenues of <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 will decrease by <0xC2><0xA3>190, while some revenues of <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 will increase by <0xC2><0xA3>110.
Ministers announced that their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 meant "difficult decision-making," but insisted that 60% of the special taxes should be paid to 5% of the highest-income people.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the proposed tax hike and spending cuts would be a "drop in the ocean" compared to what would have to be done.
"These are big numbers, and they will allow us to cut the deficit in half, which is an absolutely basic requirement for the next four years," he said.
Mr Timms said he believed that economic growth should occur at the turn of the year.
But drawing up a forecast for future economic growth — which will affect the amount of loans needed and how quickly the deficit will be reduced — must be taken into account after the chancellor was forced to revise previous amounts.
In that opinion, he said, the economic downturn this year was 4.75% — far worse than the 3.5% predicted in April — because loans were <0xC2><0xA3>3 trillion higher than previously estimated.
“A Wasted Opportunity”
Conservatives, who launched a new promotion campaign on Thursday, warning of a “debt crisis” of Labour, called the planned <0xC2><0xA3>789 trillion loan unaffordable over the next six years.
Ministers failed to present a credible plan on how to pay for it, they added, "cynically" postponed this decision until after the elections - which must take place by June 2010.
"They didn't add anything significant that would be feasible," said shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do it, but they wasted it."
"All important announcements will be made after the election if we win them."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from future cuts, unlike the Tory proposals, which would like to reduce the deficit faster and to a greater extent.
But liberal democrats argue that the money raised by raising taxes and cutting spending should be used to support spending next year, not to reduce the deficit, and argue that the plans are “grounded in the sand.”
BBC political commentator Nick Robinson said the timing of the announcement — for example, the above-mentioned inflation will increase and there will be an inability to pay benefits next April — that it could lead to the Chancellor’s indictment in the election campaign if money was difficult to get back a year later.
But Labour insists on providing special assistance if people are in dire need and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
‘Suspicious budget’
Although ministers did not disclose details of spending after 2011, economists said it was clear that a reduction in public spending would only be the beginning of medium-term constraints.
The renowned Institute for Budget Studies said the Chancellor’s figures suggest substantial cuts in many areas, potentially in the construction sector, include transportation, higher education, and defense.
"It's really very painful so far," said its director Robert Chote.
“All important statements will come after the election if we win them,” said Roger Bootle, economic advisor to Deloitte’s account manager.
"That was a report on a suspicious preliminary budget. Markets are implementing it."
FBI Investigates ‘U.S. Prisons in Pakistan’
The FBI is investigating five Americans in a Pakistani prison suspected of being linked to extremists.
The men were arrested for attacking a house in Sargoda in eastern Punjab province, the BBC reported on Tuesday.
The FBI said it was an investigation into whether these were the same men who had been declared missing in the last month at their home in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The U.S. State Department said it was also seeking information about the men.
Three of them are said to be of Pakistani origin, one of them has Egyptian ancestry and the other is from Yemen.
"If they were U.S. citizens, we would be very interested in the conditions under which they were detained and the circumstances under which they were detained," Kelly said in a statement.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was informed of the arrest and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their actions here and whether they are indeed missing students," she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of them.
He said the house had always been the focus of the local police and that no charges had yet been filed against the arrested men.
Secretary of State Hillry Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, Reuters reported, but said the United States must “work much more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan in uncovering the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people.”
The disappearance of these five students from a home in northern Virginia was announced by their families at the end of November.
Rejection of amnesty for the Iranians.
The human rights situation in Iran is as bad as it has been in the last 20 years, according to a report by Amnesty International.
The report details the "modes of torture" in the regime before and after the controversial presidential election in June.
One of the men said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, while the other said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has denied the above-mentioned criticism of the report on respect for human rights.
Officials described the criticism as politically motivated.
Thousands of people have been imprisoned and dozens killed in Iran following the controversial election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, leading to the largest street demonstrations since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
Dozens of them were arrested and the prosecutors sentenced the last five to death.
BBC correspondent John Leyne, now in London, said earlier in the protests, Supreme Leader Ajyatollah Ali Khomeini had declared some forms of torture illegal and banned their execution at the Karizak correctional facility.
But since then, almost no criticism of the legal power has been tolerated, as our correspondent stated.
“Untrue Confession”
Amnesty International cited a report by 26-year-old computer scientist Ibrahim Methari, who said he was accused of "working with Facebook" and protesting against the election results.
"Often they hit me in the face," he said in a statement.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... they threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and half unconscious, Amnesty said.
In August, the defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Charroub<0xC3><0xAD> was detained after the election protests and was tortured to death in prison and others were raped.
Iran’s top state officials denied the allegations of rape, but admitted that there was torture.
Amnesty also cited a case of a former prisoner who said he was held in a container with 75 other people for more than eight weeks at a prison in Kahrizak.
Amnesty International acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had set up committees to investigate post-election riots and government responses, but said the mandate and powers of the authorities were unclear and the findings of parliamentary committees were likely to be published.
The group said at least 90 people had been detained in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was created in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn the Bristol monument into a runway for the race.
The ski slope for the race in the park attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders to compete for financial prizes.
At the top of the piste in Brandon Hill Park, there was a short jumping bridge 100 m long before the piste.
Fourth-year medical student John Hickman said it was a beautiful view from the top of the runway, but that it was really depressing.
It was a beautiful view of the flashing lights of the city below.
There were some of the best skiers and snowboarders from all over the country - some of them real talents," he added.
The prizes were awarded for the best pieces - or maneuvers on the downhill track.
After Thursday night’s race, the snow was left to melt.

At a time when Swiss voters were calling for a ban on the construction of minarets and generally spreading alarming reports of the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote and informed and wondered whether Muslim continents could integrate - and whether they would integrate - into one of the most culturally-informed societies in the world.
Some of the readers, after reading this book, became admirers of the author's latest work, "Why the French do not like headscarves" (2006), this elegant and debated study on controversial issues that have been dividing and employing the country for 15 years and whose impacts are felt over the years.
Mr. Bowen's last book has a wider and much more ambitious scope.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media have said about Islam in France, but what really happened at the bottom.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes now caring for 5 to 6 million French Muslims, which Mr Bowen calls the “Islamic premises.”
He is a good listener, reproducing debates between teachers and students about the issues that concern them the most.
Should a Muslim enter a marriage union in a mosque or in a town hall (or in both places)?
Should a young Muslim be taught about the development and rights of gays?
Can a Muslim marry a man who is not a Muslim?
Do Muslims have the right to use an interest-based banking system if they want to get a mortgage?
These are the seemingly worldly controversial issues that are being discussed, and which are part of everyday life rather than the political dramas that the media employs.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, among other well-known figures, not excluding Tarik Ramadan, an Arab, a Muslim scholar and academic, born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up a discussion about how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They have no arguments for all their customs.
Conservatives are distrustful of the real idea of French or European Islam.
The philosophers and activists with whom Mr. Bowen interviewed bow to the supremacy that this is the antipode of Selafi — supporters of the purist Sunni Islam, grouped in Saudi Arabia — this group is small, but it influences European Muslims.
Mr. Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But adaptation requires compromises on both sides.
It raises the question of how far French politicians (and the intellectual elite that so resolutely defends the secular public) are really committed to the idea of pluralism.
It is believed that Muslims probably have less experience in matters of faith than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who also had to make historic compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than the development of pragmatism, he found "the tightening of the screws of values".
Can a Muslim be a Frenchman? After reading this book, someone may be inclined to say "Yes, but not now."
The world's most hopeless prospects
The Arctic is changing more rapidly than the rest of the planet’s environment.
Limiting ice melts at alarming speeds, affecting animals and their survival like nowhere else.
The interests of oil, gas and fisheries companies must be focused on new natural sources of water, together with diplomats, lawyers and writers when they awaken.
In "On the Thin Ice" Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, portrays the natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bear.
Well-acquainted with the complicated history and practices of whaling, it describes a long tradition of polar explorers trying to capture the white bear.
Meeting Admiral Nelson with a courageous 14-year-old swimmer who fought only with a musketeer is indeed a myth, but everything else is true.
The young bears, who swam behind the bodies of their newly killed mothers, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, 75 polar bears performed at once in a circus tent.
Even today, fences in the zoo typically have an area one million times smaller than the area available to adults in the wild. The climate is rarely appropriate: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the hollow hairs of its coat.

Mr. Ellis draws on the works of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters threaten the survival of species.
Although hunting is banned in Norway, America, and Russia, killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where they hunt from helicopters and Indians on skis and all are armed with powerful attack towels to shoot their prey.
The irony is that it takes place in the water north of these two hunting nations and that the ice will eventually be the largest.
In his new book, “After the Ice,” Alun Anderson, former editor of the New Scientist, offers a clear and unsatisfied accountability of science for the Arctic and a compelling glimpse of how the future can change it.
Scientists don’t have the answers to everything.
Even meteorologists and oceanographers do not have an adequate response to the rate of change.
That's for the lack of tests.
Fridtjof Nansen’s research trips in the late 19th and early 20th centuries first suggested how the movement of floating ice occurs.
The Cold War submarines then mapped the shifting divisions as they floated.
Satellite exploration and the vast field of probes in floating glaciers are a useful addition, but many are still being done thanks to the innocuous individuals camping in the winter.
Mr. Anderson looks into the extraordinarily fragile world of the decay system inside the Arctic ice, created by the flow of salt water that shrinks when it freezes.
But from the above-mentioned bear to microscopic wonders, all of this is doomed to extinction as soon as the summer ice moves, which takes place sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... this could be us'
6,000 Marines laid wreaths on Arlington graves
Lieutenant De'Angelo Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to lay a simple wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made their way from Johnson Camp in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, it was a day on which they paid homage to the men and women who once wore the same shoes.
“In a few months, when we land, it could be us,” Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If it happens to us, I would like someone to do the same for me to show me the respect that I am trying to do.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered that Saturday morning to lay wreaths at the Veterans Cemetery in several wards during a memorial service in Arlington.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester Funeral Society in Harrington, Maine, began this tradition when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred graves during a funeral in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition for Mr. nMorill and his wife Karen to undertake this journey each year and stop in various cities along the way to honor the memory of military members and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesterians are not looking for profit in this, wreaths across America, which they also lay in other states.
This year, volunteers laid more than 16,000 wreaths at Arlington Cemetery, within the Pentagon, at the graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, at Battery Park in New York City, and at Flight 93 United Airlines Memorial Site in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation has committed more than $150,000 to the purchase and transportation of wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she made her way to Arlington in honor of her late husband, a member of the armed forces.
Because her husband is not buried in Arlington, Mrs. Hunt said it was her way to return what the victim is doing.
It is a small way for citizens to support our units, she said.
It's kind of like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in jackets of warm fabric, volunteers walked through the cemetery on the surrounding lawns and hills.
Volunteers headed to the older tombs from World War I and World War II and the Vietnam War because these are not visited as often as newer tombs.
The mood was positive when the children played and held hands together as they transported the young pine trees to the gray tombstones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red arc bee's upper part.
Near the 60th Division, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, there was a real silence.
The United Service Organizations dedicated 1,000 wreaths to the decoration of the department, but the gloomy mood of the ongoing wars filled this area.
Some were sincerely crying, others were praying, and families and friends were holding each other in the cold air.
Some read aloud names engraved in stones, while others bowed to look at small black and white denominations pressed into wet mud where the tombstones had not yet been placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who wiped tears from her eyes in front of her son's grave.
She traveled eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the last resting place of Army Artillery Sergeant David Shane Spicer, who fell in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free. . . my son paid for it, she said.
"Even though I've been away a long time, I want to be the one to remember him."
U.S. Government Contractor Imprisoned by Cuban Government Officials
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who imported mobile phones and laptops into the country, foreign ministry officials said on Saturday.
The supplier, which has not yet been identified, worked for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials, along with the U.S. Interest Section in Havana, sought access to the detainee, who was detained on December 5.
Certain charges have not been made public, but under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreigner can be imprisoned for almost anything that is labeled "dangerous."
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical states, raise the risk of imprisonment.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
There is a young blogging community in Cuba, led by popular commentator Yoani Sanchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are being watched and harassed by government agents.
Mrs S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country in order to take over the prizes, but her permission was denied.
The detention of a U.S. contractor may be the result of growing tensions between Castro's communist brother, ruling Cuba, and the Obama administration, which has been viewed as a "retention tactic" in improving relations with the island.
They were the first to report on the arrest of the New York Times on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy emphasized that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more room for opposition, the United States will take reciprocal action.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and sought after commodities in a country where the average salary of a civil servant is $15 a month.
The Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones just this year; these are mostly used after texting because a 15-minute phone call would cost more than one daily wage.
The use of the Internet on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors and at some government junctions, such as universities.
Cubans who often want to sign up have to announce their names to the government.
Access to many websites is prohibited.
Detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
The majority of U.S. citizens in Cuba’s prison are behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berben, a press officer for the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Mrs. Berben said she couldn't provide more information about the prison.
Incarceration and detention were clearly immoral.
Such activities, which would be legal in any other open society - let's say free mobile phones - are a criminal offence in Cuba, said Miguel Vivanco, director of the American Human Rights Watch group, which recently published an unfavorable report on the freedoms of the country in Cuba, called "The New Castro in Cuba as a Tate."
Vivanco said the defendants are often arrested, tried and imprisoned in one day.
He said that all solutions would be more political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries are heading for a broader dialogue.
Pakistani government officials have uncovered a conspiracy to send men to Afghanistan.
Pakistani authorities on Saturday uncovered a purported leader of a conspiracy to send five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops there, saying they hope the case could help uncover a wide-ranging network of internet traffickers and terrorists.
Investigators said they were looking for a gray insurgent known as the Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after first spotting them when one of these men posted a comment approving the terrorist attacks on my YouTube video site.
Saifillah took the lead of these men once they arrived in Pakistan, trying to help them get to a remote area of Pakistan in the Pakistani indigenous tribes zone, which is home to al-Qaida and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who reported on the case said on Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convict al-Qaeda commanders and that the men were not part of the CIA's attempt to infiltrate a terrorist network.
As a result, they were deported for a few days to the eastern district of Sarghoda, far from the horrific mountains in the northwest, which became a haven for terrorists.
They were considered to be a strike unit.
Why they were dropped, said an official who spoke of maintaining anonymity due to the sensitivity of the case.
The official said the men were not intimidated and were still trying to obtain permission to gain access to al-Qaida camps when they were arrested under Pakistani law.
The case of this five — which remained in Pakistan and was interrogated by the FBI — highlights the critical role recruiters play in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, much more importantly, identifying who is trustworthy.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, the U.S. intelligence service has placed the highest priority on attempts to place human resources in al-Qaida.
The recruits of the organization act as guards, disqualifying those who are not serious enough in their commitment to the Holy War and those who might be scouts.
U.S. false recruits have been subjected to a special investigation at al-Qaeda, analysts said.
But they were also considered extraordinarily interesting in the group because of their potential approach to American goals and their promotional value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst at the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said terrorist groups have also become considerably more cautious in recent years about who will allow them to join, as U.S. intelligence agencies have recruited experts on their recruitment methods.
If we are trying to penetrate these groups, is there no better way than to follow their recruitment model, which has already been followed so much? said Mr Kohlmann.
This model is one that is much more web-based.
Tens of Thousands Protest in Copenhagen, Call for Climate Action
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets Saturday demanding stronger climate action from negotiators at the Bella City Convention Center.
Protesters reported the number of many hundreds of thousands of participants in the event, but police said the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively quiet and a handful of masked activists laid several small loads near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On the day of the small UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked around the city carrying banners with the English words "This is not Planet B" (i.e. second-order) and one in Spanish saying "The Earth says 'enough'."
The protest was attended by several celebrities, including the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that she traveled to her mother’s home in Peru and provided me with information about the inconsolable state of the country, which is involved in the impact of climate change, which is still happening.
That's partly why we decided to join this great march -- to go around the world and appeal to the world's leading personalities to present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement," she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done, it cannot still be avoided.
Police prevented protesters from approaching the Bella Center and said they had detained 19 people, primarily because they had either masks on or pocket knives on them.
These activities are prohibited under Danish law during demonstrations.
According to one non-participating spectator, who does not want to be identified because he is involved in climate talks, activists disguised as athletes and dressed in black clothes laid several loads near the main canal of Copenhagen, which is located near several ministries.
They were agitating at the buildings, he said, starting with lights, but then there were "several big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around the television screens to watch the march during the afternoon.
But the protest probably didn’t come to the attention of key officials, such as Su Weie, China’s top climate negotiator.
When asked if the demonstration had a constructive impact on international negotiations, he replied in English, "Actually, that is something that I was not aware of" (it's actually something I don't realize).
Then he continued in Chinese and said, "Because the venue is extensive, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He looked to see if the march was painful or helpful, depending on everyone’s prospects.
The concentration of the general public and various sectors and the subject of climate change is visible, he said.
In other words: "It can also be said that it is a violation of the conduct or freedom of other persons.
The results of the test revealed persistent racial differences.
Last week’s federal certificate of proficiency in mathematics was a welcome element of the good news about public education in Columbia County.
Although the district lags far behind the country’s high-performance systems, the certificate has shown greater progress in fourth and eighth graders over the past two years than in cities including Atlanta, Chicago, and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the latest figures of the National Attestation Center for Teaching Progress are the persistent differences in knowledge achieved between African-Americans and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average score of white fourth graders in Columbia County over the past two years has risen from 267 to 270 points (out of a possible 500), but their African-American peers only grew by three points, from 209 to 212.
The knowledge gap actually increased from 53 to 57 points between 2007 and 2009.
Progress among African-Americans in the eighth grade remains essentially balanced, with the deviation by a statistically insignificant one point from 245 to 245.
The average result in white pupils was not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture in the six-year horizon is not exactly encouraging.
The difference between white and black fourth graders in 2003, when the first NAEP was performed in the district, was 60 points on the scale (262 to 202).
Although the result achieved in children from both groups improved during this period, the difference barely approached 58.
Some education advocates in the district said last week that the results, celebrated by Secretary Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D), were more extensively stimulated in white students where the results were already high.
That would indicate that we have increased the amount of support from those at the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and troubling, said Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates for equality of education in the district.
I’m not jumping up and down because of the scattering of two or three points,” said committee member D.C. Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of Eaton Elementary School.
Frequently criticizing Mrs. Rhee’s style of administration, Mrs. Brown said that reporting test results means high school in the city is in a desperate state and requires attention.
Obviously, you always want to see the pros and I respect that.
But what’s scary is that we didn’t devote almost any time and energy that needed to be devoted to our high school.
Ms. Rhee said the district's effort is to continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-achieving students.
Thus, for example, some teachers are trained in the use of new reading curriculums, Wilson’s reading system, aimed at high school students and high school students who have failed to master the basics of reading before in their peer careers lag significantly behind their peers.
The day-to-day mathematics and sixth-grade math curriculum, highlighting the games and real-life experiences that got into the district under former director Clifford Janey, can be attributed to the NAEP progress reported last week.
And I think that we should continue to work and make the best possible interventions for those students who remain below the class level, said Mrs. Rhee.
Others said that the NAEP results clarified the question of whether Mrs Rhee could continue to improve the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for low-performing schools, which is necessary to reduce the gap.
It’s a certain precarious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of teaching at the University of California, Berkeley, where he studies test results in urban areas.
The conventional remedy procedure is to focus resources and administrative reforms on schools, located in the worst parts of the District of Columbia.
Thus, the focus can bring political resonances that are directed against an important agenda.
But the highlight also belongs to other city directors, who are trying to maintain a medium ratio between whites and blacks.
We need to focus on building a system of big schools.
We must strengthen the kinship of our schools so that all families, no matter where they live, can rely on their children to be given excellent public education.
Mr. Janey, now the school principal in Newark, said in an interview this week that a key element in reducing the gap between the results achieved is an extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the district, to make the schools eligible.
You need to get up to 200 days to enforce the changes, said Mr. Janey, who signed a contract with his teachers’ association last year for a 185-day school year, which he considers a “sign” of looking for a bigger raise next year.
Making Higher Education Part of a Better Future
The bus drove into the Gettysburg Railroad with a loud breath.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, stepped out and rested for a moment on white columns, brick facades and emerald green lawns.
Graciela’s parents had difficulty graduating from a college in El Salvador.
Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, has never entered the track.
Now she and other eighth graders in the group were exploring Gettysburg, where tuition was $38690 a year, their position being rather intimidated by visitors enthusiastic about potential students.
Yes, that's it! called Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide offered them to enter the building of knowledge.
“Wow, really?” she said thoughtfully when they told them the low ratio of professors to students.
Pennsylvania College was one of seven that they visited on their three-day tour and were now completely fascinated by the future news: The question is not whether you will enter the college.
The question is from where.
However, this is a major problem related to the high number of U.S.-born children of Spanish immigrants who are excluded from colleges or pregnant as minors, but there are hundreds of thousands of those who receive secondary education and thus enter the middle class.
In fact, one-fifth of this "second generation" of Spanish college students - remarkable results achieved - indicate that many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexicans and Central American residents, arrived in the United States without completing college.
Their success story is important, the researchers say, as it underscores their point of the way forward for a generation that has played a marginal role in the country’s workforce.
Those who have achieved higher education say they have had a natural inclination to school and an innate permeability and striving to succeed.
Many also had parents who set high goals for their children and were looking for ways to replace ignorance of American education.
But school programs also play an extraordinary role in helping Graciela and the millions of children who would like to attend college — especially if those efforts persist over time.
If we take into account that children come from low-income groups whose parents have no experience and the ability to help them navigate the system, any simple intervention at every single point won’t solve it, says Patricia Gandara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis.
We need to think about providing these preschoolers with a catch-network in all ways to get them through college.
The federal program that funded Graciela’s rail trip is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to run track preparatory programs, starting for students from low-income groups in high schools and continuing until these students graduate from college.
Since 1999, the program has served more than 10 million students, of whom more than 1% have entered colleges, according to data from the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraq's Ministry of Oil Industry has reached an agreement with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite fears of violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to get major oil companies to rebuild their non-stop infrastructure during two auctions held on Saturday.
Ten agreements have been signed by Iraq’s Ministry of Oil Industry with foreign oil companies, suggesting that Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are ready to play a significant role in rebuilding Iraq’s oil industry, weakened by decades of wars and sanctions.
U.S. companies have gone to two of the ten auctioned fields with capital participation.
Seven U.S. companies paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
Only one of them made a lost offer.
The two U.S. companies reached an agreement on the field, which was auctioned in June.
U.S. oil giants’ participation in Iraq’s open oil industry has surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war and instead of American companies, you have here in the first place on the way of Asians and Europeans, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, online news.
This will be long before anything else is for sale in Iraq.
Security concerns, underscored by Tuesday’s massive coordinated bombings and political instability, as well as the U.S. military’s withdrawal, are likely to discourage U.S. companies from doing much more intensive business in Iraq, which has demonstrably the third-largest raw material reserves, analysts say.
U.S. companies have been disadvantaged in some cases, especially Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies have significantly lower operating costs and are more prone to risk because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to enter into agreements with the ministry.
Leading U.S. companies such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained close contacts with Iraq’s oil ministry and offered technical assistance in recent years, have left empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the top shareholders in two of the contracts awarded at the end of this week.
China’s state-owned National Petroleum Corp. participated in bids on more contracts than all other companies and left with large stakes in contracts on two major fields.
“We all know that China is striving to become a major economic, as well as a technological force,” oil ministry spokesman Assam Jihad said.
We are convinced that the Chinese company will be comparable to the competition and will live up to its commitments to Iraq.
Companies that were pre-selected to submit bids, which were then compared by the Ministry according to the price per barrel and the Ministry is willing to pay for strengthening output above the current level in each field.
Al-Qaida’s top planner was reportedly killed in Pakistan.
A U.S. missile strike on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border this week appears to have killed a top al-Qaida operations planner, U.S. counterterrorism officials said on Friday.
As confirmed, this could be the second deadly attack on one of the top terrorist leaders.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs killed when several rockets hit their car on Thursday near the town of Miran Sah in North Waziristan province, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the area.
Local authorities said the missiles were fired from an unmanned aircraft of the type used by the CIA in the illegal native tribes.
These were listed on a white car heading for the Afghan border when it was hit, the official said, along with Pakistan’s Cicil Intelligence Agency, who was calling from Miran Shah.
The official said the local gunmen clung to the spot and quickly seized what was left of the "totally destroyed bodies".
Local authorities were unable to verify the identity of the victims, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials cited an unspecified witness who said Somalia was post-death.
Somalia has been cited as a high-ranking al-Qaida military operations planner who led operations by terrorist groups outside Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in reconnaissance around the world, said a senior official who did not want to be named, who cited the sensitive nature of U.S. air strikes on Pakistani territory.
If he held such a central position, he was probably involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He was instructed by al-Qaida’s top leadership to plan possible terrorist attacks.
Another U.S. official said Somalia was rapidly advancing in the al-Qaida hierarchy and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not have been a well-known figure to some Americans, but he had not humiliated himself in any way to pose before us and our allies, another official said.
When his death was confirmed, Somalis should be the second high-ranking leader of al-Qaida or the Taliban to be killed since September when Najmudin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the indigenous tribes and three other top pro-democracy leaders were killed in a similar attack.
The rate of attacks launched by the CIA using drones has decreased since summer from an average of about six operations per month to two, according to records from the Long War diary, a website run by a nonprofit group.
The reduction may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability by mercilessly killing people they suspected were informants, the site said.
The United Nations High Representative in Kabul has resigned.
The U.N.’s top delegate to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday he would like to step down from his post in March, ending a turbulent tenure that has been marred by allegations of widespread corruption in Afghanistan’s U.N.-backed presidential election.
Eid's departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send another 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. delegate said he supported the increase, but expressed concern that the U.S. timetable for reducing the situation, which begins in 18 months, should be a challenge for governments of other NATO states to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the build-up of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans that they should have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment made must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat has also pushed the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian employees helping in Afghanistan’s political transformation.
The increase on the side of the armed forces must be copied on the side of civilians, he said.
Eide said he would not resign, but simply fulfill the promise he made to his family in March 2008 that he would only spend two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to report to the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he would need time to find a replacement.
“As I said, it’s time to look for a successor,” Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month gap between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has begun seeking compensation.
Officials said the decision was made between Staffan di Mistura, who is of Swedish-Italian descent and previously led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenn, a Frenchman who previously led UN peacekeeping operations.
Eid’s position in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, was accused in September by President Hamid Karzai of winning the country’s presidential election by masking the presence of massive electoral machinations.
Eide denied these claims, but said Galgraith's accusations -- which he was released from -- "definitely damaged the mission because there was a high degree of skepticism with regard to international interference" in the election.
Eide said he had proposed a meeting with the U.S. High Representative to coordinate relief efforts with the U.S. leadership in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow his successors to hire more workers from the United States and other Western countries to lend them to the Afghan mission, which he said would strengthen their confidence that their money is being spent properly.
Eide expressed disappointment at the limitation of his efforts in Afghanistan, saying that difficult UN recruitment regulations undermined its ability to use its capabilities.
The UN rules are such that I have had the opportunity to get only one person since May, he said.
It's a disaster and I can't go on.
Gates: Iran faces further sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that world powers would soon impose "further significant sanctions" on Iran because of a lack of engagement in talks over its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a week-long journey through the war-torn areas of Afghanistan and Iraq, downplayed the prospects of armed action against the Islamic Republic.
This is not a good choice for Iran, he said in response to a soldier’s question about probable developments.
One of the things that depends on me is whether I learned about something from Iraq in the last six years, [that] is inseparable unpredictability in the war.
The Obama administration is deciding on a package of sanctions that could affect Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates signaled that some of these sanctions could also affect ordinary Iranians.
He said a "package of incentives and restraints" would require "to make the Iranian government really feel less safe with nuclear weapons" because "its people will be extraordinarily suffering" from sanctions.
According to a statement released Friday by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration has involved European leaders in warning that Iran will suffer serious consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program into full compliance with the U.N. Nuclear Security Committee and its oversight body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop its expertise only for peaceful purposes.
During the talks in Geneva on October 1, he indicated that he wanted to return to talks on limiting his nuclear program and agreed to provide a substantial part of his supplies of enriched uranium in exchange for the urgently needed fuel for the reactor to carry out medical research.
The administration set out such an agreement as a way to build trust between the two parties and to make time for negotiations.
But since then, it seems, Iran has withdrawn from the interim agreements - partly because of this, the expert says, because the Iranian leadership is divided in opinions on whether to engage with the United States.
To be honest, as far as Iran's stubbornness towards the international community is concerned, in the case of some of the proposals that he actually agreed to in early October, I think it has led the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, together on a path that does not tell the terminology of additional sanctions.
President Obama set a deadline for Iran to respond to proposals before returning to seek other elections, including monitoring, which Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “degrading sanctions.”
In a statement issued in New York, the Iranian mission to the United Nations on Thursday condemned what it called "unfounded and unfounded accusations" before some members of the Security Committee on Iran's nuclear activities and said it wanted to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before leaving for the oil-rich Kurdistan region to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
There is still high tension between the Kurds and the Iraqi Arab majority, mainly due to borders, property rights and income distribution.
Gtes urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict to avoid delaying U.S. plans to limit the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
US officials quoted Gates as saying to Massoud Barzaani, the president of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in a unified Iraq.
We don't want to leave you."
In aging China, changing course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters reading that "Mother Earth is too exhausted to feed more children" and "One extra child means one extra grave".
Then they got the lesson that when official government posts in Shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rate and aging population in their city, suddenly changed course this summer and began encouraging young couples, their reaction was immediate and determined: Never.
We have always devoted all our time and energy to just one child.
We didn’t leave anything for others, says Wang, 31, a human resources manager who has an 8-month-old son.
China’s more than 30-year-old policy of having only one child has been implemented, creating two generations of only notoriously chubby and spoiled children, affectionately dubbed “little emperors,” threatening the country’s population crisis.
The average birth rate fell to 1.8 babies per pair compared to six before the policy went into effect, according to UN data.
The distribution of the population, where the number of inhabitants aged 60 years and above is predicted to grow turbulently from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. This is well above the overall average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is greater than the rich coastal cities with populations with higher education, for example in Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for almost 22 percent of Shanghai’s registered population, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai City Commission on Population and Family Planning, said many couples must have children to “help reduce the proportion of the aging population and reduce the number of workers in the future.”
He says it's about "being old, it doesn't mean being rich -- like in developed countries like Japan or Sweden."
Gradual reassurance
As enshrined in the country’s constitution in 1978, China’s one-child policy is arguably the most controversial mandate ever established under the Communist Party’s rule.
Couples who violated politics faced huge fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some areas -- and discrimination at work.
China’s official sites have advocated policies that have helped the country prevent critical exploitation of natural resources, while human rights defenders have been condemned for advocating policies.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women to undergo abortions with their second child.
In addition, many couples had to undergo sexist-selective abortions, leading to an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, population officials have been gradually milder in their stance on one-child policy.
In 2004, they generally allowed exceptions — including city residents, members of national minorities, and cases where men and women were single — and in 2007, they mitigated the diction of their hard-line passwords.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at Beijing University’s Population Research Institute, said central government officials had previously debated more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners was an only child.
In June, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost overnight, the posters, urging parents to have only one child, were replaced by copies of the ordinance detailing how it would be permissible to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples in their homes and insert leaflets under the door.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial advice to those who chose to have more than one child.
The reaction was cold, family planning officials said.
Sorrowful response
Although officials in a rural town near Shanghai have seen an increase in interest in couples who would like to have a second child after the campaign starts, most city districts have not reported any changes.
The city district of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, still recorded four to five cases per month.
Disappointed officials in Shanghai said despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only around 165,000 - slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in Shanghai’s Caolu district, said financial considerations were probably the main reason people didn’t want to have more children.
They want to give the best to the first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said she would like to have two children and they were legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese, who only have insufficient health and life insurance, provided by the government.
Without a doctrinal intercept network, the choice could be irresponsible.
People in the West misjudged one-child policy as a controversial legal issue, says Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is in the seventh month of pregnancy in a union with the first child.
Yes, we were deprived of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not only in politics.
It's about money.
Other couples report psychological reasons for hesitation.
Wang, the human resources manager, says they only want one child because she was also an only child: "We were the focus of our families and everyone took care of us.
We weren’t used to providing care and in fact we didn’t want to take care of the other.
Chen Zijian, 42, who runs a translation company, put it much more bluntly.
For middle-class dual-career parents who have reduced fertility, he said, being successful means being selfish.
Today’s 20- and 30-year-olds view their parents as the first days of China’s experiment with capitalism and don’t want this way of living for themselves, he says.
One child puts enormous demands on parents’ time, he says.
A mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the controversial questions of the aisle -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and the strategy -- "You have to have resumes prepared at a time when the child is 9 months old for good preschool education.
Most of his friends want to settle for one child, Che says, but not two.
We are the first generation with higher food standards, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The UN group has outlined a plan to reduce emissions.
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterized by far-reaching uninformed attitudes and mutual scrutiny -- again focused on releasing a document on Friday that proposes ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years with industrialized nations bearing the brunt of the most burden.
The text, which can provide a starting point for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, highlights the remaining obstacles as well as illuminates the way forward.
But there was significant progress in the negotiations that took place at the wrong time with more than 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Created by the UN ad hoc working group, this text unobtrusively states how much money rich countries should provide to the poor to deal with global warming in the short and long term.
And it provides a full range of choices for key issues, including how to develop and manage emerging economies to limit their carbon outputs, and what should be the upper limit of global temperature rise that political actors will still be able to tolerate.
This will provide the process with a great deal of flexibility, says John Coequyt, chief executive officer of the Sierra Washington club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who proposed a six-page document, shortened the 180-page text from the talks to focus on what top UN climate official Yvo de Boer described as a "big picture".
It outlines the possible agreement in which industrial nations could collectively limit their emissions to 25 to 45 percent by the year compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries could reduce their emissions to 15 to 30 percent during that period.
Together, the country would reduce emissions by between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union swiftly negotiated on Friday a pledge to provide $3.6 trillion over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to climate change -- from managing floods and droughts to preventing deforestation.
But he still said the same kind of verbal fireworks that prevailed in talks last week.
U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Affairs Todd Stern rejected a speech calling for binding greenhouse gas emission reductions for industrialized countries compared to volunteering with major emerging economies if they were not funded by the developed world.
The move signaled that the Obama administration had set a harder line against China by officials of the Bush administration just two years ago.
The United States will not accede to the treaty without the transfer of major developing countries and the implementation of actions, Stern said, who also lamented that the text was not enough to secure the restrictions and should be checked by external observers.
Stern made this comment an hour after China's Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei told the U.S. climate chief negotiator that either a lack of "rural reason" or "extraordinary irresponsibility" could lead to a statement earlier in the week that the U.S. could not help financially.
With the future of the economic path of the major world powers at stake, tensions have erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current struggle is mostly for the preservation of individual economies rather than for the preservation of the planet, between China and the United States for the fulfilment of their respective obligations, while the poorer nations point out that the two dozen most influential countries in the world ignore the scientific imperative to carry out more forceful actions.
Ricardo Ulate, Costa Rica’s delegate, said it’s not surprising that major powers are fighting over who should bear the costs of limiting greenhouse gases, while vulnerable countries have become much more aggressive in finding ways to stop major emitters responsibly in their actions.
It is clearly a game about the new economic hegemony developing, said Ulate, who also serves as a regional adviser on regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international conservation.
Some of the countries that are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change have suggested they would like to continue to push for a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, but most of the main participants have said that the best outcome of the talks will be a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, created a 24-page draft agreement last Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who led the international climate negotiations in favour of the European Commission, said the push by small island nations "triggered political pressure on the whole polar process" partly because they are now unified and demanding action from growing economies such as China and India.
Negotiations triggered a new urgency once delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the remaining disputed issues before the heads of government contested the deal.
High-ranking officials such as India’s environment minister Jairam Rame<0xC5><0x9F> and China’s deputy minister stepped out of the planes and walked through the halls of the Bella Centre to closed door meetings and new conferences so they could outline the demands that will be assessed next week.
The sheer scale of the gathering—when 13,000 people moved to and from the convention center every day, guitar-playing activists staged an ironic look at the countries they thought they had sent out at night, and there was no e-mailing of proposals from hand to hand.
The intensity is only a superstructure: almost all the key ministers were present in Copenhagen and earlier in the middle 60 heads of state.
We got into high categories, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, said the Deputy Minister of Global Policy for International Conservation.
Heavy weights are coming.
The first British train with a speed of 140 miles per hour redefined this Monday feelings
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, the whistle cut through the darkness to mark the departure of the train, which marked the transport revolution in Britain.
The country’s first high-speed passenger train will reach a speed of 140 miles per hour and fly from Ashford, Kent to London’s St Pancras, surpassing a distance of 58 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, then joined Mrs. Kelly Holmes and entered the first high-speed personal kit outside of London.
It hopes that the new service will eventually connect Britain with an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the large agglomerations of Midland, the North and Scotland to London.
Neglected standing water should shorten transport times in passenger transport and on business trips, and the transition from aircraft and cars to rail could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate congestion on roads.
Theoretically, the three main political parties were won for this vision.
But the tens of trillions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable struggle for projects, and concerns about environmental disruption have now slowed down the construction of Britain’s high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the government with a workable study, delivered its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, the Times reported.
She gave him a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed network.
The new route between London and West Midland was designed within five metres in urban areas and neighborhoods where touching the habitat could be problematic.
In the open landscape, the final route was planned up to 25 m.
The HS2 also envisages identifying three options for an extensive high-speed network leading north.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
The preferred option is the confication of the shape of the letter Y, where one high-speed track should lead to the western Midland.
The track should be split near Birmingham with one branch passing from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and the other leading northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle over Tyne.
One route should lead to Scotland.
"It looks like the most powerful choice has been made," said a railway expert.
As soon as this is done, the journey time between London and Edinburgh will be shortened to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which will not open before 2025, could allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared to more than one hour in the presence.
The proposals would allow trains to travel at a speed of 2250 miles per hour, making the UK network the fastest in Europe.
The initial route is already being designed to take 400 m long trains that would be able to transport 1100 people.
Up to 18 sets could operate every hour on the London-Birmingham route.
This means that the London terminal would be able to serve up to 20,000 passengers per hour if needed.
Given the capital constraints, it is assumed that the existing station would expand to accommodate the high-speed network.
Rail industry experts claim that only San Pancras International or Euston offer such a potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he intends to implement this scheme, but extensive public consultations and planning procedures mean that no final decision will be made before the general election.
Even if he puts the wheels in motion, the network should be built in parts.
Trains should first be put into service not on high-speed routes, but on already existing routes north of Birmingham and maintain travel times between London and Scotland over three hours.
This is considered to be a crucial point of contact to ensure the transition from aircraft to trains, a point of reference for the revolution on the railway.
Taxpayers have paid a <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 mortgage on the Tory Orangery
Alan Duncan, the Tory front bench holder in the House of Representatives, was paid by taxpayers thousands of pounds last year for an orangery he built in his constituency home.
A spokesman for the party behind the prison, which was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs were living "on assignments", raised his mortgage to <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 to build an oak-covered extension in his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge special interest, a total of hundreds of pounds per month to taxpayers.
The municipal authorities approved the claims in time, so Sir Thomasen Legg, who was carrying out the control of the member spenders, was not questioned. Last night Mr Duncan made his claims "it could have been cleaner or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest members of parliament, owns two two-storey country houses in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Houses are worth about <0xC2><0xA3>1 million.
There's a kitchen, a living room and a dining room on the ground floor, but the finance office agreed that Mr. Duncan needs more space.
Last year, he added a winter garden to the house, which is marked in the plans as "orangery".
Neighbors describe it as a "greenhouse for entertainment and hospitality".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to provide any explanation for the increased loan during the last review by the Municipal Standards and Privileges Committee in the last mortgage settlement.
The committee told him last month that he had broken the rules after reviewing his spending.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the pupil security to a mortgage of <0xC2><0xA3>27,1406 from his property in London to a house in his constituency, which he bought in 1991, a year before becoming a member of the House of Commons.
Documents released this week showed that Mr. Duncan was claiming approximately <0xC2><0xA3>1,400 a month in the interest of a mortgage until March of last year.
In April, his claims increased to more than 1,800 pounds per month.
The interest in repayment of Mr Duncan’s RBS mortgage could not have changed at this time, suggesting that all this was intended to finance a <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 loan.
The standard RBS variable of mortgage repayment fell in December 2007 from 7.94 percent to 4 percent in March this year, while it remained.
The latest municipal document shows that Mr. Duncan continued to claim <0xC2><0xA3>1,250 per month this May.
Mr. Duncan left his job as shadow director of the House in September after being filmed by a secret news reporter and said MPs must survive "on the sidelines" of a spending scandal.
"Basically it's nationalized, you have to live on the allocation and treat you like a s**t."
He said, "I spent money on my garden and my entitlement and a small fraction of what was needed.
And I could claim all that damn share, but I won't."
The MP, a millionaire from a former career as an oil trader, was first asked to explain his releases in May, when it turned out that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden, even before approval by the finance office that "it could be considered excessive."
One of the activists dug a pit in the shape of a pound in Mr Duncan's lawn to protest after it was revealed that he had claimed 4,000 pounds for three years.
When asked about the mortgage increase last night, Mr. Duncan said, "It was because of the capital increase, which was approved by both the Treasury and subsequently by Legg."
He added: "It's not a question of hiding and tickling or violating the rules or anything else.
It's absolutely a straight line down, by the rules, justified and that's it.
It could not be in many other ways cleaner or simpler.”
Come and take a closer look at the cottage on the Brighton coast with the advent calendar.
Coastal cottages in Brighton have found a new meaning to life in the winter months as an interactive advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative ecclesiastical group that encourages ducal creativity, called on 24 owners to decorate their cottages for every day in December, and to use Christmas wheels as a theme of this decoration.
The event began on 1 December, when visitors were able to view the last chat from 5.30pm to 6.30pm each day, and the bishop’s bread and wine were provided free of charge.
Selected carols included I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël, where the cottage featured the work of Janet Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, a 50-year-old television marketing assistant from Hove, is a non-stipendiary priest in the Diocese of Chichester and head of Beyond.
He said: "We want to make religion much more important for people in post-Christian society.
"As a church, why should we expect people to come to strangers' old buildings? I feel that the church should come to people and serve in an awakening way.
"The idea of an advent calendar in the cottages came from a conversation with some friends during dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and vibrant place and we’ve tried to try and present it spiritually.”
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world against climate change.
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday to demand a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming to be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, demonstrators around the world and in Copenhagen, where police arrested hundreds of people on the occasion.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources and 100,000 according to organizers, demonstrated in cold weather in the Danish capital on the occasion of a UN climate conference aimed at adopting an agreement that could enter into force on Friday 1 January 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the climate conference, said that the growing global mobilization, which is clearly evidenced by the current demonstrations, had contributed to the fact that the "political tax" of possible failure in Copenhagen would be too high.
According to AFP, there were incidents in the Danish capital shortly after the parade began, when a group of about 300 protesters, dressed in black, began smashing up the stalls with paving stones and hammers.
The police immediately took a heavy hit.
In total, the police announced the arrests of 600 to 700 people and specified that they were mainly members of the "Blacks Blocks", ultra-radical independent groups that had already manifested themselves at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action Coalition (CJA), one of the organizers of the event, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals were arrested "without distinction" and stressed that about a hundred of them were in shackles and in a seat "held on the streets on Saturday evening" despite the extreme violence.
After leaving Parliament, the parade proceeded calmly towards the Bella Center, where negotiations were taking place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to penetrate the inside.
A podium was erected for the speakers, in front of which a spiritual meeting took place at candlelight with the participation of the former South African archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from major European cities, and in addition to Africans, there were a large number of participants from Asia, including several Chinese and Koreans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly dressed in blue robes, formed the first gathering in Copenhagen in the morning at the invitation of the group Friends of the Earth, which wanted to create "blue waves" for a "fair climate".
Today we are going to the streets to demand a settlement of ecological debt in favor of the south, explained Lidy Nacpilov<0xC3><0xA1>, a Filipino fighter from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
“We can’t say any more: it’s time,” declared Benin singer Angelique Kidjo.
In Africa, rivers and streams are drying up, today we can walk in them, and it has never been possible before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement for a different world came closer to ecological organizations.
French MEP José Bové, one of the figures in the fight for another world, said he arrived in Copenhagen with the aim of "connecting climate and social justice". "Currently, there is no difference between fighting global warming and fighting for another world".
The first demonstrations began in the Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands particularly sensitive to climate warming.
About 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia, according to the organizers.
In Manila, several hundred people marched, mostly students, in red clothes and with scarves evoking the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta, but also in Canada, several hundred demonstrators took to the streets demanding strong action against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people took part in the protests organized by the "350" movement, mainly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
Dozens of people gathered in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia elects its president, Georgia denounces it as "fresh"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, about a year after Moscow recognized the pro-Russian separatist territory as independent from Georgia, Tbilisi, on the other hand, declared the move a "freak".
About 131,000 people were invited to participate in these first elections after the Russo-Georgian War in August 2008 for control of South Ossetia, another former Georgian territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 17:00 GMT.
According to officials of the Abkhaz Election Commission, participation was 58% a few hours before the closing of the polling stations.
The first preliminary results should be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
All five candidates, including incumbent President Sergei Bagapsh, categorically reject the idea of merging with Georgia, which has condemned these elections.
These choices are fracking.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili "regrets that Abkhazia has completely fallen into Russian domination," his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladze, said.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of the 216,000-strong territory, while the rest of the world considered it part of Georgia, which was illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After secession from Georgia, after the 1992-1993 conflict, in which several thousand people were killed, Abkhazia is trying to show through elections that it is ready to return to international politics.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, a new era of our independent state, said Kvar<0xC4><0x8D>ija Sv<0xC4><0x9B>tlanova, a 54-year-old historian who also admitted to voting for President Baghdad.
She was one of those who came to vote in the polls at a school in the capital of Suchumi, in a beautiful white building with several palm trees at the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is the main topic of presidential elections in this region on the Black Sea coast, which can boast of beautiful nature.
Across this small country of 216,000 people, huge billboards with Baghdad are being deployed alongside Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
In Gali, in the west of the country, Russian officials who came to oversee the successful conduct of the elections were warmly welcomed by the district mayor Beslan Arshba.
"We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful," he said at a small ceremony, referring to Moscow's support and especially its decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
"I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations," said Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, adding a glass of vodka.
The opposition, which was represented in the elections by former vice president Raul Khadzhimba and two businessmen Zaus Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticized last year's contracts with Moscow, such as a contract that allows Russia to control the Abkhazian 10th-floor railway network.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he supports neither the current government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is required to win the election.
If none of the candidates achieves this result, the decisive match must take place within two weeks.
Climate: manifestations in the world, events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday to demand a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming to be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, demonstrating around the world and in Copenhagen, where police arrested about 700 people on the occasion.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources and 100,000 according to organizers, demonstrated in the cold afternoon in the Danish capital, which hosts delegates from 193 countries until December 18, negotiating an agreement that could enter into force on January 1, 2013.
After leaving Parliament, the parade proceeded calmly towards the Bella Center, where negotiations were taking place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to penetrate the inside.
A podium was erected for the speakers, in front of which a spiritual meeting took place at candlelight with the participation of the former South African archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
According to AFP, there were incidents shortly after the parade left, when a group of several hundred demonstrators, dressed whole in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began to smash the stalls.
The police immediately surrounded them and hit them without waiting, while several demonstrators were knocked to the ground.
In total, the police announced the arrests of 600 to 700 people and specified that they were mainly members of the "Blacks Blocks", ultra-radical independent groups that had already manifested themselves at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, in April.
In the late afternoon, a police officer was injured in a paving block on his jaw and four cars were set on fire near a squat near the incidents, which led to the arrest of about 20 people, according to police sources.
We are focusing on extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, as police helicopters again flew into the air.
Most of the protesters who arrived by bus or train from major German cities, from London, Amsterdam and Milan were of European origin.
But there were also many Asians, including a few Chinese and Koreans or Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly dressed in blue robes, formed the first gathering in Copenhagen in the morning at the call of the group Friends of the Earth, which wanted to create "blue waves" for a "fair climate".
Today we are going to the streets to demand a settlement of ecological debt in favor of the south, explained Lidy Nacpilov<0xC3><0xA1>, a Filipino fighter from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

Oxfam has summoned several celebrities, including Danish model Helena Christensen and former U.N. refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, to speak to the crowd.
The first demonstrations began in the Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands particularly sensitive to climate warming.
About 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia, according to the organizers.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students in red clothes and with scarves evoking the importance of solar energy, demonstrated in front of the city hall of the capital of the Philippines.
Several hundred demonstrators also met in Hong Kong and Jakarta demanding strong action against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people took part in the protests organized by the "350" movement, mainly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).

The subjects of geography and history will be strengthened as part of the reform of the general grammar school, Chatel said.
Education Minister Luc Chatel said Sunday during an interview for JDD magazine that the subjects of history and geography will be "strengthened" as part of the reform of the general high schools, although their teaching will no longer be mandatory in the last year of the high school with a focus on exact sciences.
Now all students of the second year will have four hours a week and for all there will be the same program from the general culture, Chatel confirmed.
According to the minister, "it is necessary to end hypocrisy", because according to him, the S specialization is no longer focused on the exact sciences, but "in fact, there are the best students in it".
The EC and L specializations cannot be for S some sub-specializations, he continues, emphasizing: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who would have difficulty not learning geography and history in the last year of professional grammar schools".
A survey by Ifop, which published the newspaper Humanité on Saturday, showed that seven Frenchmen out of ten (69%) do not agree with the government's project to abolish compulsory history and geography education in the S-graduation year, which is why many intellectuals and teachers, as well as critics, have said.
The minister, on the other hand, added that "it is not considered" to cancel the philosophy in the program of specialization with the graduation year.
At the same time, Luc Chatel defended the reform in teacher education, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for participation in Tuesday's mobilization against this project, which they say sacrifices the pedagogical education of future high school professors.
As part of the master’s degree program 2 (M2), they will undergo an entrance examination focused on their field at the beginning of the year and at the end of the year a further examination verifying their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
They will participate in professional internships during the second year of the master’s degree and in the first year they will perform as professor-intern before the pupils.
If you count all the internships that will be offered to you before the admissions procedure, you will gain more experience with students, almost 300 hours, continued .
The minister also announced that he would propose a "personal right to education", which does not yet exist in national education.
He again confirmed the project to cancel the school map by 2012.
At the elite <0xC3><0x89>cole Normale Supérieure, experts have 15 minutes to convince about the climate.
Fifteen minutes to the presentation of the goals of the Copenhagen Summit: this is the call announced in the council this morning by Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Development (GIEC) at the initiative of the Ecole Normale Supérieure University on Ulm Street.
As one AFP journalist reported, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jean Jouzel opened the first of the “Ernest” conferences, which is a one-day seminar consisting of fifteen-minute expert contributions, which will be filmed and open to the public.
We wanted to do something that would attract people and on the basis of which they would have a greater desire to learn something more, explained Edouard Hannezo, 22, one of the organizers of this seminar, named after the fish from the local lake, which the students named so.
He selected about twenty contributing experts from individual scientific disciplines and specified that the selection is based on their charisma.
"We can talk for hours, but we can also sum up the basic goals in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel, who spoke to 50 listeners without pre-prepared remarks, told AFP.
It is part of our scientific work, he stressed, with the hope that the audience will recognize that "the Copenhagen conference is based on a very seriously prepared scientific foundation".
Videos recorded at these lectures will be posted on the school’s website from December 15.
The next "Ernest" seminar is scheduled for February and others will follow on a regular basis every two months.
Delays in payments: Angry supervisors in prisons, planned measures
Prison guards unions announced a "general mobilization" on Friday as they demand that they be repaid bonuses and overtimes for Christmas holidays, whose payment has been postponed to January for financial reasons.
Prison FOs (2nd supervisory unions) have asked staff who will not be on duty to attend demonstrations held in front of prison facilities on Tuesday morning to "block" them, warning of "theft of their wages".
The CGT for Prison Supervisors (3rd trade unions of this sector) has been called upon to "convene meetings in individual prisons and initiate a fundamental mobilization" with the fact that it is "shameful and unacceptable" to "overtimes and surcharges for work at night, on Sundays and on holidays" from
The first supervisory unions, the Federal Union of Prison Supervisors (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for a total mobilization (...) in order to show dissatisfaction and outrage".
The Administrative Directorate and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of overtime has increased significantly in 2009 and not all of them have been included in the financial budget, but they assure that the amounts due will be paid in January.
The Chancellery said at the end of the day that Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Mari had sent a message to the unions of prison guards, in which it assured them that the payment would be made next month.
I am aware of the efforts that prison staff are making to ensure the functioning and modernisation of our prison system, the minister writes in her statement.
I have ordered the administrative directorate of prisons to take immediate measures to ensure that the situation created by the miscalculation of overtime is never repeated in the future, added Minister Alliot-Mari.
The December salary will therefore be low, with the exception of executives who receive famous bonuses for performing the function and achieving the goals, Ufap/Unsa says, and for those "there is always room in the budget".
It is simply a scandal, the interregional FO union in Marseille has become infuriated and announced its decision to boycott the appeal "all meetings and summonses".
Workers will not come to work on Sundays or holidays unless they are repaid in December for these days of October, as well as for overtime, also threatens FO Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when we are being given more and more work and more tasks without having to provide us with additional staff, it is sad to allow the lowest-ranking employees to pay for it, according to the CGT prison guards in Bordeaux.
According to trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are better than others.
However, in any case, the funds are scarce, said Ufap Secretary-General Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Forget.
Obama Says He Gives “Better Gifts” Than He Receives at Christmas
US President Barack Obama, who is preparing for his first Christmas with his family at the White House, confided to the "goddess" of the screen Oprah Winfrey that, as far as gifts are concerned, he has a simple rule: "I give better gifts than they are the ones I get."
The president and his wife Michelle spoke in a special issue of the show, which will air Sunday night on ABC about how they are going to spend the Christmas holidays and the end of the year in their new and prestigious home.
Even Bo, a small four-legged companion of the family, gets his share.
Jesus likes Boa too, Michelle Obama said, with the dog also "of course" getting a gift, according to excerpts from the preliminary broadcast of the show.
And Michelle Obama also protested against her husband’s claim about the quality of gifts she gets: “No, I certainly didn’t, I gave you great gifts last year.”
Well, that's true, of course, he was forced to agree with the president, but immediately after that, with humor, he pointed his finger at the pearl necklace of the first lady: "And who gave you this?".
During this one-hour, very relaxed show with the famous moderator, who worked hard to support Barack Obama in his presidential campaign, the Obamas also talked about their favorite gifts they received as children.
Barack Obama introduced a wheel with a ten-speed gearbox, but also a basketball, which was given to him at Christmas by his Kenyan father, whom he met only very rarely.
“I remember seeing my father come to see us at Christmas and he gave me the basketball,” the president said.
A long time later, I realized that he was the one who gave me the ball.
The first lady once again remembered the dollhouse.
I didn’t know how to organize everything in the house, so I leveled all the furniture along the wall instead of placing it around the fireplace, but I loved that little dollhouse, Michelle Obama recalled.
Johnny Hallyday Re-Operated, RTL Says He's In Artificial Sleep
Johnny Hallyday was re-operated in Los Angeles due to "injuries" caused by a major operation he had in France, but the situation is according to his closest "under control", while the RTL station said the singer was in artificial sleep to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-operated in the night from Wednesday to Thursday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after U.S. doctors found the "injury resulting from the operation" of a sore film he had taken in Paris on November 26, the Paris press service said.
However, the singer's press department tried to calm the public, saying the situation was "under control" and also announced that new medical communications would be issued within 48 hours at the latest.
According to RTL, the lead partner of the singer’s last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put to artificial sleep to avoid “pain and complications.”
In 48 hours, when the patient opens his eyes, we will have a little more certainty, adds RTL.
The press department did not confirm or comment on this information at the request of AFP.
RTL also states that, according to "some sources", no drainage was installed in Paris after the first operation.
Rocker was operated on at the Parc Monceau international clinic for a hot plateau.
The surgery, which was planned several days in advance, was performed by neurosurgeon Stephan Delajoux, a doctor well known in art circles.
However, the doctor was not available on Thursday to comment on the RTL information.
After the surgery, singer Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday for an infection that occurred after the operation.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, said on RTL radio on Thursday that his friend was going through a "bad period" but added that he "doesn't worry about the rocker" because he is a big "fighter".
“He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, but I told him he was doing a stupid thing because spending 12 hours on a plane after such an operation is no fun,” Mitchell said.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, calmed the situation, saying that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well to antibiotics" and that the infection was "stopped".
Mr. Camus also said that he had met Laetitia, the singer's wife, and that he had not noticed any particular concerns.
The singer's health problems have only multiplied since July, when he was hospitalized for nine days after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, to everyone's surprise, it was revealed that Johnny Hallyday had been operated on "a small tumour of the small intestine" and then on a weak infection.
At the end of September, the singer returned to his long tour "Tower 66", which is presented as his farewell.
But since then, every one of his health problems has been very much monitored and commented. Fans and journalists have noticed that the singer has difficulty moving on stage.
In mid-November, his team again had to deny a report of a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small pool: premiere of Bousquet in his favorite discipline
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a triple medalist at the 2009 World Championships in a large swimming pool, won the title at the 2009 European Championships in a small swimming pool in Istanbul in a discipline he particularly likes: 50m freestyle.
On the first day of the championship, on which overalls were last allowed, only three world records fell, although much more were expected.
One of them surpassed the Hungarian racer Evelyn Verrasztov<0xC3><0xA1> in the 200 m position race and the two remaining men's relays of Russia in the 4x50 m position race.
A great sadness for Bousquet, who made his way to the world record in the 50 m freestyle, which he already holds in the large pool (20.94).
In one of the two royal disciplines of swimming, 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman won with a final time of 20.53 seconds in the final, at which the premiere started ten swimmers instead of the usual eight.
Bousquet defeated Croat Duje Dragan (20.70) and Russian Sergei Fesikova (20.84), but failed to break the world record (20.30), as he predicted.
We can always dream of something better, but I said that if the world record is within my reach, I will try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore suits made of polyurethane, which will be banned from January 1.
The overalls have helped to 238 world records since February 2008 and their era ends in Istanbul, which was the first to host them in the same competition in 1999.
Wearing the jumpsuit this time did not help the Germans, Paul Biedermann, a double world champion in a large swimming pool in the summer in Rome, who had a world record at his fingertips.
The young swimmer failed to break the record, which holds the 400 meters freestyle (3:32.77), but still won with the second fastest time in his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian racer Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Dan Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't put everything in that race.
“I knew I wasn’t going to break the world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and I did my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious competitor in the future, Biedermann explained.
US: Zola's Romanesque sarcophagus plate was auctioned for $1.5 million
A record of the Romanesque sarcophagus, which belonged to no one but French writer Emil Zol, was auctioned for $1.5 million on Thursday, significantly more than was estimated, Sotheby's said.
The price of this two-metre-long and 63-cm-high front panel, dating from the third century A.D., was estimated at $150,000 to $250,000.
Marble "representing four Dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural decor, surrounded by satire and bakchants is a rare work, there are very few similar pieces in the world, perhaps four or five," Florent Heintz, Vice-President of the Soyuz Auction, told AFP on Tuesday.
The work was sold among a hundred others.
The sale is still ongoing, but it’s the subject that was probably the most targeted, Sotheby’s spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The fact that Emile Zola acquired this marble was discovered a few days ago.
The album was in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borgi family and then gradually appeared with the French actress Cecile Sorel, who decorated the bath with her in her private hotel in Paris, and with Paul Reynaud, Minister of the Third Republic in France and shortly before the President of the Council.
It remained shaded there for about fifty years.
Florent Heintz discovered during a search of the Louvre museum database that this plate was part of the "remains of Emil Zola" opened since 1903, a year after the death of the author "Therese Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
An interrupted attempt by President Zelaya to leave Honduras for Mexico.
Mexico on Thursday ruled that the conditions for the transfer of ousted President of Honduras, Manuel Zelayi, who rebels refused to provide a guarantee of safe departure, were not met.
“After the telephone conversation I had with President Zelaya last night, everything for now indicates that there is no way to carry out this transfer,” said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinoso.
A Mexican government plane that arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday for President Zelaya flew back, according to a source at the Directorate-General for Migration.
The Putschist government wanted to force President Zelaya to “demise” and to seek political asylum abroad, only in this way would it give him the chance to leave safely.
But the ousted president rejected these demands because he wanted to go to Mexico as the exiled head of state.
The Putschist government “has experienced yet another failure when it wanted me to resign... they wanted me to resign,” Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, often expressing the political crisis that has been going on in this Central American country for five months.
I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar here, added the ousted president, hidden in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months and played a few chords.
The Mexican embassy has asked us to provide a guarantee for safe transportation, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an asylum application, Interior Minister Oscar Raul Matute told the Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
"I will not seek asylum from any country," Zelaya said in an interview with Telesur, which is based in Caracas.
"If I ever leave Honduras, I will leave as president of the people of Honduras," he said.
Rumors of Zelaya's departure mobilized supporters of the overthrown president on Wednesday, who came to gather around the Brazilian embassy, where the military reinforced protection.
Brazil’s foreign minister, Celso Amorim, criticized the government’s stance.
They show their marginal stance on international standards, he added.
Zelaya, who came close to Venezuela’s socialist president Hugo Chavez, was ousted on June 28, the day he organized a public consultation in preparation for his re-election against the recommendations of the Supreme Court, the military, and Congress.
He unexpectedly returned from exile in Costa Rica on September 21 and found refuge at the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested and will be held accountable for the crime of "treason" he is accused of, the Putschist government claims.
On November 29, President Roberto Micheletti managed to organize presidential elections to replace President Zelaya.
In the controversial elections, recognized by the United States but condemned by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil, Porfirio Lobo won.
Three days later, Congress voted against President Zelaya's return to power until the end of his term on January 27.
Wall Street Rises, U.S. Trade Balance Stimulates Optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended up on Thursday with an increase and the U.S. trade balance results show an increase in both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones gained 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final closing data, the Dow Jones Industrial Average improved from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points and the Nasdaq, with a technological dominance from 7.13 points to 2190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor 500 index improved by 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1102.35 points.
We have good news coming from different parts of the economy, Lindsey Piegz of FTN Financial commented.
But we can't take it too seriously, she added, because the market is focused on "half a full glass".
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focus primarily on U.S. trade balance figures, “which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter.”
The U.S. trade deficit fell 7.6% in October from September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts, on the other hand, expected an increase in the deficit.
There has been an increase in both imports and exports.
The big news is the growing volume of trade, especially exports of goods, which is a reflection of the growth of the economies of the main trading partners of the United States, said Christopher Cornell of the research firm Economy.com.
However, in the United States, unemployment rose against all expectations last week and the number of job applicants reached 474,000.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers has fallen "to their lowest this year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The securities market has also fallen.
The Treasury's 10-year earnings rose to 3.482% from 3.423% on Tuesday evening and the 30-year earnings rose to 4.492% from 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of proponents of the regime chanted "Ladies in White"
Several hundred proponents of the Cuban regime chanted on Thursday the wives of political prisoners who met in Havana on the occasion of World Human Rights Day and prevented another demonstration at which dozens of dissidents were arrested.
About forty "Dame in white", wives or close political prisoners were queried directly on the street by supporters of the Raul Castro regime as they marched toward the center of the capital, demanding the release of political prisoners, the journalist reported.
Away with the Yankees!, "Soldiers!", "The streets belong to the revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Raul!" the regime's dissidents were chanted with raised fists.
Dissidents were eventually escorted by civilians who came “to ensure security.”
The day before, a similar demonstration against "Ladies in White" took place in Havana, but there were no injuries or arrests.
But in Havana’s Vedado district, about ten dissidents were detained by civilian police, who were also planning to protest on Thursday on the occasion of World Human Rights Day, a reporter told AFP.
According to the reporter, the police have ordered dissidents who have been shoved into civilian vehicles by proponents of the government regime using force.
Arrest of dissidents under similar conditions usually takes only a few hours.
The 2005 European Parliament Sakharov Prize laureates, "Ladies in White," organized an unauthorized march for "the release of all, according to dissent, about 200 political prisoners," said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Héctor Maceda is serving a 20-year sentence.
Maceda is one of a group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remain behind bars.
The Cuban authorities consider opponents to be “soldiers” or “agents” paid for by their main enemy, the United States.
A finished miracle, Cuban television brought a report of Thursday's demonstration of supporters of the government regime against the "opponents of the revolution".
Cuba, led by the Communist Party and the policies of the government of one party, is regularly accused by European or American non-governmental organizations of not respecting human rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech.
A madman with a knife killed an eighty-year-old man and wounded five people in Clichy-la-Garenne.
A man armed with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and wounded five others in the town of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) at peak time on Thursday afternoon.
According to preliminary results of the investigation, the assailant at the age of 28 allegedly attacked with two knives and for unknown reasons an eighty-year-old man in a pharmacy or in front of her, on 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, such is the version of the police and witnesses.
A severely injured old gentleman, born in 1929, died under the police union Alliance in the hospital as a result of his injuries.
In this pharmacy or in front of her, the attacker then attacked a pregnant woman and her partner.
The husband, aged about thirty, began to defend himself and was injured.
The first two seriously injured victims were taken to the same hospital where an 80-year-old man died.
The second victim's life is in danger, according to police sources, vital organs have been affected.
The pregnant woman then collapsed and was taken to hospital "in shock," a police source said.
An armed man, who was apparently under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, then fled to the street, still on boulevard Jean Jaur<0xC3><0xA8>s.
He injured two more people, apparently by accident: a 30-year-old and a 40-year-old man, the other seriously.
How all this happened is not entirely clear, for it all happened in the evening.
Armed with two butcher knives, he carried the cross behind his back, said Arnaud Pressé, head of the Alliance syndicate in Hauts-de-Seine.
Several passers-by, including young people, tried to stop and disarm the insane, according to testimony gathered by AFP.
I saw a 30-year-old man in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to catch him.
They failed, because he was quite strong, commented on the situation by Alberto, a waiter from a nearby bar.
A crowd, including a city policeman, threw him, who broke his wrist.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at level 61, two city police officers, including their commander, tried to arrest the gunman and were wounded by the fist, a police source said.
The incident took place in one of the main streets of Clichy-la-Garenne, where many shops are located.
Passers-by came to tell me there was an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a seventy-year-old man on the ground, put him in a safe place, and noticed big wounds on his stomach, Frederic Allione, a thirty-five-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a 30-year-old man came along who also had a knife wound.
A man who did not have an identity card was later arrested by the state police.
The Nanterre prosecutor referred the case to the Hauts-de-Seine Regional Police Investigation Department (SDPJ 92).
The suspect was taken to the hospital on Thursday night.
He's in custody, waiting for an interrogation.
The police source did not rule out his placement in a psychiatric hospital.
Another police source said six police officers were needed to handle him at the police station in Clichy, where he was transferred.
He was "totally out of his mind" as "all madmen of this type, whose strength in action increases tenfold".
U.S.: Polanski's lawyer again calls for end to criminal prosecution
A lawyer for Polish-French director Roman Polanski on Thursday again asked in Los Angeles (California, western United States) to stop the criminal prosecution against his client, who is currently in his Swiss residence due to a moral affair that occurred thirty years ago.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer for the director of the film "The Pianist", criticized three judges of the second district appeals court in California for serious errors that occurred during the court retrial at the time of the events in 1977.
“I demand an end to the prosecution now and immediately,” Hummel said, adding that Laurence Rittenband “had a freeze in his back” from the conduct of the judge who ruled on the case at the time.
According to him, the judge (who had already died in the meantime) had supposedly dealt with a prosecutor before the verdict, who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to jail – a serious violation of the law.
Information about this interview appeared in the document "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and wanted), from the mouth of the prosecutor himself, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells eventually stated at the end of September that he "lied" to the author of the document.
In the event that the court refuses to stop the criminal proceedings, Hummel’s lawyer will request a court summons in which he will be able to provide evidence of his claim.
The applicant reiterated what had already been said at the first hearing, namely that no serious examination of the application for the cessation of criminal proceedings would take place until Roman Polanski appeared before the court.
The 76-year-old director fled the United States in 1978, before a court ruled in a case of “illegal sexual intercourse” with a 13-year-old girl.
Since then, he has never entered the United States again.
L.A. Deputy Attorney Phyllis Asayam said Roman Polanski "should be there to take part in a court reprimand."
In this case, we want to show not only Roman Polaski, but also other defendants that it is possible to escape? asks Mrs. Asayam.
It is the view that the director "requests a favor from the court, while at the same time contemptuous of his authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to make a decision, also stressed that "there are other alternatives to escape".
Hummel was not the only lawyer who asked to stop Roman Polanski’s prosecution.
The victim's legal representative, Samantha Geimer, has also again called for an end to the prosecution.
She recalled that her client would no longer tolerate the perpetual harassment every time the Polanski case arose, adding: “No one in this room can say that the trial was fair.”
Thirty-two years, that’s enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on September 26 on U.S. orders
After more than two months behind bars, he was released into a home prison in his cottage in Gstaad, where he is awaiting possible execration.
Wall Street ends without direction, it is slowed by the rising dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Friday with no direction, the market tumbles between indicators that are better than expected in the US and the rising price of the dollar: the Dow Jones gained +0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing data, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced from 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points and the Nasdaq, with a technological dominance of 0.55 points, ended at 2,190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
To be honest, the market is very calm, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in a narrow range, the volume of trade has greatly decreased and I think it will remain that way until the end of the year.
This trend has also been confirmed by the publication of economic indicators that are better than expected and that have "helped to improve the market mood in terms of economic recovery stability," said analyst Charles Schwab.
In the U.S., retail sales grew by 1.3% in November, for the second month in a row, and much more than expected.
According to the preliminary estimate of the index from the University of Michigan, U.S. consumer confidence also returned and rose sharply to 73.4 in December from 67.4 in the previous month.
However, the indexes have been slowed by a new rise in the dollar against the euro, which is the highest in the last two months, "pushing down sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Technological stocks are losing ground under their feet.
The securities market has fallen.
The income of the state treasury with a 10-year outlook rose to 3.540% compared to 3.482% on Wednesday evening and with a 30-year outlook increased to 4.497% compared to 4.492% the day before.
The election of Miss World again in South Africa.
After a month-long journey across South Africa, 112 candidates for the Miss World title are set to exceed their goal of becoming the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion television viewers.
This great celebration of beauty was held in the vicinity of Johannesburg for the second year, and so far five candidates have been promoted to the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariata Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbrataru and Yanbing Mao from Canada were chosen Miss Sport or Miss Top Model during their African stay.
It was a real whirlwind of events.
It was amazing to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban or Cape Town.
“I’ve seen so many things and I have so many experiences!” said Miss Sierra Leone.
The contest, which will be held in the South African Republic for the ninth time, will be broadcast live from Midrand, in the north of Johannesburg, starting at 5pm (15pm World Time).
I couldn't have dreamed of a more beautiful land where I would put my crown.
It was a fascinating experience.
I am happy to have experienced it twice, said Miss World Ksenia Sukhin, in the hot southern summer.
For the young Russia, her second stay in the South African Republic was accompanied by numerous meetings with other candidates and a new discovery of the country and its "breathtaking country".
After a month of performances, rehearsals, press meetings and safari, Miss is now focusing on the competition itself.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000, who is also contesting Aishwarya Rai, the 1994 winner, both of whom have become Bollywood stars.
Being crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world is every woman’s dream, but it’s not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with the crown, says Miss India with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, the 59th year will be held in the spirit of music and dance.
The candidates will appear in traditional costumes and, of course, in swimsuits.
The show will be hosted by Chinese TV host Angela Chow, former beauty queen Michelle McLean of South Africa, and Miss World Chairman Steve Douglas.
The South African Republic has shown that it can welcome the world with a warmth that is hard to cope with, said Julia Morley, president of the Miss World competition.
Like last year, the candidates took part in a safari, visited the famous town of Soweto, this time by bike, and tasted local cuisine.
An extraordinary event was a meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hand.
Unusual for the president, said Miss Sierra Leone.
Undoubtedly the most beautiful memory will remain the draw in Cape Town (in the southwest of the country) for the World Cup, which will be held in June 2010, and which helped the country to support the event a little more.
I could have met people I never dreamed of.
I will definitely be returning to the 2010 World Cup, says Alice Taticchi of Italy with enthusiasm.
According to David's son, reports of Hallyday's condition are "very positive."
The news of Johnny Hallyday’s condition is “very positive,” as his son David assured us when he arrived at the airport in Los Angeles on Friday, where he flew to visit his father, who has been hospitalized for several days.
The reports are very positive.
“He’s very strong and everything is going very well,” said David Hallyday at the time of his departure from the plane, which he flew from Paris just after 13:00 local time (21:00 World Time).
The singer's son, who acted calmly, said he would arrive "as soon as possible" at the Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> hospital in Los Angeles, where Johny Hallyday was admitted on Monday due to a post-operative infection caused by a ruptured intervertebral disc surgery he underwent on Nov. 26.
According to a press release, the singer was "introduced into artificial sleep" for the sake of comfort, which is meant to prevent pain and facilitate treatment.
Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized by doctors at the Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles due to an infection of a sore intervertebral disc after surgery on November 26 in Paris.
Due to the serious damage caused by this intervention, the singer had to be re-operated on the night from Wednesday to Thursday.
According to AFP, his wife Laeticia attended a school performance of the French lyceum in Los Angeles on Friday morning, attended by their daughter Jade.
Yves Catoné, head of the Department of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology at La Pitié-Salp<0xC3><0xAA>tri<0xC3><0xA8>re Hospital, announced that he will fly to Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer strongly accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, a neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
They told us it was a massacre.
Surgeons in Los Angeles said they were upset, Camus said.
I have heard about the possibility of a future trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "went too fast to Los Angeles with the permission of his Parisian surgeon".
Personally, I spoke to the doctor on the phone and he assured me that this trip was not a problem, which surprised me greatly, since I myself had already suffered from intervertebral palsy twice, he added.
A moment earlier, on the RTL radio station, he said that the singer apparently flew away after the Paris operation without a drench, without anything.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in artistic circles.
He operated on actress Maria Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at the clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he worked at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to remove the haematoma caused by bleeding into the brain.
However, he is also a doctor with a dark reputation, convicted several times in cases of neglect of medical care, for tax evasion and fraud.
Chamber of Medicine lawyer Olivier Metzner called him a “man without scruples” who is “regularly” summoned before the medical chamber, and who cannot even be “recommanded from a distance”.
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on the matter on Friday through his lawyer David Koubbi.
He said the procedure had "absolutely good progress" and the postoperative examination was "normal".
The operation was not of a haemorrhagic nature, therefore it was not necessary to introduce a drain," he added.
The singer’s health problems have been on the rise since this summer, and in any case, his next tour seems to be left with a question mark.
It is clear that the date for the resumption of the planned tour on January 8 (in Amiens, see red.) appears to be too close, Camus said.
The UDF raises the tone and urges the Nouveau Centre party not to continue using their abbreviation.
The UDF, controlled by MoDemFran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou, on Friday reacted to an attempt by Nouveau Centre president Hervé Morin to take over the former Giscardo party by not using the abbreviation in any media under threat of prosecution.
Hervé Morin has publicly announced his intention to acquire the abbreviation UDF with the fact that Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou does not deserve to bear its legacy after he handed his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defense, whose party is a partner of the UMP, planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday in front of the National Council of the Nouveau Centre (NC).
This step was supported by the MP Hervé de Charett (former pro-UMP now for NC), who ascribes ownership to the UDF brand, as he was the first to have it registered with the National Institute of Industrial Property (l'Institut national de la propriété industrielle) in 2004.
But on Friday night, a UDF committee headed by Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou’s friends, who do not intend to be evicted, stepped down from their silence and formally requested the minister and lawmakers to stop using the abbreviation and hand over ownership of the trademark, under the threat of criminal prosecution.
In recent days, you have raised alarming statements that you will propose to your political movement to retake the abbreviation UDF, writes the Association in its letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the committee, including Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of the MoDem Centre or Senator Jean Arthui.
At the same time, you considered it appropriate to place on your promotional materials and on the welcome website of your movement the name + Nouveau centre+, with the slogan +UDF today +, the signatories of the letter also state.
As you are aware, you have no right to use this abbreviation, the UDF committee explains, requesting the NC movement "immediately remove all UDF name mentions from all promotional materials, including (its) websites".
At the same time, it asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer the ownership of the trademark to the legitimate owners".
If you do not do so, we will turn to the courts to respect the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories note.
In their letter, they state that the UDF "has been a full-fledged political movement since 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends "elected" a departure in 2007, "to create a competitive movement, like others in 2002, to found the UMP.
According to them, the Nouveau centre has no right to use the abbreviation UDF (Union pour la démocratie fran<0xC3><0xA7>aise).
At the same time, they recall that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 to join MoDem for three years and to create a committee to defend the "moral and material interests" of the association founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the committee continues, "when he registered the trademark," he was "not a member of the UDF for three years", but of the UMP.
In a scandalous and fraudulent way, he used the non-existent registration of an acronym to do so on his own account.
This inattentiveness begins to turn into a crime, they declare, and then ironically they express themselves to the NC strategy: "It seems to us that in both politics and ordinary life it is more valuable to create a name for yourself than to withdraw from anonymity by fraudulently adopting a name that has no name."
Liliane Bettencourt’s case: Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of a state of weakness.
A Nanterre court on Friday decided to sue artist Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise-Marie Banier and make a verdict on whether he used the 80-year-old billionaire’s state of weakness to strip her of part of her fortune, for which her daughter Liliane Bettencourt blamed him.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his famous photographs, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of a state of weakness, a criminal offence for which a maximum sentence of 3 years and a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>375,000 is imposed.
This decision confirms that there is indeed a process going on in the case, which can be described as the family saga of one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter attack each other and fight for the control of the L'Oréal cosmetic empire.
However, the 15th criminal court also ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliana Bettencourt, which should be carried out by a college of three doctors.
The heir and main shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to undergo such an investigation, certainly not under the conditions offered by the Public Prosecutor's Office in Nanterre during the investigation.
Doctors who will be elected on Friday should prepare a report by 10 March 2010 and at the same time state whether Liliana Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness, and during which period.
I think he's gonna go through with it.
I will talk to her about it," said Mr Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, after the hearing.
As for Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bettencourt-Meyers’ lawyer, Olivier Metzner, he welcomed the court’s decision.
It's an excellent report. ... Expertise will show that he manipulated this old lady in need of protection (Mr. Banier), he confirmed.
It’s been two years since Liliana Bettencourt’s only daughter began criminal proceedings against Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier, a photographer and all-rounder who she blames for years of using her mother’s state of infirmity to get a gift of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 billion in checks, life insurance contracts or paintings.
But Liliane Bettencourt has always denied being manipulated by a photographer she considers a long-term friend.
While the court had to assess the validity of the lawsuit filed by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers’ Friday court speech had at times turned into a family hour of truth.
Liliana Bettencourt’s lawyer submitted three letters to her notary in 1999, 2003 and 2005, expressing her distrust of her husband, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In a 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt adds, “You could explain to my daughter that I have been writing to Banier for fifteen years once or twice a day.
Ever since she got married, I have never been able to talk to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise."
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor’s Office again found that the complainant’s conduct was not justified, all the more so when the guardian judge in those days rejected her application to initiate proceedings to issue legal protection for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully capable of participating in court, not under protection or guardianship.
No one else will act for her," prosecutor Marie-Christine Daubigney said.
Finally, the Court decided that Ms Bettencourt-Meyers's case would be heard at the time of the opening of the proceedings.
Management revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
Unless anything changes in the management of large French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence was futile...
For more than a decade, the behaviour of management of large companies towards employees has been reminiscent of the approach of companies towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it is a question of employees identifying themselves with "values" determined from the mountain, as it was before when it was necessary to impose on consumers the products that came out of the attack.
By becoming the center of business companies, the marketing revolution has aligned the strategy of conquering the market in the right direction... although authoritarian efforts to impose products, different from customer preferences, come back regularly!
The passive attitude of employees can lead to deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault companies are only a visible part of a much more widespread general phenomenon that affects mainly management staff.
This demobilization adversely affects the development of all the intellectual functions of society, including research and development, and more importantly, economic intelligence.
And indeed, the EI “requires all stakeholders (...) to have an active approach and the ability to foresee” and demands from employees commitments that are completely at odds with the revenues of authoritarian management.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution that aims to put employees at the center of the interest of the company as well as the client.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion polls.
Will internal opinion polls - like a questionnaire submitted to Orange employees - contribute to a revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
Mainly because I have already convinced myself that in the face of a new situation, the structure will return to what it has always done after various detours!
Moreover, authoritarianism, as one of the pathologies of power, increases in proportion to the severity of one’s own failures.
And finally, because most managers have a simplified view of human behavior.
Because they are graduates of colleges for engineers, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
For the sake of convenience of thought, they adopt an old behaviorist theory, currently revived by the "neuroscience" of the United States and widely disseminated without much knowledge by scientific institutes and the media.
With the "sic" involvement of managers being possible, a recent survey by Ipsos showed on Figaro.fr, which only strengthens managers in their position of mechanical control, unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors.
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises presupposes the adoption of the final vision of human behavior.
It consists in incorporating basic insight into all management intentions and practices: For employees, commitments to the company will only be possible if they appear as a clear means to achieve their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Currently, this concept of employee motivation is only concerned with the study of Motivational Functional Analysis.
These studies have shown that they evaluate their businesses on the basis of predefined doxy, which allows them, through an image that tells about the company, to evaluate what it offers them to realize their life goals.
By identifying and measuring these mobilization factors, managers can control, predict and anticipate their “social performance” and put their human resource management “on track”.
This creates a breeding ground for the development of sound and effective economic intelligence.
In a speech in Oslo, Obama called for a “just war” and deserved praise from the right.
The U.S. right on Friday welcomed a speech delivered by Barack Obama the day before in Oslo, pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate defended the concept of a “just war” against the United States’ enemies.
Conservatives, who initially ridiculed the award for Obama on October 9, this time applauded the presidential speech, including Sarah Palin, a former presidential candidate in the 2008 election.
I liked what she said, Palin, a muse of the right-wing Republican wing, told USA Today, adding that she herself had expressed the "sometimes necessary" war in her memoirs that are just coming out.
War is, of course, the last thing Americans would like to have to do, but it is necessary.
All terrorists must be detained there, he believes.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq from his predecessor George W. Bush, on Thursday in Oslo justified the deployment of forces and used the speech to clarify his decision to send another 30,000 troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another Obama opponent, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really very good, congratulated by the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who praised above all the President's mention of "the existence of evil in the world".
In a way, I considered this speech to be quite historic, Gingrich said during an interview on the radio show "The Takeaway".
A former MP, who some consider a possible Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential election, was thrilled to see the "left-wing president" remind members of the Nobel Prize committee "that they themselves would not be free and could not pass on the prize for peace if the use of force was not exist".
According to Michael Gerson, former speechwriter George W. Bush, now editor of the Washington Post, Obama delivered a “very American speech.”
Not only did he introduce himself as a "world citizen" as usual, but he "spoke like an American president" and reminded Europeans "that they live in a safe bubble that they didn't create themselves, and that they don't do too much to preserve it," Gerson said.
Among the few disgruntled on the right is the Bush-era hawk, former U.N. ambassador John Bolton, who described the speech as "uniform, swollen and uninspired," as reported on the National Review Online website.
Left of the president, for example, Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich is appalled at Barack Obama’s justification for the use of force.
“When we wrap war in the packaging of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people,” he warned.
However, the middle-left press has a positive attitude towards the president.
Although the Los Angeles Times continues to find the award premature for Obama, it rated his performance as "overperformance" even for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech should serve as a guide to international decisions to resolve conflicts, combat poverty and oppression," the California daily said in a statement.
Obama “spoke the speech as needed,” the New York Times reported, calling the speech “simple and instructive.”
Road Carriers: Three marathons to an agreement that will save the supply of supplies for Christmas.
After three negotiating marathons, road transport unions and the TLF, the only employers’ organization that remained until the end, reached an agreement on Friday night that ended the strike call and the threat that hung over the supply of supplies for Christmas.
The Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, expressed "joy" at the signing of the agreement on Friday after several negotiations that began on Wednesday morning.
After the second night of the talks, the negotiators left early Friday morning in the hope that the text of the agreement would be signed as soon as possible by the end of the morning.
And this despite the fact that three employers’ organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew from the negotiations.
But it took more than six hours for the meeting to start at 11:00 to reach an agreement and for the agreement to be signed at 18:00.
The conflict “would hurt businesses a lot” and “would threaten to disrupt the holidays at the end of the year,” Bussereau said.
The text includes a 4% wage increase for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and a 2.9% increase for the highest wages (international transport).
The hourly wage for the lowest wage increases from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8.72 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9.06.
It’s not much, but there’s a lot of effort behind it, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Tonight, we're giving our members orders not to blockade, no blockade of supply centers.
But there may be a few more opponents who are not satisfied," he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, welcomed the "correct deal", although it was difficult to admit the increase in high wages due to international competition.
According to him, there will be an increase of 170 euros per month at the lowest wages and 100 to 120 euros at the highest.
It is a common sense and respect agreement with employees, said CMaxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the "historic agreement".
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT), this is an "acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for a 3% revaluation of travel expenses and a report on the state of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also allow a focus on the issue of the 13th salary and the modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled "a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million reduction in corporate payroll taxes" that was the subject of a government amendment to the 2009 budget bill that was voted on by the National Assembly on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The government will ask the Senate for a "similar" vote.
The signature allows this agreement to apply first to enterprises that are members of this organization, later to the entire field, in case of extension by the Ministry of Labour.
It will take place "as soon as possible," said Bussereau.
The whole process can only be slowed down by the disagreement of employers’ organisations.
The FNTR is talking about "bad trade" as <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million "has already been offered to the sector as part of the carbon tax compensation".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to emergency action, not as a result of mutual analysis, but in order not to eat turkeys at the time of the upcoming Christmas holidays, Unostra complained.
According to Otre, the agreement is likely to bury a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises in the sector in the next 12 months.
RER A suburban trains: traffic interruption on weekends, trade unions dissatisfied with the proposals of the transport company RATP.
The interruption of transport on the RER A suburban train line, which is the largest public transport line in France, will continue over the weekend, as Friday's negotiations between the unions and the RATP leadership on the next day of the strike did not lead to any concrete results in the demand for premiums.
On Saturdays and Sundays, i.e. the days of the important shopping weekend before Christmas, trains will run only between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m., on the main section (between La Défence and Nation) every second train will run, except for this section only one train out of four.
The connection to the SNCF will be interrupted in Nanterre Prefecture and passengers will be forced to transfer to another train.
The Galleries Lafayette, which expect more than 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP was trying to secure a connection with the big department stores".
The RER A line runs from the west to the east of the Parisian agglomeration.
The RATP-managed section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, one out of two trains were in operation at the peak and virtually no trains were running outside the peak as planned.
As on Thursday, the inhabitants of Ile de France arranged differently and there was no confusion on the pitches.
So early in the morning, there were far fewer people in Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) than usual, partly because of the lack of pupils and students.
Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), explained that he got up "an hour and a half early to be sure he would arrive in time."
Saint-Lazare railway station was not overcrowded, the SNCF state railway announced, because a greater number of founders and guardians of order were predicted.
Suburban RER A trains operated by SNCF in the direction of or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare station with a connection to the metro.
The next general meetings of the strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, at which the results of Friday afternoon's meeting with the leadership, which the unions rated as "weak", will be evaluated.
RER management proposes negotiations on a special protocol for RER A suburban trains on all sides, adjustment of working hours, career path, etc.
However, this is not the case for drivers who demand a well-deserved premium, according to Thierry Garon (Department of Industry).
The RATP even postponed the premium proposals for the time being, which aggravated the CGT by the fact that the management "was not able to solve the problem, while the travel carriers and the SNCF were able to do so".
At the new meeting, which is scheduled for Monday, "the conditions for the performance of the profession will be reviewed in more detail," the transport companies RATP said.
Which was the reason the unionists thought the company was "making fun of weekend travelers."
In the morning, about 150 drivers were employed by a business committee at his Paris headquarters.
The leadership, which has so far refused any discussion during the strike, therefore decided to meet in the interest of "calm down".
There is a risk that the conflict will spread to the RER B line on Tuesday, after UNSA and the Independent announce a strike emergency.
The unions are asking for a premium of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (Juh), Independants (Independants)) and are making it difficult for the deteriorating working conditions on this line, which carries a million passengers daily.
Drivers of RER suburban trains earn 2,200 to 2,700 euros of gross wages and 600 to 650 euros of premiums for irregular working hours and for work on Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice has dissolved for the Kurdish side, and this decision has serious consequences.
The Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday ruled to abolish the main pro-Kurdish party in the country. This decision immediately sparked protests in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision can greatly complicate the task of the government, which is trying to give the Kurdish community a friendly hand and try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) has been dissolved because it has become "a hub of activities that threaten the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," Supreme Court Chairman Hasim Kilic told reporters after four days of negotiations.
The decision was taken unanimously by 11 judges, when a majority of seven votes was needed to dissolve the party, Kili<0xC3><0xA7> said, adding that 37 party cadres, including its president Ahmet Türk and MEP Aysela Tuglukova, were banned from participating in political life for five years.
At the same time, the judge announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr Türk and Mrs Tuglukova and the confiscation of the party's assets by the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP party has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 500).
The party’s leadership has already warned before the verdict that MPs would rather leave Parliament than act as MPs without political authority.
The decision is a continuation of the process initiated in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation, Abdurrahman Yalcinkay, who accuses the DTP of obedience to the "commands" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider to be a terrorist organization.
Many observers are convinced that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party says it has no "basic connection" to the PKK, but refuses to label it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The verdict comes as the government lends a friendly hand to the Kurdish community and offers a number of measures to strengthen their rights and tries to limit the support of the Kurds for the PKK to end the conflict.
The DTP leadership confirmed that the dissolution of the party could lead to a resumption of tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where in recent weeks many demonstrations have erupted against the conditions under which PKK leader Abdullah <0xC3><0x96>calan is detained in clashes with police.
Since the announcement of the justice decision, thousands of demonstrators have gathered in front of the DTP headquarters in Diyarbakir, a large city in the southeast that is inhabited mostly by Kurds.
Police used tear grenades and water cannons, and demonstrators threw Molotov cocktails or fired stones from washing machines.
About 100 people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr Türk said that the decision of justice only "prolongs desperation".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (the Kurds, note red.) by banning the party, he said in the press.
The government, made up of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also condemned the decision.
We are on the principle of non-disruption of the parties.
It doesn’t solve anything, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
This decision is a complete rejection of the democratic proposals launched by the government, commented political scientist Ahmet Insel.
Of course, we can expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK reported one of the deadliest attacks in northern Turkey, which killed seven soldiers three days earlier.
The snow can come
A nice crispy winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to harass citizens, says the head of the winter technical services department of the FES.
But so that its employees can test and learn to control all the vehicle technology.
This could be the first time this weekend, according to meteorologists.
More than 300 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES is proceeding according to a precise plan.
As soon as it snows in Frankfurt and the temperatures drop below zero, they go to 20 so-called A-sections, explains Brauburger.
These sections include major and transit routes such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also arrivals for firefighters, suburban public transport lines, pedestrian zones and downhill sections such as Atzelbergstraße.
FES service starts at three o'clock in the morning.
If necessary, it is necessary to sprinkle in a maximum of three hours with moist salt, which holds better, about 1040 kilometers.
That’s why the FES starts at three o’clock at night, “so that the roads are free until the transport starts to work.”
It's not easy when it starts snowing until 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the head of the winter technical services department, "because no one is willing to make room for the dumpsters."
Only when there is not so much snow, are the arrival and connecting communications, which also include the Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is the side and side roads.
Brauburger knows they're gonna complain there.
At five o'clock in the morning, FES pedestrians set off on their way, preferably cleaning up dangerous places and crossings.
FES can’t usually take care of all the bike paths.
In Frankfurt, there is a special service that monitors bridges from 22 to 4.30, says Brauber.
Since they form a rapid glacier, the dumpers leave immediately as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
The police will also call them if necessary.
The Cradle of Dinosaurs
The Tawa Hallae looked like a lot of other carnivorous dinosaurs: The animal, two meters long and 1.50 meters high, ran along two strong hind limbs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short front limbs with swollen claws.
If this species lived a few million years later, there would be nothing extraordinary.
Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues in Thursday's issue of Science writes that Tawa Hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body features.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in present-day New Mexico, which was then in the equator arid region of the supercontinent Pangea.
Tawa opens a new window to the earlier evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about relationships, expansions, and signs of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began excavations at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
“Sometimes we found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, which is unprecedented for triassic sediments,” said team member Randall Irmis of the Museum of Natural History in Utah.
Some of the bones were quickly identified by scientists as a new species.
During the excavations, they collected the remains of a total of five individuals.
The finding confirms theories about the early history of dinosaurs.
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god Hopi.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an unusual finding: "Triassic dinosaur fossils are very rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not share this enthusiasm without reservation.
This finding is not particularly sensational, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current scientific opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are not complete, so the attribution of pradinosaurs is usually controversial.
Experts discuss, for example, when lizards split into three main lines of development: carnivorous theropods, to which later belonged Tyranosaurus rex, Velociraptor and also birds, "long-necked" four-legged sauropods such as the lizards and their relatives, and the herbivorous orchid.
After analyzing Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa Hallae is the original terapod.
It exhibits an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
On the skull of Tawa Hallae, for example, researchers found evidence of air sacs that even the descendants of theropod birds have.
Thanks to air sacs, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
At Tawa Hallae, the bones of the spine were apparently partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with airbags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the relative lineage of the giant sauropods later also had air sacs and light bones, this useful innovation has probably already created a common ancestor of both groups.
At least three waves of migration into North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, scientists have concluded that lizards first appeared there.
According to this, the three lines of development split early and spread from South America to all the continents that then formed a unified Earth mass as the supercontinent Pangea.
She would also speak for the fact that the team, together with Tawa hallae, found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related theropods.
These three cannot come from one common, migrated ancestor, the scientists argue.
We believe there have been at least three waves of migration into North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the scientific study.
Of course, there are contradictions as well.
One even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to the group of the heaviest dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His assumption could put together a distorted picture, because in South America, a lot of primitive dinosaur fossils have been preserved, with other continents rarely found.
As dinosaurs have proven that they evolved from a relatively rare lineage of reptiles to the dominant vertebrates of the earth in the Middle Ages, it remains a riddle.
During the Triassic, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today’s crocodiles and flying lizards and countless other lizards.
Around the end of the Triassic, dinosaurs spread throughout the world and many new species evolved, while relatives died out and interfaced the Triassic and Jurassic.
The success story didn’t last forever.
There are two hypotheses on how to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a mass extinction, which the dinosaurs accidentally survived, but the reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs adapted better, so they could outshine the competition.
However, the success story didn’t last forever.
150 million years later, the impact of the meteorite helped another group of animals, which also evolved into the Triassic and has since lived in the shadows: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
The list includes professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna, or Berkeley, California.
Docents from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo, Berlin or Bremen joined.
The police clearing of the occupied casino of the Frankfurt Goethe University has taken care of a worldwide upheaval.
278 professors and lecturers at Goethe University, as well as universities across Germany, Europe and North and South America, stand in solidarity with the protesting students at the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, the president "does not approve" incited police intervention.
Because the walls were plastered and the works of art, university president Werner Müller-Estler had the building, which was occupied last week by striking students and lecturers, cleaned up.
Five of the students were injured.
The damage, the signatories say, does not justify "violent dissolution of self-organized teaching of students and teachers by the police command".
Clearing up constitutes "unacceptable interference" with the freedoms of research and science.
An exclusive focus on vandalism serves to “illegalize and criminalize protest” and distracts from the content.
The presidium avoided the necessary discussion.
Speakers call for the cessation of criminal prosecution.
It is alleged that the majority of strikers did not support material damage.
Justifiable protest
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German Trade Union are also in solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for one’s own future, says the mysterious Earth Youth Verdi Alexander Klein.
Hessian science minister Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) is defending the university’s president and police.
We are grateful to the President of the University.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, she said Thursday in Aktuellen Stunde in the Wiesbaden Landtag.
We have an understanding for protest, but we have no understanding for vandalism, said CDU MP Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, the opposition factions of the SPD, the Greens and the Left saw it.
The CDU takes painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, Janine Wissler (Linke) said.
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, there was a clearing.
Linee submitted a proposal calling on the interior minister to report on the police deployment.
New Silicon-Valley
For many years it was a secret city, inaccessible to visitors from the West.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital of Moscow, in the Soviet Union it was a strictly guarded location where secret weapons research was carried out.
Today, this district with 216,000 inhabitants, located 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important micro- and nanoelectronic research and production centers are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives from Greenburgh have established contacts with the Frankfurt Riedberg Science Centre - with university institutions and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday they signed in Frankfurt Zelenograd and Ridberg the "Protocol on Close Cooperation".
The Russian delegation was led by Moscow Mayor Yuri Roslyak and Zelenograd Prefect Anatoly Smirnov, and the head of planning Edwin Schwarz signed for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises engaged in natural science research will go to a seminar in Zelenograd.
Scientist exchanges
This is an ongoing scientific exchange.
It is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be able to hold onto the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian scientific companies want to get jobs in Germany.
Zelenograd is home to major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronic Engineering, the large Sitronics Group and Rossiyskaya Elektronika.
The district was founded in 1958 as the so-called "socialist planned city" for arms research.
Zelenograd (literally "Green City") got its name from the wooded hilly landscape into which research facilities are planted.
The Stuttgart Brake
The Stuttgart 21 dimension cannot be sufficiently prepared at all.
For the supporters of the project, this is simply the "new heart of Europe".
The S21 is more than a station launch, more than a monstrous building that will plunge the capital of Baden-Württemberg into a desperate construction chaos for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 80s.
The main railway stations that ended up in the city centre were then considered 19th-century transport-technical fossils, which act as the brakes of modern rail transport, because it took an enormous amount of time to turn the locomotives from the rear to the front.
To drive, to stop for a moment, to go on - that's how it should work.
And that’s why the main train stations are disappearing: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: the transit station, which lies about halfway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava on the Trans-European Railways – hence the slogan of “the heart of Europe”.
It actually starts with the S21, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
The very ambitious designers themselves realized that in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals, the start of construction is almost non-financial.
Since there have been modern shuttle trains with motor and control vehicles on both ends, the main train stations no longer have trouble getting in and out.
Still: Starting with Stuttgart 21, including the new ICE route to Ulm.
It was enforced by local and local politicians.
The railways cooperate, also because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project in the Republic are borne by the taxpayer and not by the state corporation.
Urbanistically, the project can still be excused in some way.
A new urban space will emerge, which - if we trust the computer images of the designers - will contain a lot of greenery.
The S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The transit station and the construction of the line are intended for passenger transport, which - typically in the 80s - was attributed to a huge increase.
At that time, there was no competition for cheap flights.
Modern transport policies must, however, first and foremost be about strengthening freight transport, because rail transport is far more environmentally friendly than road freight.
But the new route is not suitable for freight trains due to steep climbs.
Even more serious is the fact that S21 indirectly affects many other railway projects.
A good six billion euros should have been buried in Swabia.
That's the official number.
Experts consider 10 to 15 billion to be real.
It is clear that in the next decade there will be a lack of funding for other nodes and bottlenecks in the network.
On the list of the Ministry of Transport there are sixty major projects.
One of the most important is the construction of a 180-kilometer-long route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, this route has been built at a slower pace.
There would have to be a lot of pressure here.
But S21 will be like a brake.
The route through the Rhine Valley will become the backbone of a bottle of international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.
The Government is examining the judgment on the airport
The Land Government has left open in the Wiesbaden Landtag whether it will go against the ruling of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) on the ban on night flights and let it revise it.
The CDU/FDP coalition has mandated experts to legally assess the more than 400-page VGH ruling, Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP) said.
The VGH in Kassel today explained in writing that the state would have to revise the nocturnal ban in the event of the construction of the planned northwestern runway of Frankfurt Airport.
Permission to fly 17 flights between 23:00 and 5:00 a.m., as assumed by the state government, is not in line with the law mandated to protect the population from nighttime aerial noise.
The Coalition must decide by January 4 whether to request a revision of the ruling.
The opposition criticized the postponement and urged the government representative to renounce the revision of the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD chief Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on the CDU and FDP to return to promises of a night flight ban that they had made before the election, otherwise it could be seen as a "breach of the word".
It’s damn hard if you can keep your word, Greens chief Tarek Al-Wazir said in a reference to the FDP’s election slogan “We keep our word.”
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel's plea, the country's government trying to get to its night flights by "transforming the law and tricks".
Exact legal control needs its time.
The coalition does not want to work on the basis of a "quick first impression".
We need a realistic decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
His faction’s statements to ban night flights have never been the same as those of the opposition.
U.S. Banks Paying for Aid
America’s crisis-shocked big banks are getting rid of the shackles of the state.
On Wednesday, Bank of America paid a total of $45 billion (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 billion) in aid from the bank’s rescue fund Tarp.
According to a report by CNBC, Citigroup is also planning to repay state aid.
Thus, the institutions want to get rid of the restrictions that occurred when accepting money - the limitation of bonus payments to managers and the payment of high fees.
Bank of America has raised $19 billion in net cash from investors thanks to exchangeable bonds.
The rest of the amount was taken from her treasury, which was filled, among other things, thanks to trade union sales.
On Wednesday night, Kenneth Lewis, the bank’s chief executive, thanked the U.S. taxpayer: “Money injections have helped us overcome a difficult time.
The Monetary Institute hurt itself at the height of the financial crisis by taking over investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup also wants to free itself from its obligations to the state by obtaining money on the capital market.
CNBC said the U.S. bank could have announced a capital increase of about $20 billion as early as Thursday.
The Citigroup spokesman did not want to comment on this.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley paid for the aid.
Quick-selection
It went faster than I had expected.
The station introduced the successor just two weeks after ZDF’s board of directors expelled editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender.
Last night, the gremium was supposed to be dealt with by that person.
Favorite was Peter Frey, head of ZDF studios in Berlin.
However, the station did not confirm this - officially, so as not to advance the process.
But the role could also be played by the fact that they did not want to harm ZDF intendant Markus Schächter if the proposal was not passed to the board of directors.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the greece.
The outcome of the vote was not known prior to the conclusion of this issue.
Two weeks ago, the Schächter board of directors failed with its proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender by another five years.
Only seven members voted for Brender, seven were against him, and Brender's loss of office was a bitter defeat for Schächter, although it was to be expected.
The EU majority on the board of directors had signaled several weeks before the election that they did not want to confirm Brender in office.
The opposition to the editor-in-chief was organized by Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He rejected further stays in the office of the highly respected editor-in-chief, arguing that under Brender, the quotas for monitoring the ZDF's news broadcast had fallen.
Until shortly before the election, there were therefore protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was sharply criticized.
Last time, 35 state law lawyers were even involved in the debate, who consider Koch’s procedure to be unconstitutional.
It was no use.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
He then worked for Südwestfunk and Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey moved to the ZDF, first to the "heute-journal".
Other stations: 1988 to 1990 personal referent of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; to 1998 head and moderator of "Morgenmagazins"; to 2001 head of foreign policy ZDF; since then head of the main studio ZDF.
After Brender, who was elected Journalist of the Year by Medium Magazine on Wednesday, was deposed, the Greens announced they were filing a constitutional suit.
Koch's counter-candidate on the board, Rhineland-Pfalz Prime Minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that the federal states should change the state treaty with the ZDF so that the intendant's staff proposals could not be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
But Beck also refused to exclude party politicians from the ZDF’s supervisory boards.
Brender's supposed successor Peter Frey gave the board a clever chess move - immediately after Brender's downfall, he strongly criticized the gremium for it.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, he could nominate him to the position of editor-in-chief without losing his face as Schächter, so he could be elected by the board of directors without suspecting that the party would be pushed into office.
In party arithmetic, Frey is no doubt classed as a leftist liberal.
Study Gets Rid of Harampady
Partial Success for Students: After a year of strikes, Culture Ministers finally arrived in the federal countries on Thursday: At the Conference of Culture Ministers and University Rectors, both sides agreed on the desire to improve the study conditions for bachelors and masters.
Students should be able to complete their studies in the future.
Specifically, they agreed to reduce the test load: In principle, each study module should be completed with a single test.
In addition, the workload of students should be reviewed, and a "real and defensible rate" should be guaranteed.
Politicians and colleges want to simplify the recognition of exams between colleges in Germany and abroad.
The federal states are committed to creating more flexible joint structural assignments for the bachelor and master fields of study.
Earth's deviations should cease to exist.
Less Exams
Since the start of the student protests in June, ministers of culture and university rectors have had winged words in their mouths about better study.
They are now for the first time filled with specific content.
The so-called Accreditation Council has decided that the number of exams will be reduced in part drastically: "Each module will usually be completed with only one exam", according to a 30-page report, which is partly intended to regulate the approval of the fields of study.
“Significantly lower test loads,” said Reinhold Grimm, chairman of the Accreditation Board, “are to be halted by a flawed development that has significantly reduced the study’s demands.”
To this end, the "demand of study" in the future should be a "decisive criterion" in the implementation.
Modules and content "must be hard-checked" to "necessarily restrict students in choosing
seminars."
Students should have “a claim to space that enables and supports their own initiative.”
The rules should apply when approving new fields of study, but also after review for existing fields of study.
These need to be “re-accredited” every five years – which means it will take until 2015 before all the fields of study are reviewed.
Ten accreditation agencies are responsible for this throughout Germany, which are subject to accreditation councils established by the federal states.
In October, the Culture Ministers called on the federal states "strongly" to act on the agencies so that the teaching load was not too high and the examination regime was not strict.
In individual federal states, universities and colleges have already agreed with the state ministries on appropriate measures.
As the only country to date, Rhineland-Palatinate has pledged additional funds for the further development of the Bologna Process.
From the money, universities should primarily pay for consulting programs and study advice, and strengthen the Examination and Foreign Offices.
For this, countries and universities want to spend ten million euros.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to submit a amendment to the university law to parliament.
According to her, only one test should be required to complete the study module.
The formation of the study should be even more flexible, in order to guarantee the recognition of examinations from other universities and to facilitate the access of the master.
By the end of next year, the demands of all fields of study in the country should be reviewed.
The government and the opposition on Thursday again discussed the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, criticism of the resolution also fell.
The Federal Board of Higher Education Groups called for education policymaking not to take place in the future "behind closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the strike, "at least a word should be said" by the students as the persons concerned.
Future academics also received support from the President of the Conference of University Rectors (HRK), Margreta Wintermantelova: "We need the experience of students," she said at a meeting with the Culture Ministers, with whom the HRK discussed a joint reform report.
According to the Departments of Education and Science (GEW), the Bonn resolutions did not go far enough: They require a legal claim that would allow any graduate with a bachelor’s degree to access a postgraduate master’s degree.
Secondly, the federal states must ensure that today’s generation of undergraduate students will have enough seats in master’s degree courses with the best possible study conditions tomorrow, said GEW Board Member Andreas Keller.
Federal states need to employ far more lecturers.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not express their views on free access to master’s programmes.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Getting to Germany and out is nice, almost no control..." is the opening line of a poem by the poet Werner Söllner, who in this torn language piece thematicizes the experience of the arrival of a dissident who gained freedom, but at the same time lost his language.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, working first as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and later as a lecturer at a children's book publishing house, then moved to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner was awarded various literary prizes, in 1993 he lectured poetry at the legendary Frankfurt Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been the leader of the Hessian Forum of Literature at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
A major out-of-state upheaval took place last Tuesday at a seminar in Munich that focused on "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the broken mirror of its security acts".
Apparently disfigured and infected, Söllner left a statement in front of fellow Romanian German writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmut Frauendorfer, confessing to co-operation as a secret informant of the Romanian secret service Securitate.
Together with some of the participants, Söllner won the German Language Prize in 1989.
Attempts to recruit began unnoticed, first in 1971.
"I am," continued Söllner, "someone who has not sufficiently resisted attempts at intimidation by Securitate."
The poet Werner Söllner is a secret agent Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the award of the Nobel Prize to Hertha Müller and her unparalleled literary dealings with the mechanisms of dictatorial government, the literary scene, and especially the community of German authors from Romania, is shaken by a case that denotes the depths and the shamefulness of the political system.
Werner Söllner is not, at least if it can be said according to the current state of knowledge, only the perpetrator, but he is also the victim.
In the Securitate Acts, Secret Agent Walter played a role, said after Söllner's confession Michael Markel, referring to the positive influence of Secret Agent Walter on himself.
"He cut me out" in all the essential points for him, says Markel.
It is his moral duty to make this comment.
Söllner’s statement in this form and in front of this audience was unexpected, but absolutely surprising, the confession of the former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not.
Herta Müller wrote back in July, when she read her own 914-page papers, that Germany was a pleasant reservation for the spicly Securitate.
Concerns can be assumed, they will speculate and in some cases probably know what name is hidden behind the cover name Sorin, Voice and just like Walter.
Unlike in the domestic, in the meantime a very certain review of the Stazi components, the manipulation of the remainder of the Securitate control is still very diffuse.
In recent years, systematic education has been marred and limited.
One of Birthler's offices, which corresponds to the National Council for the Processing of Securitate Components (CNSAS), was established only in 1999, the issuance of acts has been rather lengthy since then.
Only since 2005 has there been a law governing the management of components.
The fact that former members of Securitate still have a great influence in Romania, according to an interview with Herta Müller after the publication of the Nobel Prize, in which one of the former heads of Securitate from Timisoara expressed his rejection of the winner.
She says she's psychotic, after all, she's only been interrogated once.
The denunciation of power was expressed here completely uncovered in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, as with the Söllner case, there are inevitable questions, as with the silent plea.
The peculiar reaction of the listeners to Söllner's confession makes it to be expected that the continuation of this chapter will be determined rather by the desire for knowledge than by the acknowledgment of guilt and shame.
To the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, is more than a footnote.
Saturated Champions League deposit
It seemed as if a plain-clothed salesman came from a cute Christmas party at which the sports goods manufacturer was handing out sweets as he entered a quarter of an hour after midnight into the summoned Mercedes C-Class, accompanied by a new VfBr coach Christian Gross and an orange-coloured saxophone.
Because of him, a man with a marked baldness was allowed to drive around him in a foreign city.
Otherwise he could drive alone - alcohol was not in the game, and the 55-year-old man was also a little drunk.
It was a nice evening, but tomorrow it will continue to work.
Or it's just starting.
In the words of only three days of the engaged Swiss: "Surely we have reached the eight-finals", namely in the Champions League thanks to a 3:1 victory over Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not be blinded by success: it will be a brutally hard fight against descent."
"A far more important task" is ahead of us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat the performance from the royal class even on an ordinary league day.
And avoid the obvious weaknesses again after the three quick goals of Marica (5th), Träsche (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Drawing
The Champions League eight-finals (matches 16/17 + 23/24 February/ rematches 9/10 + 16/17 March) will take place on 18 December in Nyon.
Thus, the joy of Babbel’s successor’s simmering rise will remain.
Not only in the case of a supposed healer, who added to the uncertain Stuttgart professionals in a short period of time self-confidence, willingness to deploy and joy from the game.
I went to the players and told them to focus on their strengths and encouraged them to be braver, explained the soul healer Gross, who simply sounded like a successful recipe, but which, under the influence of the therapist Babbel, proved to be no longer effective.
Babbel's supporter Jens Lehmann said, "When a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that you wouldn't think possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a weeks break from injury, became the best player on the pitch due to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" detected by the proverbial "fresh wind" and working practices of the new boss: "He is a man who is radical and demanding.
That’s what we need in the current situation.”
Apparently, it was missing from Babbel.
VfB Stuttgart not yet saved, warns sports president Horst Heldt
But VfB Stuttgart needs more stability.
As a Gross, players and managers don’t want to overestimate the victory against the weakened replacement and completely overburdened defense of the Romanian guest.
They would have won in Glasgow before an ugly wake-up call came after a 0-4 defeat in Leverkusen, Khedira thinks.
And sports president Horst Heldt recalled that although one goal has been achieved in the season, the other is still a long way off.
We're not out of the water yet.
The fact that Heldt did not celebrate his 40th birthday even after his first home win in three months was due to weekend events that came to life in the form of a televised interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann just before the match began.
There are decisions that are made by others and not by Jens, Heldt responded to Lehmann’s harsh criticism.
He preceded the board with weak leadership and decided to change the coach after the pressure of pubertal fans.
Even the cancellation of his day off after the games, Lehmann labeled it as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and envy.
Lehmann’s statements “formulate pure egoism,” Heldt replied, announcing the consistency for the goalkeeper.
Both 40-year-olds will probably have no joy in life anymore.
In any case, they are in agreement with each other that without the work of the coaching team, such a strong and combative performance would not be possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a big share in the success," Heldt and Lehmann say unanimously - and the man with the needle bag agrees.
Category: Heavyweight World Championships competitions
Passionate duel in Bern: Challenger Kevin Johnson constantly provoked the words and gestures of world champion Vitalia Kli<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
However, after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his title in the heavyweight boxing organization WBC.
The arbitrators were unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains world heavyweight boxing champion.
The 38-year-old WBC champion defeated Kevin Johnson (120:108, 120:108, 119:109) unanimously on Saturday night in Bern.
For Kli<0xC4><0x8D>ka, this is the third successful defense of the title since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was twice World Champion by WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it didn’t happen to the o.k. that everyone expected.
Klitschko improved his balance to 39 wins in 41 professional matches, twice was defeated due to injuries.
The challenger Johnson was defeated for the first time in the 24th match.
In front of about 17,000 spectators in the Berne arena, Kli<0xC4><0x8D>ko drove a 2.02 meter high duel primarily with his left hand.
Eleven centimeters smaller Johnson, who announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, was withdrawing from the World Champion's blows, so Klitschko could not plant a decisive blow with his dangerous right hand.
Overall, passive Johnson did not do much for the challenger and only tried to get into other circles.
Kli<0xC4><0x8D>ka provoked with words and gestures, but his blows hit the world champion rarely.
But it is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who fought with Klitschko full twelve rounds.
Before the fight, the challenger took care of the upheaval in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as an "abhorrent zombie" who "can't do anything right".
During the weighing on Friday, the champion was provoked, he pulled Johnson's sunglasses out of his nose, "so he could see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Kli<0xC4><0x8D>ka's return
Kli<0xC4><0x8D>ko remained undefeated even after the fourth match after his return on 11 October 2008.
After a nearly four-year break, he defeated Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and took back "his" WBC belt, which he had to hand over without a fight.
This year, he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and Chris Arreol of the United States in September.
In this match I only got one shot and I was physically in good shape, Kli<0xC4><0x8D>ko justified a quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to defend all four important titles in the family.
Fr<0xC3><0xA1>r Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r is the world champion of WBO and IBF.
The WBA belt is worn by Brit David Haye, after he took the 2.13-metre-tall Nikolay Vulaev from the throne in November.
Haye canceled a match against Klitschko in the summer, which was scheduled for September.
His promoter company is reportedly planning a match against Klitschko at London's Wembley Stadium.
The Kunduz case
Front-line attack from the opposition: Green Party leader Jürgen Trittin has denounced Minister of Defense Guttenberg as a liar for misinformation about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and Linke (Left) are calling on the Chancellor to provide an explanation.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest information on the attack on the Kunduz, the opposition believes that Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has committed a deliberate deception.
The minister for the deadly bombing of two cisterns in September said "consciously false," Green Party leader Jürgen Trittin said in Saturday's ARD news program "Tagesschau".
Let's call it the usual expression: Lie.
The killing order was issued in violation of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the essence of the report NATO had, which Mr. Guttenberg read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it was revealed that the attack was not just about the destruction of the hijacked trucks, but about the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
The U.S. airstrike, demanded by German commander Kunduz Colonel Klein, killed or injured up to 142 people, according to a NATO investigation.
The Greens, the SPD and the Linke on Saturday called on Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately before the Bundestag and also clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the event.
Merkel has to explain whether the targeted killing strategy is part of the Afghan policy of the Bundestag – and whether the Chancellor’s Office, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service have endorsed this new strategy, called on Jürgen Trittin and Greens colleague Renate Künast.
The spokesman for the government, Ulrich Wilhelm, definitely rejected the criticism.
The Chancellor’s office has no influence on the specific deployment of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were also loud doubts about the ministry’s portrayal of the background to the release of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, the two informed Guttenberg correctly and completely about the background of the tanker attack.
Officially it was said that they should have denied the existence of NATO reports and silenced sensitive details to the minister.
However, it was reported from the vicinity of the two top officials that they had even alerted the Defense Ministry to several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein and one report by the military police.
"Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert should have asked in the meantime in a letter for clarification of the situation.
It is noted that he has not yet received an answer.
The ministry did not comment on the allegations on Saturday and pointed out that this will be dealt with in the investigative committee of the Bundestag, which will be established next Wednesday.
Worlds of Dreams
Some see images in their waking state and hear voices that others do not see and do not hear.
It is not only the mentally ill or drug-addicted that the boundaries between imagination and reality are blurred.
As long as it happens in sleep, everything is fine.
If we lie with our eyes closed in our dark room, we may be surrounded by the wildest fantasies and fantasy illusions.
But those who, in their waking dreams, see and hear things that others do not see and hear, in today’s Western world, are usually paid for as a fool or a drug addict, or at least as a stranger.
However, such images and voices do not arise only in the mentally ill or in a drug relationship.
Our imagination is at fault: The same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings, or write novels will, here and there, ensure that the boundaries between dream, imagination and reality are intertwined.
Dreams altered state of consciousness can occur in a variety of forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst delusion.
Although the initiator and effect may vary, Hildegard von Bingen’s visions, the drug experiences of the New-Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic states of delusions, psychosis, and hallucinations can be deduced from similar processes.
Hallucinations or visions will occur if the balance of the brain’s neuronal transmitters—mostly dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and acetylcholine—is spun off, and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often in schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over him.
The connection between delusion and sleep has employed philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of sleep in the waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, noted in 1861 the "great similarity of delusions with dream states", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "psychosis, with all nonsense, delusions, deception of the senses".
It's autumn of 2001, Henning T. turns into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and screamingly colorful.
Gravity has no power over it, it floats at the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him winged devil figures with bloody red grimaces, appreciating teeth.
They chase him, kick him in with heavy, fiery shoes, throw him against the wall, feel pain all over his body.
Loud, evil voices threaten from the walls and from the radio.
He can no longer stand the voices that hurt and insult him.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of the stereo, snatches them into the loop and fastens them to the hook on the ceiling.
He stands on one speaker and puts a loop around his neck.
Jumping.
The loop allows.
Teach yourself, shouting to the congregation, pulling his drums, "go to the clinic and let yourself be treated!"
Today, Henning T. is 40 years old, has experienced six acute psychoses, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
LSD was released.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective paranoid psychosis, in addition, he is manic-depressive, taking drugs against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, he is married for three years.
In psychosis, I experienced the worst fear and the deepest doubts, he says.
Ghosts are a terrible reality.
About one percent of people suffer from schizophrenia at least once in a lifetime, in psychiatric clinics it is the second most commonly treated disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, they can no longer distinguish the inner and outer world, they get into an overexcited state, which can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship illusions or the illusion of persecution.
Hearing of voices is particularly widespread - voices that command, comment, or conduct dialogues.
Even optical hallucinations are not uncommon.
The affected person is not able to distinguish important from unimportant, the brain cannot filter out disturbing signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like a dream, psychosis opens up a flood of thoughts and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, Chief Physician of the General Psychiatry Clinic of the University Clinic in Heidelberg.
Schizophrenic is at the center of events, everything has meaning directed at him.
At the same time, he gets into a passive role, becomes, like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot actively form them.
Schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
Comparison with reality is usually not possible with them, ghosts are a terrible reality, awakening is excluded.
Having a hallucination once in a lifetime
Unlike in a dream, Fuchss says, "but the sensory and spatial structure of the reality that one perceives in psychosis remains fundamentally preserved."
Blurred thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in a real framework.
Scientists are still puzzled as to why our brains are doing this kind of stuff.
Exceptional states can cause any person to lose their relationship to reality in the short term, says Fuchs.
Not everyone develops into psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists believe that the affected individuals have minimal brain damage.
We believe that in the early stages of development there will be damage to the neuronal maturation of the brain, for example, by the mother's viral disease during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
However, it remains a riddle as to how the neural system, which has not manifested itself in any way for many years, will malfunction.
The influences of the environment also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be the trigger of psychosis, if there is a disposition to it.
Also, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis because they interfere with the transmission system.
<0xE2><0x99><0xAA> When our brains are boiling <0xE2><0x99><0xAA>
It’s crazy that psychotronics suffer from their hallucinations, and to get rid of them, they swallow expensive drugs, others give money for drugs to get them, says psychology professor Erich Kasten from Lübeck.
Whether we perceive delusions as pleasant or unpleasant is often just a question of attitude.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and delusions for ten years, last year he interpreted his results in the book "Die unreale Welt in unserem Kopf" (The unreal world in our head).
Although hallucinations belong to the typical accompanying phenomena of psychoses, but also to surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline personality or depression, diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer’s or brain trauma are also common.
Surprisingly, it also hallucinates the brain of a healthy person under certain conditions.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of the contents of thoughts that are normally suppressed.
They arise when the parts of the brain in which sensory perception is processed are too active or under-suppressed; when our brain slows down, or when stimulation is lacking.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the removal of stimuli, stress, worries with love or other exceptional conditions.
In recent studies, up to one-third of respondents reported having hallucinated at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attending high school there.
Actually, she's a perfectly normal girl.
If it weren't for the shapes and the voices.
During breaks, she may be approached by a spinal cord with long, dark hair.
When she answers, her classmates look at her with surprise - no one but her sees and hears this boy.
This daring girl thinks of herself as a tenacious dreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't, she knows.
He wakes up, hears and sees the boy, just as he hears and sees the girl sitting next to him on the bench.
He can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, she likes the boy.
Am I crazy? he asks sometimes.
But he knows that this boy and other delusions are not real and will disappear again.
At night, the sights are rather daunting.
Frequently, delusions are a burden.
When she sits in class, she cannot watch the lesson many times, because the teacher in her eyes and ears is just presenting a new classmate, while he explains to everyone else audibly and visibly on the table of the mathematical equation.
At night, the appearances are rather depressing.
When she waits in her dark room for sleep, which comes rarely and too late, she often cannot tell whether she is awake or if she is already asleep, whether the images she sees, the grimaces, or the girl with bleeding cuts on her hands and feet arise in front of her open or behind her.
Leave me alone, she's yelling at the characters.
She doesn't tell her parents and friends about it, they'd think she'd gone crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She graduated last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Ever since she contacted Kasten on the internet, she knows she hasn't gone crazy.
Deception is also an art of desperation.
If someone is socially isolated or is deprived of stimuli, they are more likely to have hallucinations, Kasten says.
I think the brain doesn’t have enough work and takes care of its own fun.
Sarah K., the only child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13 that the man she had been calling her father from the time she was thinking was not her own father.
Because in visual and acoustic hallucinations, the same brain regions that also process real sensations and sounds are active, it is difficult for those affected like Sarah K. to distinguish delusion and reality from each other. "Every experience," says Kasten, "is played out in the brain, also reality is played out there.
Hallucinations are also images that allow the brain to form, which is why they act so realistically.”
Also, night dreams are evaluated by Kasten as a form of hallucination.
The hallucination of healthy people is not fundamentally different from the hallucination in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to identify their delusions as unrealistic.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to evaluate hallucinations as an extraordinary ability.
The Borderline Between Sleep and Hallucination
Unfortunately, in our world too focused on consciousness, the imaginary experience is mostly pathological, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and head of the Psychiatric and Psychotherapeutic Clinic at Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a serious, suffering disease, but it also brings positives, creativity - delusion is also an art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the so-called oneiroid form of experience, a special form of altered consciousness to dream.
Oneiroid states are highly complex, detailed fictional dreams that the person concerned considers to be real and cannot even distinguish them retrospectively from the waking state.
The oneiroid state of consciousness occurs in extreme situations caused by trauma or disease, for example, patients with polyradicular inflammation, who experience motor disease with full consciousness.
When a person is threatened by the loss of the world and himself, perhaps by a permanent, complete inability to move, he replaces a life threatening a real situation with his own imaginary world, which is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of borderline state between dreaming and hallucination.
Because in reality it is not possible to cope with a situation, the worlds will change, but the real situation will be present in the imagination.
An intense form of supporting the senses and translating the senses into some unbearable situation, which allows us to pass through our own ability to form in a moment into a loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in the memories
Also, art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" as a saving act of the soul.
He was 49 years old when, after heart valve surgery and subsequent heart transplantation, his consciousness was released on a several-day trip, his body lying motionless on an intensive care unit.
Claussen immersed himself in the world he created, visited foreign times and places: he becomes an old man tied to a bed, in a train sanatorium, a robot watches over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among the nobility, who produce narcotic substances from blood.
On a motorcycle, he is taken by a Greek to his homeland, on a hospital bed he surfs the firn in the Alps and meets a Korean mobster.
It is completely immersed in imaginary events, everything is real, even later in memories.
These inner paths are fundamentally different for Clausen from any dream.
A dream is a different state, it describes its experience.
Contrary to dreams, the memories of those mental journeys are still clear after years and in trivial details.
Even brighter and more intense than the actual experience.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other true experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
After all, oneiroid states, psychoses, hallucinations and drug entanglements show how fragile even in the waking state our inner images of external realities are.
Any change in the state of consciousness, sums up psychologist Kasten, "can lead to the deformation of what we call reality."
A fact that can also be enriching.
The snow can come
Burda
At 27, the children will take over the publishing house.
The new head of Kallen is a transitional solution: Hubert Burda wants to hand over his business to his two children in the long run, he told SPIEGEL.
In the future, the company will be 100% family owned.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda sees his business long-term in the hands of his children.
Both children will inherit at the age of 27 and have a strong will to enter the business, says a 69-year-old man to SPIEGEL.
We dealt with the details carefully.
The question of whether they are also active in the company is only then asked.
The question is whether they have the ability to do so.
It is not possible to put your children in charge of 7,500 employees if they are not sufficiently capable.
That would kill both the kids and the company.
Burda announced on Thursday that he was stepping down from the board of directors since January, and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
52-year-old Kallen has been a board member at Burdy since 1999.
He was in charge of technology first.
Later, with the Department of the Treasury, responsibility for the company's assets was added and after the resignation of Jürgen Todenhöfer also Direct Marketing, Foreigners, Printing and Finance.
For the first time, none of the members of the family are at the head of the publishing house.
Burd's children are 19 and 17 years old, and his son Felix, who would have been 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also serves to "speak 10, 15 years," Burda said.
In the future, the holding should belong to a 100% family, Burda says.
Regarding the Schickedanz and Schaeffler cases, Burda said that even family businesses are not sure of their demise: "It has always affected companies that have been infected by the desire for capital, that have speculated and thought that they can become great players.
That was never my strategy.
He never had “dreams of world power,” Burda says.
I don't see myself as the political preceptor of this country, like Springer, and I don't want to play the world league with "Time," these shops are too big.
Comprehensive care of beauty
Everything you can wish for in the area of beauty and well-being is at your fingertips.
This was the intention of El Corte Inglés, which has just started the operation of the Callao (Madrid) shopping center with an area of more than 1000 m2, in which various services in the field of body care are provided.
The wellness department is located on the eighth floor, home to such prestigious companies as Hedonai dealing with laser hair removal-; Spaxi<0xC3><0xB3>n, relaxation areas and aesthetic procedures; Luis & Tachi peluqueros; Marina d'Or with a gym orL'Occitane offering natural cosmetics, and more.
There is also a department for nutrition and mainly a tea room offering more than 130 different types of tea.
You can also enjoy relaxing massages with your partner while enjoying the view of the capital, you can rent a relaxation zone for two hours and arrange your own 'beauty party' in the company of up to eight friends, relax in the hot tub, get a massage and a glass of champagne, which are some of the options
This is a total of 250 m2 in the form of 12 salons, in which the above services are provided, as well as state-of-the-art procedures for face, body and also hydrotherapy.
As an example, we can mention cavitation, which is used in the fight against cellulite, or vibration platform.
The gym is also equipped with these machines, in addition to virtual trainers, who supervise the individual actions of clients and thus provide completely individual care.
It all starts by inserting a personal key into the contact display, which is placed against the machine.
Then you can watch the video demonstrations that will show you the correct implementation of our training team.
Your instructor guarantees that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching) is enough to train all the muscles.
And if after the exercise we have a desire to go to the hairdressing salon, Luis & Tachi has a space where individual procedures are carried out to heal the hair, improve its shine and nutrition.
Innovation and exceptionality are the hallmarks of this city wellness centre, which is open every day from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.
Varied necklines
Christmas is approaching and this is the time to find out what celebrities wear, and to customize your festive wardrobe.
The shape of the cut is very important to highlight the character, which is necessary to keep in mind.
We make a few suggestions.
Singer Fergie chose an extravagant and very complicated cut. Not recommended.
Endesa in Barcelona, with electric car
The energy company Endesa, together with the Barcelona City Hall, founded 'Kanzler<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> LIVE'.
This is a project for the development and promotion of an electric car in the capital of Catalonia.
The LIVE Office (Logistics for the introduction of electric cars) will establish and manage a roadmap for the introduction of electric cars in the city and ensure agreements in the field of mobility, will handle, coordinate and submit contributions, etc.
It will also develop the MOVELE project, promote electric vehicles, collect opinions and results of activities in the sectors involved.
Overall, the aim is to promote this means of transport of the future.
3 'Electric Cities'
However, Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the project to introduce electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Seville will also join the project.
These are three cities chosen by the government under the MOVELE Plan to support the introduction of electric cars.
The energy company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Catalan government.
The aim is to support research and technological development activities in the Catalan Autonomous Region.
This includes activities related to energy and, above all, energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative with Endea’s participation in the promotion of electric cars.
The company is represented in the European standardization teams and actively implements a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero predicts a 'quiet period' in the automotive industry.
Prime Minister José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero predicts that the Spanish automotive industry, the main export sector of the state, is waiting for a "quiet period".
In the 2009 economic report of the Prime Minister, Zapatero summarized the measures introduced during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without a Competitive Plan for the automotive sector, we would be in a state of abandonment, the closure of some of our major manufacturing companies," he said.
"Thanks to this plan and the desire of the individual brands to continue to operate in Spain in this highly competitive sector, a certain period of calm is expected in the future for this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this sense, he pointed out that the competition plan, which forms part of the Integrated Automotive Plan (PIA), allocated 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies that mobilized an investment of more than 3 billion euros.
The Prime Minister explained that this investment is intended for the development of new models, for the modernization of production and existing processes.
Zapatero also stressed the government’s support for the claim and referred to the 2000E plan, which is being implemented in cooperation with the Autonomous Regions and car brands.
According to the president, this plan allowed to reduce the average emission level of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market by 6%, and ensured a "significant increase" in registrations, specifically in November by "40 percent".
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first International Salon of Classic Vehicles will open in Madrid, a meeting place for professionals and amateurs from the world of motoring.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the glass pavilion of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters, which will be represented by more than 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors.
Here you will find not only classic motorcycles and cars, but at ClassicAuto Madrid there will also be products of all kinds related to the world of motorbikes.
Exhibitors in the pavilion will offer accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of products related to classic engines, real treats for collectors and enthusiasts.
Among the participating companies will be: Cl<0xC3><0xA1>sicos de Mos and Good Old Times, sale of cars; Juan Lumbreras, renovation; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, sale and renewal of cars; or Cochera Cl<0xC3><0xA1>sicos, specialized company Mercedes Benz.
Exterior proficiency tests
In addition, the commercial activity of this salon will be complemented by parallel activities: the holding of concentration, sports performances, probationary capacity, presentations and competitions.
Eligibility tests for classic cars and motorcycles will also be carried out in an adapted circuit outside the exhibition zone.
Mazda3 i-Stop: maintaining sporty style
Mazda intends to show that environmental friendliness has no negative impact on the sporting style.
And that’s why the Mazda3 also has a built-in engine stop and start system – also referred to as a-Stop-, which is a device currently only available with a 2.0-horsepower petrol engine.
This second generation Mazda3 is characterized by good characteristics that it has achieved as a whole.
Surface treatment, vehicle design, habitability, behaviour, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All of these aspects are excellent with Mazda3.
The front seats, including the driver’s seat, have excellent ergonomics and are perfectly fixed.
The steering wheel is also extremely soft.
Using a set of tools and a console, we conclude that Mazda continues the Japanese trend in developing a futuristic design with many buttons and drivers and a distinctive red and blue color.
This style partly reminds us of the style that also presents the Honda Civic.
So we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products and, in particular, even more with the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to defeat.
As usual, this Japanese compact product offers more than enough space for four adults who want a very comfortable ride.
In addition, it is necessary to mention a large luggage space and regular shapes.
The automatic engine stop and start system is currently only available with a two-liter petrol engine and 150 horsepower with a six-speed manual transmission.
This engine is a real treat. It is very gentle, characterized by reduced noise level, its power and lower consumption.
Although the most sought-after Mazda3 is in the diesel version, all those who do not drive as many kilometers per year should not rule out this i-Stop with a gasoline engine, as it is characterized by greater driving comfort and reduced fuel consumption.
As for the equipment, the version selected for testing is called Sportive and includes a larger number of serial elements.
In the case of serial equipment, it is necessary to mention in particular the lane tracking system (RVM) 17, which prevents the formation of a dead angle, control of thrust and stability, speed control, internal light-sensitive mirror, on-board computer with large screen, parking sensors, separate air conditioning and sensors.
And if the equipment was not enough, this version was equipped withPack Premium, for an extra charge of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 1,500: adaptive dual-xenon lights and the BOSE sound system with CD holder, among other components.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars in its class.
It is mainly characterized by the quality of the materials used, its operation and high level of equipment.
In addition, people who do not drive more kilometers per year can choose this version of i-Stop, which is only with a 2.0 petrol engine and 150 hp.
The only drawback of this model is its higher price, which is 21,770 euros for the Luxury version and 23,270 euros for the tested version -Sportive-.
At this high price, Mazda3 offers us a great dose of satisfaction for every day.
Luxury 'Premier'
L.A. has a red carpet, as soft as the hands of Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars dazzled more than ever before in the new elegant and sexy models of the brand'Nine'. (Photo: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', extravagant as usual, chose the dark 'lady'.
Slib FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, used only to view mail, without the ability to view a certain type of attachments or surf the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the US when Time magazine praised him as one of the products of the year.
Seeing it outside is harder, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek is characterized by a very low price and monthly payments, less than half the amount that is paid for an iPhone data plan, for example.
After its success, the company began to offer two new devices: one is intended exclusively for Twitter, the other on the basis of permanently provided free data services, for which it is necessary to pay for Peek six times the amount.
FonPeek, which was unveiled yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and at the same time its third transformation.
It is limited just like its American counterpart, but brings surprises.
The monthly cost for maintenance is about 12 euros per month and includes roaming throughout Europe.
People traveling with a smartphone already know what it means to miss out on data services after crossing borders or impatiently look for a cafe with WiFi (or a Fon connection) so they can view their mail.
The idea with a rooming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced a long time ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but in my experience one would need a doctorate in physics to understand them, and also very good glasses to be able to read miniature letters.
The European Commission is constantly demanding that roaming tariffs be reduced so that they are accessible to the whole of Europe, which still does not have the desired effect.
There are reasonable concerns about the use of data services outside the home state.
The fact that such a device as FonPeek (interestingly, it still has the name Fon when it does not have WiFi) reaches this type of tariff means that operators start to think differently and consider different offers to compensate for their data network.
Kindle is another nice example, offering book downloads and other Internet searches.
No contracts, no complications.
This device is connected and pays when purchased, not after months.
And that's exactly what I expect to happen one day in the case ofFonPeek, it's a possibility of buying with a permanent approach as it Peek has already introduced in the US.
Not because I want to buy it.
I'm looking at the mail on the phone, thank you.
I expect this because I think it is the best type from the consumer point of view.
It would be interesting if the same system could be used on a computer.
The color that Michelle adores
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the first lady of the United States.
For Barack Obama, she chose the dress and coat in this color, and she chose the same color when she accompanied him at the second most important moment of his life: the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: in addition to being a similar color - yellow-green with shiny effects - in both cases it was a three-piece set - a dress, a bag and a coat of the same fabric - decorated with a large embroidery or collar.
At first glance, it seemed that the first lady of the United States decided to follow in the footsteps of the Asturian princess and wear similar clothes.
The fabric from which the clothes are made makes both models significantly different.
On the occasion of entering the position Michelle used a large lace, in Oslo velvet with a print.
Also changing accessories: green shoes with a medium high heel, nowa similar model, but in gold color.
She also wears different hairstyles: this timebrown, previously dissolved hair.
75% of working mothers have work-related problems related to motherhood.
Discrimination in employment has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who are planning to have a child.
This is the result of a study 'Fertility and the working career of Spanish women', conducted by CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The study involved 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 years and the results are clear: 75% of working mothers have limited opportunities in the labor market due to maternity.
The study highlights that at the beginning of the partnership, there are many differences in views on the number of children, depending on whether they work or not, and also by type of employment.
Women who do not work outside the home, work part-time or do not have a stable job, start living with a partner earlier, have their first child earlier and have more children overall.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, delay coexistence and maternity, and have fewer offspring.
"Women aged 35 to 49 with stable employment have their first child on average 3.7 years from the start of cohabitation with a partner. This figure is 4.1 for women who have devoted most of their lives to achieving their stable employment and therefore had to postpone cohabitation and the arrival of children.
The type of profession also has a strong influence on motherhood, although it has a minor influence on the time of starting cohabitation with a partner," explains Margarita Delgado, who is researching at CSIC.
Another factor influencing the age of women at the time of marriage is the degree of education.
Research shows that the higher the level of education, the higher the age at which women marry and have their first child.
There are also differences between women of the same generation.
For example, in the age group of 35 to 49 years, women with primary and higher education gave birth to their first child at the age of 25.1 and 32.1 respectively.
"There is another difference between women depending on their level of education.
Women with basic education marry and give birth to their first child before they find a stable job, while women with secondary or higher education progress on the contrary prefer to get a stable job, before getting married and giving birth to their first child," says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L’Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its prestigious list of representatives: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will be the face of various products of this brand under the universal slogan 'Because I am worth it'.
'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actresses on the international stage, joins other celebrities such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish actress Penélope Cruz.
Before her, actresses Evangeline Lilly (‘Lost’) and Freida Pinto (‘Millionaire from the hut’) joined the club.
The men's section of this cosmetics brand is also represented by prominent personalities: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's partner in 'The Lost').
Prices of British Fashion
The British have a lot to say about fashion.
Their most important representatives - designers and models, formerly and now - met at the annual awards ceremony held in London, at the Royal Court os Justice.
No one was missing at the meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger were named Best Model of the Year.
Poker Manuel Vicente
Manuel Vicente donates in 'Ace Poker' (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) thirty x-rays of the writers he met in his literary life (and in some cases in his ordinary life).
He does not do so in feared and predictable genres (biographical similarity, life and work), but rather seeks something similar to the core of a creative personality.
The journey brings excitement and Vicent spares neither relief nor inspiration.
This book is an excellent book for readers to enjoy, even if they read it repeatedly.
Here are some observations.
On the pages of this book, I have found that the Mediterranean is not the sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, the same as what I feel, but it cannot be named: the enjoyment of anti-judgment, morality without guilt, and innocence without any god.
“A nihilist, an allegorical Christian, wrote according to his own nature and not intellect, something between helplessness and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humor, meaningless, as if it were the blade of a knife that almost killed him.”
Graham Green: "Our man has been diluted with passion for this woman for thirteen years, adultery, pleasure and remorse, which is a spiritual privilege to reach heaven by the way of damnation."
About James Joyce: "This Odyssey was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand peaks in universal literature that must be overcome from the north side, from which the best climbers often collapse."
William Faulkner: "He was a strange man.
He said of himself that he was the heir to the landlord of the county, and again that he was the son of a black woman with a crocodile.
In both cases, it was a big dream.”
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer caught on the bridge the insane cry of this man from Munich to bring his echo to the night of the 20th century in his literary form, fleeing before himself and calling to the future and speaking loudly to the worms."
Dorothy Parker: "One time she knelt down and prayed, 'My God, my beloved, tell me to stop writing like a woman.'"
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were engraved Spencer's verses: 'After the effort comes a dream,/after the storm a calm harbor,/after the war a rest,/after a full life death.'"
About Virginia Wolf: "He also carried his depression in his luggage.
Her husband completely agreed to tell her that Edward VII was watching her among the Azalkas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
No man has ever been so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent goes hand in hand with madness.
About P<0xC3><0xAD>o Baroja: "What else did Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n Santos do than focus Joyce on Baroja?
What else did Bennett have to do with Baroya executing Faulkner's weapon?
What was it that made Cel famous at the expense of that man’s glory?”
Cowardly Aggression
Last week my seventy-year-old mother was walking through our neighborhood, in the district of Fuenlabrada, and a group of young people aged 15 to 18 passed by and our dog, a crossbred rescued from a shelter weighing no more than six kilograms, was kicked twice without a single word and severely injured.
Our outrage is all the greater that we see nothing amusing in such an aggression against a small and defenseless animal that was also on the line.
And besides, the shock of the old lady after this incident, when she encountered these individuals on the walk, she began to fear for her own safety, for such a demon-possessed man, who attacks an animal, is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old man, or anyone who is weaker than he is.
It happened at five o'clock in the afternoon, on Tuesday, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
We have, of course, lodged a complaint with the nearest commissioner, but we doubt that this was helpful, and in order not to raise sensitive questions, we note that these cowardly murderers were of Spanish nationality.
Anger prompted us to announce this fact.
We don’t understand what happens to today’s youth when they are having fun worrying about a defenseless animal that gives us love, companionship, and friendship.
We do not understand where the right education, respect for animals and people has gone.
Michelin and Fesvial together for wearing helmets
The Michelin tyre manufacturer, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), launched a campaign to promote helmet use, especially for younger motorists, as both entities have reported today.
The purpose of this initiative is to emphasise the importance of wearing a helmet, as it is the only means by which head injuries or even deaths in the event of a motorcycle accident can be prevented.
Michelin says this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which “means more than designing and manufacturing even safer products”, and has confirmed that it is also trying to achieve this goal in other ways, i.e. through an instructional and information campaign.
This new campaign to promote the use of a helmet when riding a motorcycle, under the slogan 'To be or not to be', is the first phase when signs will be placed in more than 500 repaired motorcycles to bring them to the attention of the widest public.
In conclusion, Michelin noted that road safety "is a constant problem" of the company, which is a manufacturer of two-wheeled tires and whose main goal is to constantly increase product safety.
Sales of light commercial vehicles are on the rise
After almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles is beginning to recover.
All 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November saw an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and what’s more, this is the first increase after 22 months of permanent decline, according to figures from the patronage organization of manufacturers Anfac and dealers Ganvam.
However, a favourable figure is better to quarantine, as November 2008 is a very bad period for comparison and meant a 60% reduction compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the increase in the last month, the total number of vehicles registered in the last 11 months is 40% less than in the previous accounting year.
Since January, 95,853 vehicles have been sold, which includes all possible vehicles belonging to the category of light commercial vehicles: passenger car derivatives, pick-ups, vans, smaller trucks and light trucks / chassis.
And the clouds that hurt demand the most did not disappear, even though they were bought by private individuals, most of the purchases were made by small and medium-sized companies, and in 100% of cases this is financing through third parties.
Other factors, such as the cessation of activity or the continuation of a bad economic situation, should be added to the restrictions resulting from the closure of a source of bank loans.
In this situation, unlike passenger cars, the support for the purchase of the 2000E did not help much.
In addition to private individuals, it is necessary to mention those entrepreneurs on the business card of small and medium-sized companies who intend to buy a light commercial vehicle up to 3.5 tons with a CO2 emission level of not more than 160 grams per kilometer, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday from Ganvam they again reminded that special attention should be paid to the management of these vehicles as well as industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The sellers’ association predicts that in 2010 the trend will be similar to last year and according to calculations, sales of passenger cars and 4x4s will decrease by 19%.
The auxiliary system for the manual brake is already a mandatory equipment.
As in the case of the ABS anti-lock system, with ESP stability control, auxiliary handbrake systems, all this will become the mandatory equipment of European cars.
In fact, it is already part of the mandatory equipment of all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the others a deadline is set for eliminating the deficiency, which is February 2011.
The measure introduced in the EU aims to increase the protection of pedestrians, while working in a way that can help prevent many collisions.
The auxiliary handbrake system increases the pressure on the brakes in an emergency, which the system detects after the driver has stepped down.
But he can’t always hold that pressure to the end.
According to a study carried out by the auto parts manufacturer Bosch, a third of drivers who have an accident did not get off the brakes before the crash, and half of them did not use the full force of the brakes.
Up to 1,100 accidents
Conversely, this assistance requires the braking system to the maximum, shortening the braking distance of the vehicle.
According to a study carried out in the EU itself, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of equipment, up to 1,100 pedestrian-related fatalities could be prevented annually.
Reducing this number will be even more marked—according to calculations, it would prevent one in four accidents with an impact on people—after the introduction of so-called smart handbrake systems.
In this case, vehicles will be equipped with a system that (using radar or cameras) captures obstacles and reports them to the driver, except for light braking.
If the driver reacts, it will help him to increase the pressure on the pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not react, even if the collision cannot be prevented, the device will impact the brake as intensely as possible and reduce the risk of damage to a minimum.
General Motors postpones plans for Opel until January
Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, told Opel employees in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April - probably April 8 - as reported by Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer warns that more time will be needed to meet the recovery plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is trying to get every point of the plan agreed with the party concerned first.
And as a result, it may happen that the final document, which will be presented first to the employees and then to the governments of the individual countries in which the production facilities are located, will be issued late in early 2010.
GM, on the other hand, assures that the decision to sell Saab should be taken in these days.
No wonder the Swedish government has increased pressure on the U.S. manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM allows contacts with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also wants to acquire Volvo, but is considering the possibility of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, which operates under the auspices of the Russian group Converg.
In the event that it is not possible to reach an agreement with any of them, GM could sell some of the Saab assets to Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year remains valid if it fails to sell.
Driving with the Porsche Boxster Spyder
In the development of this magnificent model, Porsche engineers used the Boxster S as the basis and managed to reduce the weight by 80 kg, so the weight shows only 1,275 kg.
On the basis, in the first place, the automatic pull-down roof is in a woven version with hand-operated rims 19 kg, so that the additional weight was reduced by 21 kg; furthermore, aluminum doors such as GT3 were used, which means another 15 kg less; removal of air conditioning, 13; reduction of the fuel tank by 64 kg.
And finally, removing the CDR-30 audio system means another six kilograms less and replacing the door handles with textile handles means another kilogram.
Also available with a dual-clutch PDK transmission, a single vehicle with a manually operated six-speed gearbox has been tested, mainly on second-class roads in California, on mountain sections with many twisty corners.
His behavior can only be qualified as inviolable.
The weight reduction does not mean that the vehicle is not pressed to the asphalt.
Quite the opposite: we have not tested such a small and lightweight model in a long time, which at the same time would convey such safety when moving in a corner, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete able to warm up the muscles while driving for a short time until we order him to sprint, brake, and resume the use of the engine...
Whatever we want. Thanks to the steering, which is as communicative as it is accurate, whatever we suggest with our hands on the steering wheel, is what the car will do.
And he'll do it with surgical precision.
The sound of the engine according to your will
The sound of the V6 boxer, about 320 horsepower (about 10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and can be enhanced with the option of 'sport' and through a system that modifies the sound of the engine, which was previously used in the Panamera.
The capacity of acceleration is brutal, whether during suction or recuperation.
The curtains are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we pass with the Boxster Spyder was pretty badly damaged, but the car did well with the mudslides.
Electronic support was almost unnecessary during the drive; and in some corners we ran into the dawn of frost and gravel even in the early morning.
Definitely this ultra-light car is one of the funniest on the market, as it is a little more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010 for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70,831.
"Bag girl"
A friend of Karl Lagerfeld, an icon of the Coco Cocoon series and an occasional 'starlette' at 'firm' shows, the singer shows her face to an evil girl as vehemently as her Chanel handbags.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's 'Bag Girl'.
Baskonia wins in Israel
The box office won a brilliant victory in 82-91 in its hosting on the complicated Maccabi Electra course, despite numerous absences in the Duska Ivanovice team, and thus got to the top of their group after the big performance of Mirza Teletovice, who was declared with the best score of eight three-pointers.
The Vitoria Society was able to replace the significant absence of Hermann, Oleson, Huertase or Mic with a large dose of dedication and collective work, although it had to suffer to the end to win the victory.
In addition, the high accuracy from the circuit with 16 triple points contributed a lot to the final triumph.
The match started with a front for the blues, who from the beginning stood on the mark.
That the first four baskets for Vitoria were from a distance already indicated that they had attacked the Israeli team very hard.
English and Teletovic were among the main shooters 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was similar, but the Alavian team decided on the inner game of Baraca and the work of Eliyahu, who was accepted by whistling and applauding on his return to his original post to increase the advantage before the start of the break (34-43).
Teletovic has already started to show himself as the best in his team with 13 points, although "without six" in Splitter's assessment already indicated that it would not be the best night for the Brazilians.
But even though the match was sharp until the break, it was not decided in the slightest, and the Macabees wanted to remind Vitoria that not everyone wins on their pitch, and 'the hand of Elias' was able to win.
Eidson and Pnini definitely contributed to the 'yellows' returning to prominence (50-49).
More inappropriate
The members of Ivanovic, wounded but not dead at all, needed a few precise games to catch their breath, and then the machine gun Mirza Teletovic appeared, which, with the help of English and Ribase, returned the scores to a calming number (54-67), which reached the locals at the end of the third quarter.
The Alavians had their skin in the last part and English and San Emeterio (60-75) have already announced that they will not be allowed to be deprived of the well-deserved results of the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not give up and tried to keep the team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter excluded behind the foul, Ivanovic did not rush and defended well, and although the Israelis approached the final minute (80-85), the match had already won and Tel Aviv lost for the first time in the season.
Injuries prevent Unicaja from fighting
Unicaja lost significantly in Greece to Olympiacos, leaving him to lead Group B in the Euroleague match, which was marked by three attacks by Unicaja, but mainly an internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga Society did not indulge in the pavilion of peace and friendship or rivalry, perhaps one of the sickest in Europe, and with a large budget.
The game in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. Aggressive defense and three triple points in a row, two thanks to Omar Cook and one thanks to Guillem Rubio, illuminated the pitch s12-18, minute 9.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, although the locals' arsenal in the indoor game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned the score 22–20, the 13th minute, which was the moment when the battle between the USABeverley and Williams supports meant the exclusion of both players.
The Greek team began to operate and proved its dominance in both zones, where the absence of an English pivot due to the injury of Joel Freeland and three personal mistakes of Carlos Jiménez burdened the Unicaja team.
Between the domestic players and the Lithuanian wing Linas Kleizas with three points increased the advantage to 44-32, minute 19.
Impossible Revenge
The third part was very aggressive by Olympiacos, who, despite losing by 19, showed dominance and even managed to equalize the difference from the match in M<0xC3><0xA1>laga M<0xC3><0xA1>laga 66-48, the 27th minute, which shook the leadership of the group.
Unicaja tried to overcome the absence and last absence of Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, who was injured in the last match.
Despite all of Unica's drawbacks, thanks to Cook's lead and triple points and Lewis's advantage, she left some hope of a 66-57 win, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible, because Olympiacos, thanks to its strength and dominance in centimeters in its zone, proved that it is unstoppable.
Croatian midfielder Nikola Vujcic, managed to equalize the basketball average 81-62, minute 37, and Unicaja slipped and handed the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you collect for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can get to know the salary they deserve for their profile, thanks to the new Trovit app, the search engine with the largest number of classified ads from real estate, jobs and motor vehicles in Spain.
The tool How much should you take? calculates the salaries of users based on more than 140,000 job offers that Trovit has available in Spain, using the form available on Facebook, where you need to put the profession, years of experience, age and the city where the interested party wants to work.
Within a week of the app working, the search engine found that the Spanish worker was generally “feeling poorly paid,” Albert Rivera, responsible for the Trovit product, explained in his report.
According to the data he has available to find from his search engines in the UK and France, Spaniards are the worst paid.
The British programmer takes <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>45,226 gross per year and the French <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>31,059 gross per year, while the Spanish gets <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>24,000.
Similarly, the driver has a net salary of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>34,247 per year in England, <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>25,751 in France and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst-paid job in Spain is a waiter with 11,592 euros net per year; followed by a salesman with 14,725 euros and a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most searched jobs on the network in the last three months are a driver, a part-time job and a social worker.
Brazil sets a date for Zelayo's departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya to stay at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President-elect must leave the diplomatic mission no later than January 27, 2010, when his term officially ends.
Francisco Catunda, chargé d’affaires of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that by this date he must leave the embassy, where he has been hiding since September 21.
"He is aware that on January 27, after the end of his term, he must leave and seek another refuge."
The station also quoted a former statesman who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the auspices of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by phone.
After the November 29 elections (when Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain at the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, that same week he tried to get refuge in Brazil.
The operation ultimately failed because Zelaya refused the political asylum condition that the de facto government headed by Roberto Micheletti had sought to impose on him.
Thank you.
After the days of wine and roses since last spring, when asset inflation was the predominant mood in the markets, uncertainty has resurfaced in the markets, which should not be surprising, as it is already a natural state in an environment where executives make decisions about a future that is uncertain in itself.
The drug used by central banks to stabilise the market was the redemption of debt by direct purchase of assets and the indirect release of liquidity at a rate close to zero so that financial institutions could purchase assets for deduction.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases are practically over, and without questioning their inconsistent liquidity policy, they are beginning to throw some sand into the tide, as the Spanish Central Bank did with its auction last year.
Investors therefore doubt the ability of the world economy to sustain economic recovery without such heterodox measures, and we are taking part in the return of reducing risky returns.
The volatility of the stock market and the debt gaps of the companies have again gained points, although they are still very far from the abnormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk, which again affected public debt.
Once again, there is pressure on quality, and the US, Japan and Germany have become a haven of choice for investors, thus widening the differentiation between the euro area and Germany.
Spain was almost unaffected by this instability, but at that time Standard & Poor's came and threatened a new revision of the Kingdom's qualifications.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not useless to silence advocates of moral risk, who have again tried to burden the consciences of those responsible for world economic policy because of the slowing down of the devastating consequences of limiting credit to employment, when in fact a new day would have to be declared.
However, the situation in Dubai represents a tribal struggle between the emirates for the restoration of power in the emirates, and as far as Greece is concerned, we have seen this before.
A government that covers the deficit, elections and a new government is coming.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and S<0xC3><0xB3>crates in Portugal after Dur<0xC3><0xA3>o Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from defaulting on foreign payments at the beginning of the year and to allow the euro member country to default on its commitments.
What makes sense, however, is for Ecofin to force the Greek government to be transparent and to commit its own citizens to joint responsibility when emergency measures are needed to maintain the stability of their public finances.
If, as we expect, we are ahead of the period of normalisation of the transitional risk premiums, after some excesses on supported positions they would be within expectations.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in public debt will increase as will the debts of European companies, we need not worry.
If Europe's disparities are reduced and ours continue to expand, it would be a typical Spanish risk.
The Standard & Poor's issue is just an anecdote. When our leading indicators force most of the study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and revise their 2011 recovery scenario, including the OECD and the European Commission, to return to this Japanese scenario, for the Spanish economy, it does not tell the big news.
Again, it looks like it will be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, albeit "carefully, chauffeur friend" for the time being.

President Iberdrola Ignacio S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n was the first to speak before the subcommittee of the Chamber of Deputies, where he is currently discussing Spain's energy strategy for the next two decades.
After his speech, followed by a speech by President Gas Natural-Fenos, Rafael Villasecy, Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n made several comments to the press on the proposal, which he submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to President Iberdrola, Spain needs an investment of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 billion by 2020 and another <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion from this date until 2030, if nuclear power plants that are currently in operation remain.
If this is not the case, the required investment will not be $60 billion, but up to $95 billion.
Iberdrola believes that in the next decade, investments must focus not on increasing production capacity, but on distribution networks and international connections.
From 2020 onwards, the issue will change and performance will need to be improved.
Its offer focuses on gas and coal-fired power plants with carbon capture mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this case, it believes that a new 18,000 MW is needed, but with other "supportive energies".
Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n, who believes the bill on a sustainable economy just approved by the government, corresponds to the line the company demanded, did not want to let go as a royal decree to promote the consumption of national coal, which contradicts the policies of the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, the "clear long-term bet" is in this sense, despite the "precise" measures, as President Iberdrola called them.
Whatever the case may be, Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n believes that investment decisions, although long-term, must begin to be made right now, as their maturation takes time and a stable tax framework is needed to start them.
Ferrovial wins 'handling' Aer Lingus at 10 airports
Ferrovial’s subsidiary for airport ground services, Swissport, will play the role of preferred partner of Irish airlines Aer Lingus for freight services at ten European airports, where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important of them.
The agreement, which has not yet resulted in economic deadlines, is valid for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, Junta Castilia-La Mancha and the University of Alcal<0xC3><0xA1> de Henares signed yesterday a protocol on cooperation to create the Center for Innovation of Smart Infrastructures
The association anticipates an investment of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% belongs to Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be energy efficiency research on highways and airports.
Acciona seeks its first motorway in Australia against Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first concession on a motorway in Australia, a market where it already operates as an energy and water company.
The tunnel is estimated to be worth 1.7 billion Australian dollars (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.047 million).
Its rivals are the French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief.
The 5-kilometre-long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast has become the closest option for Acciona to settle in the country as a construction and concession highway company.
The city council wants the tunnel to be completed by the end of 2014
After selecting public-private cooperation (PPP according to initials in English) for the further development of the project in the business plan protected by Erns & Young, the administration already has a final list of candidates for the implementation of the construction and operation of the toll.
The bids are expected to be submitted in May, with the projected investment reaching 1,700 million Australian dollars (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,047 million) and in the final phase of the competition three groups with a significant presence in European buildings.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of Australia’s largest construction companies and the second, based in Italy, is one of Europe’s largest underground construction specialists.
The game is played against Acciona by Northern Direct with the presence of British Laing O'Rourke, Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last group to cross the network is called LBRJV and is owned by the Australian capital Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, here represented by ACS), as well as the local Bauderstone (owned by the German Bilfinger Berger Group) and a major company specialising in civil construction.
The Australian infrastructure market promises major construction and privatization, but it carries with it a clear difficulty of entry other than through the mediation of the acquisition of a local construction company.
The strategy followed by the mentioned Hochtief or Bilfinger is, in addition to Asian references, still an example for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS acquired a market position through its 30 % stake in Hochtief, the owner of Leighton.
Millions of assets
Acciona bets on the geographical area of greatest importance for a given sector, where it already has a significant presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination trade.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm in Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria and manages a group of companies that build and manage desalination facilities in Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
Its plan now is to consolidate these two areas and use the common energy to enter the areas of construction and infrastructure operation.
The toll-free subway, sponsored by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office, called the Northern Link, is to connect the Toowong Western Highway with a 5-kilometre-long roundabout in Kelvin Grove (see map).
The schedule set by the local government is scheduled for the summer of 2010 and the start of work for December next year.
Although this paid passage would open in the last months of 2014, the complete completion of the work is planned for 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will contain two currents in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide $500 million (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>308 million) to finance the project.
Brisbane has already offered this order Hochtief
Australia still makes a significant profit for Hochtief, as it announced a deal with the government estimated at 154 million.
ACS will commission, through its local Leighton branch, the national broadband network infrastructure with fibre-optic cable.
This situation will allow fast access to the Internet for 400,000 people and provide the job of a German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company left the 27-story construction project of the King George tower in Brisbane, Australia. Construction work had just begun and Hochtief closed sales for $129 million.
In the UK, specifically in Manchester, it will participate with Laing O'Rourke in the construction and operation of two school centres for 25 years.
The initial investment will be <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>75 million.
FCC awarded tunnel in Slovenia for $64 million
The FCC, through its Alpine subsidiary, has received a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>64.5 million allocation for the construction of a 2.1-kilometre tunnel for the Slovenian motorway.
The company was awarded the contract a few days after the work on the extension of the tunnel in Bosruck (Austria) for 130 million euros.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its experience in tunnel construction.
Work is scheduled to start in early 2010 and the deadline for implementation is 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore got an ad at Renfe
Renfe has allocated advertising and marketing services over the past two years to Ms. Rushmore for an estimated <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 million a year, the railway company said.
The contract includes a 12-month extension each year. Ms. Rushmore was selected from among 16 agencies that presented themselves in the Renfe-listed competition, four of which advanced to the finals, including TBWA , which was responsible for creating advertising for the last three years.
From now on, Ms. Rushmore will be responsible for designing and producing campaigns.
France Télécom fined <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>63 million for blocking competition
The French competition authority imposed a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>63 million on France Télécom for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean regions that belong to the country.
According to this institution, the operator has limited the competition of fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, pricing plans and loyalty programs with consumers on the fringes of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has bought more than 560 million euros in fines since 1994 for putting obstacles to its competitors.
The fine imposed yesterday was de facto increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom committed a similar infringement as in the past and that there was therefore a recurrence.
Trade with Applications
On the other hand, the mobile branch of the French company is still a star among other operators and has opened an online app store in order to increase revenues that will not come from voice transmissions.
From the outset, the Orange app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 to enter other countries as Spain.
Playing in the Champions League has brought from the beginning 476.4 million Madrid and Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a
The Champions League has been a source of income for these clubs since its inception in 1992.
Real Madrid and Barcelona have made 476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth highest-earning club in the competition.
The list is led by Manchester United.
The list is led by Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League isn’t just about fame, it’s also one of the main revenue streams for big clubs.
To the extent that the competition distributed <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,362.5 million among 105 teams (of which 12 Spanish) who have participated in this event since the start of the 1992/1993 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona came out of this division very well.
The white club was third on the continent with the most money it earned for participation, and the only one along with AC Milan to win the top prize three times.
The current Catalan champion and last winner of the 1992 European Cup is in the fifth classification.
The list is led by Manchester United and Munich-based Bayern, two teams that also charge the most money for participating in the last Champions League.
And that's despite losing to Barca.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country to earn the most money through the Champions League, despite winning the most titles of all (five against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
DISTRIBUTION
This seemingly paradox is explained by the intricate money-sharing procedure used by UEFA.
For this fiscal year, the body, chaired by Michel Platini, plans to earn 1,090 million for the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA spends 413.1 million on fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the preliminary qualifying round (including Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who achieved the participation received 3.8 million just for their presence, in addition to an additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>550,000 for each match in which they participate.
There is also a prize for winning (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>800,000) and a draw (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400,000 for each team). The eight finalists will receive three million each; eight quarterfinalists3,3 million.
Each of the last four gets $4 million.
The champion earns 9 million, while the second finalist earns 5.2 million.
In this way, the club earns a minimum of 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million on fixed payments.
On the other hand, Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a won 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
In addition, there are mobile payments for which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is divided according to the proportional value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main and has four assigned places.
Last year’s champion will receive 40% of the money allocated, the second 30%, the third 20% and the fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid according to the number of matches that will be played this year.
Nueva Rumasa offers <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>61 million for 29.9% sauce
The Nueva Rumasa Group yesterday announced details of the offer to buy shares, with the help of which it wants to gain a top position between 25% and 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
This percentage does not oblige to make a public offer for the acquisition (option) of all securities.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa offers 1.5025 euros per share, which it would pay in ten years and for which it would pay interest on this deposit 1% per year.
Yesterday, the shares of Sos ended trading at 1.85 euros; therefore, the offer of Nueva Rumasa evaluates the company by 18% below the market value.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real value of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 members of the board.
The Jerez Group has a 15-day deadline for shareholders to announce their interest in selling the shares.
CNMV said it was not informed of the offer, although Ruize Mateose confirmed that it had contacted the regulator.
If the purchase is made, the price would reach 611.7 million, while the capitalization of Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, the oak continues to change the structure of its management.
As an attempt to remain on the fringes of possible bids to buy and settle the judicial vacancies of his former leaders, the brothers of Jesus and Jaime Salazar, the election of Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Luisa Jord<0xC3><0xA1> as the head of the internal audit was announced.
This decision makes her the first woman to hold a high position in a food business.
It is a newly created place that will be directly subject to the president of the group.
And it is not exempt from controversy, as the company is still immersed in a legal battle over the alleged transfer of more than 230 million from the Sos to the companies of the Salazar brothers.
De facto, it is impossible to reduce the possibility that in the coming months, Sos will reveal new transfers of funds
As for the Salazars’ credit, former councillors Ildefonso Ortega and <0xC3><0x81>ngel Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) testified before the National Court yesterday and confirmed that they had approved the transfer of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV Allows Option to Exclude Paternity Participating Inverter Mer
Yesterday, the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) approved an exclusion involving Mer against Federica Paternin on 9 October.
The supervisory authority has explained that it authorises this operation, as it understands that its conditions comply with the applicable standards, and believes that the content explaining the brochures submitted after the adjustments introduced on 2 December is "sufficient".
CNMV specified that the offer is aimed at acquiring 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, which represents 8.95% of the company's capital, which is made up of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares had been suspended, which would not be able to be transferred in any way until the closing of the offer, which he specified was priced by Federica Paterna under the provisions of the applicable standards.
New Instruments for Appreciation of Cars
These days, storms and accidents don’t just make car service.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered an insurance incident are pulled into the service, where the expert must estimate the damage and the cost of repair.
No insurance event is the same and calculating the cost of parts and labor time can be a long and complicated job.
Calculate manually the repair costs from 20,000 to 30,000 euros including parts and labor can take two or three hours.
However, with the support of new computer tools it would be a matter of minutes
Therefore, almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Service providers and solutions for estimating insurance events and maintenance are dedicated to collecting information provided by manufacturers to then develop and offer their customers a useful tool.
In Spain Audatex, from the American group Solera is the leading company; 80% of the evaluation is carried out with its products.
Other companies competing in the field of appraisal and information development tools are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is not easy at all.
According to Eduard Vel<0xC3><0xA1>zquez, Audatex’s sales director, 63 manufacturers and importers work in Spain, each providing them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is still growing, as more versions, variants and engine solutions have been introduced in the last five years than in the previous fifteen years.
As soon as the new vehicle enters the market, these companies will start operating.
It is a very hot job, because it is necessary to catalog each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and determine its price.
In addition, "intelligent" graphic processing is carried out on each model, where it is possible to "push out" individual parts of tourist cars.
As for the model with massive sales, the work can be done in a week if the process is very fast.
As for a minority car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
The most exclusive models they have information about include Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
With regard to the rolling stock in circulation, they exceed 99%.
To perform the work of documentation and development of databases, Audatex has eight centers distributed around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them specializes in specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (normally mechanics) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>90 million annually in the development of these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data is collected and customers receive updates every two days.
The processing of this immense flow of information allows businesses to use and provide different products.
The most common uses are focused on repair and maintenance, but according to each country, there are also tools for managing spare parts or for calculating the sales or residual value of the car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of used vehicles in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer them in our country, but in the United States it does.
Taking into account the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get the support that professionals in the sector can use.
This company offers ten differenttools, with the star product being AudaPlus, a standard insurance event pricing solution designed for experts.
It includes cars, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it also includes the repair time estimated by the manufacturer or paint shop.
This tool is valid according to the application for each assessment.
The maximum price is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 5.75 for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
After that, each insurance company that makes thousands of estimates negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products such as AudaVIN allow complete identification of the vehicle and the equipment with which it exited the assembly line, based only on the first chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glass and AudaSubastas is an open service to the professional sector on the Internet, which allows you to exclude vehicles with a total insurance event.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, performing geodemographic analyses or detecting deviations by brands or models.
For example, it is possible to study how many modelsof certain brands went through service due to an accident or how many suffered serious insurance incidents during a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
Among other things, it sells Gt Estimate, which is also intended for connoisseurs and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971 as a service provider and solution provider for the assessment of damages, accidents or car maintenance.
Gt Gu<0xC3><0xAD>a Awards is its historical reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in services, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Turnover increased by 20% annually in the last three years and in 2008 they charged <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10.8 million.
At the beginning of last year, the process of internationalization of the installation of an office in Paris began.
Audatex was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company’s sources, 62% of her brother is born in Europe and 38% in North and South America. She works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 services, of which 3,000 in Spain.
Solera Group’s worldwide invoicing (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, up 3.3% from 2008.
In our country, the company earns 19.1 million euros, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was listed on the stock exchange for $1,000 million, and now its shares are estimated to be worth $2,400 million.
It has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 2007 and is included in the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Internet Auction of Crash Vehicles
Last October, the Solera Group bought Autoonline, an internet base for the sale of cars and motorcycles or special vehicles after an insurance event.
The transaction envisioned a subscription of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>59.5 million from 85% of the company’s capital, which could expand next year by the remaining 15%.
The aim of the purchase was to provide more value-added services to customers with access to a huge international market.
This appraisal and buying and selling service is guaranteed exclusively to professionals in the sector such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, servicing, spare parts sales and professional sellers who must register before starting operations.
The platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, of which 500,000 are in Germany.
Among the main markets stands out Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The site currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
It manages 3,000 daily ads and adds about 100 new ads every day in the Spanish market.
According to the Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been discontinued cannot return to service, but can be used as a source of spare parts that have not been damaged.
Vehicles with historical value may be allowed to operate, even if they have been decommissioned, after a preliminary procedure.
Budgeting the service in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex guarantees that the user receives a budget in only four steps: identifying the vehicle, finding a spare part, creating a budget for budget generation.
Ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially for older professionals who are more or less reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database contains 1,034 vehicles, including 666 tourist vehicles, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally, for use you need a computer with an internet connection.
After identifying the model to be repaired, using the chassis number, a real graphical view of the model appears, and then the necessary spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price of labor, surcharges or discounts, and then print and hand over to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an awarding tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that it is service-oriented and does not include an estimate of the workforce.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the customer can finance.
Currently, Audatex is working to make these views three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics welcome, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it to show the inside.
