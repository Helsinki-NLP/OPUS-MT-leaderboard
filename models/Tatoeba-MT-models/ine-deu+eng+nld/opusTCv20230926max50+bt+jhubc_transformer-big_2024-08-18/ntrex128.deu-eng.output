Members of the National Assembly for Wales fear confusion with the Muppets
For some members of the National Assembly, the proposal to change their title to "Member of the Welsh Parliament" (Member of the Welsh Parliament) causes dismay.
The reason for this is that plans are to change the name of the National Assembly to "Welsh Parliament".
National Assembly members from all political directions fear to become the target of the mockery.
A member of the National Assembly of the Labour Party said his group was concerned that the name rhymes with “Twp” and “Pwp”.
For non-Welsh readers: In Welsh, "twp" stands for "doof" and "pwp" stands for "Aa".
A member of the National Assembly of the Plaid Cymru party said the whole group was “not happy” and had proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was open to the name change, but pointed to the great similarity between "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the letter u in the English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a law on name changes, said: “The final decision on names for the members of the National Assembly, of course, lies with the members themselves.”
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 authorized the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the panel published the results of a public hearing on the proposals, which resulted in broad support for the name "Welsh Parliament" for the National Assembly.
With regard to the titles of the members of the National Assembly, the Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs were preferred, while the “MWP” option was most favoured at a public hearing.
National Assembly members seem to be proposing alternative options, but the race for consensus could pose a problem for Chairman Elin Jones, who is due to submit a bill within weeks.
The Law on Reforms will include further changes to the functioning of the National Assembly, including rules on disqualification of members of the National Assembly and the design of the committee system.
The members of the National Assembly may vote on their names during their debate on the law.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on a change of country name
Voters will decide on Sunday whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was set to settle a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province with a similar name to Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour means that this claim is to Greek territory, and has repeatedly spoken out against its admission into the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he would not recognize the vote.
Supporters of the referendum, however, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are silent in the face of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
“The old people I spoke to said there was a bar and a church on every corner in the past,” Adams said.
“There are no more of both today.”
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“People’s social lives look different today,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people find themselves on a regular basis.”
With the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the church leaders assume, and that they “will sooner or later be at the beginning again.”
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums where people live who do not support the remaining refuges.
“The overwhelming majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and thus speed up the complete closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these condominiums will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist community moved out in the 1930s.
A black community, which held its worship services nearby, became the owner of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or support blacks.
In a fire in 1939, the building was severely damaged, but when Father Johnson's parishioners planned the reconstruction, they commissioned the bell game.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly called the bell game "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the bell game in July used other words: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the world's first bell game played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had switched to the larger bell game at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said he was not replaced by St. Martin's.
What has taken place in recent months in St. Martin's is a complicated history of architects and contractors drawn partly by the church's lay leaders and partly by the bishop's diocese.
In July, the municipal board – the governing body of the municipality consisting of lay leaders – expressed written concerns to the diocese that the diocese would try to pass on the costs to the municipal board, although the diocese did not participate in the commissioning of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some community members complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Hai Injured 13-Year-Old In California While Diving To Lobster
In California, on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, according to official statements, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy while diving for lobster.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego, he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy’s cry for help and paddled to the boy with several others to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was happy to have caught a lobster, but then he realized that the boy was shouting, “I’ve been bitten!
I've been bitten!"
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he noticed that his entire key leg had been torn open.
“I scream that everyone should come out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” added Hammel.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack was not known.
Rescue swimmer Captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was concluded that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body area.
Officials blocked access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
According to Giles, there are over 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to push into the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's attacks boats, superdrugs and Debenhams with department stores-like cosmetics departments staffed with specialized assistants.
As part of a large-scale push into the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion cosmetics market, which continues to grow as fashion and household goods revenues decline, the larger cosmetics divisions will be tested at eleven branches nationwide. If they continue to be successful, they will expand to Filial in the coming year.
The investment in cosmetics coincides with the search of supermarkets for ways to use store space previously used for televisions, microwaves and household goods in other ways.
According to Sainsbury’s, for the first time, its cosmetics offering doubles to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees series also gain more space and brand areas similar to those in stores such as boats.
In addition, the supermarket is relaunching its “Boutique” make-up range, making most of the products vegan-friendly – an aspect that is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will be testing at two Sainsbury's outlets. The first outlet was opened last week in Croydon, South London, and a second one will open later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the transition to the daily purchase of small quantities of food in local grocery stores means that supermarkets need to do more to get customers to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, outlets are increasingly looking like department stores as the supermarket chain struggles with more services and non-food items against discounters Aldi and Lidl.
Since the acquisition of Argos and Habitat two years ago, Sainsbury's has set up hundreds of Argos outlets and a number of Habitat outlets, increasing food sales and profitability.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to reorganize its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with boats in the early 2000s, but this ended after a dispute over the distribution of revenues from the drug dealer's branches in supermarkets.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury’s sale of its 281 branch-wide pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
The company said Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer at Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve redesigned the look and feel of our cosmetics departments to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in specially trained colleagues who are available as consultants.
Our brand range is tailored to all needs. Due to the enticing environment and the favorable locations, we are now an attractive destination for cosmetic purchases, which calls into question the previous type of purchase."
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
“Dragon’s Den” star Peter Jones is “angry” after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million store with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the joint homewear and accessory brand Truly.
The business of the two was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The “This Morning” moderator, 37, announced her retirement on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered “Dragon’s Den” star Peter Jones with her extremely short-term withdrawal from her lucrative lifestyle brand to focus on her own new follow-up contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones is said to have been "angry" when the television "Golden Girl" at a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted, due to its new deals - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - to the joint homewear and accessory brand Truly can no longer afford enough time.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and would have likely doubled Willoughby’s estimated assets of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her retirement from Truly on Instagram, Jones left the UK en route to one of his vacation homes.
A source said: “Truly was by far Holly’s top priority.
In the long term, it should secure their future for the next decades.
Their decision to withdraw came as a complete surprise to all involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so soon before the market was launched.
At the headquarters in Marlow, a warehouse full of goods is waiting to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the “This Morning” moderator, who is one of the UK’s most promising stars, could cost the company millions due to high investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and possible further delays in market launch.
In addition, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple spend the holiday together, and Jones holds a 40 percent stake in Baldwin’s TV production company.
Willoughby is set to become a brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as moderator of ITV’s “I’m A Celebrity.”
A source close to Jones said last night, “We’re not commenting on his business affairs.”
Hard words “and then we fell in love”
He joked about the criticism he expected from the news media for a comment that some would consider "non-presidential" and for such positive remarks about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said, mimicking the voice of a news moderator:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting, as the first meeting in Singapore in June was praised by Trump as a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the denuclearization negotiations have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, North Korea’s top diplomat, told leading politicians from around the world on Saturday on the occasion of the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a “corresponding response” from the US to North Korea’s first disarmament measures.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. was sticking to sanctions that should maintain pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
“We are very successful with North Korea,” he said.
“We were at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim showed positive results: the end of missile tests, support for the release of hostages and the return of the mortal remains of U.S. military personnel.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this crowded arena, there would be about 200 people standing here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquakes devastate an island in Indonesia and cost hundreds of lives
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told they would not be needed.
Although over 10 percent of the population were displaced from Lombok, no national emergency has been declared, a prerequisite for mobilizing international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they are not requesting international support, so that is somewhat difficult,” Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it’s not yet clear whether foreign employees can work locally.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the Disaster Reduction Authority, said Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu on whether international bodies should participate in the relief measures.
In view of the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly struggling with, the country is still unfortunately ill-prepared for natural disasters.
While tsunami shelters have been erected in Aceh, they are not a common sight on other coastal strips.
The apparent absence of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, despite an effective warning, is likely to have contributed to the deaths.
Travelling between Indonesia’s numerous islands is already a challenge at best.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but will reach the site of the new disaster in at the earliest three days.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesian infrastructure at the heart of his election campaign and has spent ample money on roads and railways.
However, the government of the next year's re-election-seeking Joko is suffering from funding deficits.
In addition, Joko is under pressure from ongoing religious tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority practice a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes and apartments as gangs of Christians and Muslims fought in the streets with machetes, arrows and bows and other primitive weapons.
View: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge achieves deep draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge Stadium with a hit in the 89th minute before a Premier League loss to Chelsea.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri at a 0:1 back of his team at a distance of about 27 meters from the goal of Chelsea.
He aimed the ball to the left and then shot it in the direction of the rear post.
The shot sailed high over the penalty area and drifted into the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and then into the net.
“I was just trying to get in that position and get to the ball. Players like Shaq are always playing as much forward as possible, so I just tried to make as much time as possible for myself,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming and had contact with the ball. I didn’t think too much about it and just took the shot.”
Chelsea led after a hit in the 25th minute by Belgian star Eden Hazard at half time with 1:0.
The blues striker gave Mateo a pass with his heel back, then turned off near the midfield and sprinted into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic played a quick double pass in the midfield.
Then he shot a good steep pass so that Hazard got into the penalty area.
Hazard left the defenders behind and left Liverpool's Alisson Becker behind in the net.
Liverpool will play in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Death toll from Indonesia tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the disaster protection authority said on Sunday morning.
Many people are said to have been trapped in the debris of buildings that were brought down by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake on Friday, which had triggered waves up to six meters high, official spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was overcrowded with the debris of collapsed buildings.
Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Man on Suspected Murder After Woman Was Struck
After a female body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, a murder investigation was launched.
The 44-year-old was found stabbed in Grayson Mews on John Street at 7:55 a.m. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police are asking residents to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is at an early stage, but I ask all those who have stayed near John Street in Birkenhead and have seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
In addition, I ask all persons, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something with a dashcam, to contact us; they may have information that is of the utmost importance to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman, whose body was found, lived in Birkenhead and was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the crime scene to find out where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and the police said they are in the process of informing the victim’s next of kin.
A taxi driver, who lives in Grayson Mews, was trying to get into his apartment, but was informed by police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he heard what had happened.
Residents are now informed that it will take hours for them to re-enter the building.
It was heard as a police officer told a man that now the entire area is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears dissolved at the scene of the incident.
She repeated again and again, “That’s so terrible.”
At 2 p.m., two police vehicles were inside the blockade and another vehicle was in front of the blockade.
There were several police officers inside the block, who were monitoring the block.
Persons with information are asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and refer to Minutes item 247 dated September 30.
The Cromwell statue in front of Parliament becomes the latest monument in the dispute over rewriting history
Their banishment would be poetic justice for his Taliban-reminiscent destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious artefacts by his fanatical Puritan adherents.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Cricks' proposal as "torment" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate about removing statues, it was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster became the target.
The image storm in the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the false Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the deeds of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s magnificent depiction of Cromwell is evidence of the 19th century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe is worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is viewed by many, perhaps at the end of the 19th century, more than today, as someone who defended parliament against pressure from outside, in his case, of course, by the monarchy.
Whether this is a fully accurate representation is the subject of ongoing historical debates.
It is certain that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure who represents one side of this gulf.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering.”
Killer pig bites Chinese farmers dead
According to local media reports, a farmer in a market in southwest China was attacked and killed by a pig.
The man, to whom only the surname "Yuan" was given, was found dead with a blood-stained artery near a pig farm in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He was reportedly travelling with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that a door to a neighboring pig farm was open.
He said there was a big male pig with blood on his snout in the stable.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 250-pound pig had killed the farmers.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and mutilated,” the cousin, to whom the surname “Wu” was given, was quoted as saying by the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent attacks on other people while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan’s family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although it is rare for pigs to attack humans, such cases are known.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, where the man suffered serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 290 kilo pig pinched a Welsh farmer between it and a tractor until the farmer’s wife could scare the animal.
After a farmer was eaten by his pigs in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs were usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood could act as a “trigger.”
“They’re just playful.
They like to tangle and are very curious, ... they are not about to hurt anyone.
You just have to treat them with the right level of respect,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa bring widespread heavy rains to the southwest of the United States
As forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening on its way across the colder waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring flood-causing rains to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
On Sunday at 5:00 a.m. East Coast time, Rosa had wind speeds of 136 km/h, which corresponds to a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough begins to form above the Pacific Ocean, moving eastwards to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa reaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, high tropical humidity is transported northwards to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will cause up to 25 centimetres of precipitation in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, in the coming days, the tropical humidity generates heavy rainfall in the southwest through interactions with the approaching trough.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation can cause dangerous flooding, water-borne debris, and possibly landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity leads to precipitation rates of almost 5 to 7.5 centimeters per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially in much of Arizona, up to 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation is expected.
Due to the dispersion of tropical precipitation, there is the possibility of flood-like flooding with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
In view of the impending tropical rains, it is strongly advised not to walk into the desert.
Heavy rainfall can cause torn currents from canyons, and thunderstorms bring local wind gusts as well as wind that carries dust with it.
The nearby trough brings locally heavy rain to parts of the southern California coast.
Total rainfall of more than one centimeter is possible, which can lead to a small amount of debris in the water and to smooth roads.
This would be the first rainfall in this region.
The first occasional tropical rain showers arrive in Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, with widespread rain on Monday evening and Tuesday.
On Tuesday, heavy rain spreads into the Four Corners region and continues on Wednesday.
In October, strong temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the U.S. as the Arctic cools, while the tropics remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to drastic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday, there is a good example of drastic temperature differences in the middle of the United States.
There is a temperature difference of almost 12 oC between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the persistent summer heat is trying to re-evolve and expand.
For much of the central and eastern U.S., a warm beginning of October with widespread temperatures around 27oC is expected from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 27oC on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests a high probability of above-average temperatures in the first half of October in the eastern United States.
More than 20 million viewers watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million viewers watched on Thursday on six television networks the captivating statements of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and his wife, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political pats situation stopped, and on Friday, the TV stations interrupted their regular program due to a last-minute turnaround: an agreement negotiated by Jeff Flake, an Arizona senator, according to the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee he was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had been drunk at a high school party, that she had been bullied and tried to remove her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement that he was 100% sure this did not happen.
It is likely that more than the 20.4 million spectators reported by Nielsen saw the hearing.
The company measured the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, the numbers were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has trouble measuring spectator numbers in offices.
To get this into the right perspective: this is equivalent to the spectator figures at a play-off football game or at the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, the Fox News Channel, whose opinion-based moderators strongly support Kavanaugh’s nomination, recorded the highest numbers of all networks with an average of 5.69 million spectators at the all-day hearing.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office released a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed Friday morning by cameras from CNN and CBS as protesters in the elevator pressed him loudly with words on the way to a hearing of the Judiciary Committee.
He stood for minutes with his eyes lowered as he was shot, and the scene was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m right in front of you,” one woman said.
“Do you believe he’s telling the truth to the country?”
“They have power, while so many women are powerless,” said one woman.
Flake said his office had released a statement and supplemented it before the elevator closed that he would have more to say at the hearing before the committee.
All cable and broadcast networks broadcast live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was to vote on the forwarding of Kavanaugh's nomination for a vote to the entire Senate.
However, Flake said he would only do so on the condition that the FBI, as requested by the democratic minority, investigates the allegations against the candidate next week.
Flake is convinced in part by talks with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and then several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s decision was of great importance, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of using Brexit for political purposes
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union, using Britain’s future for political purposes and undermining the nation’s interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will be attending the Conservative Party's congress in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In an interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, intensified his attack on her so-called “checkers plan” for Brexit by calling a proposal that envisages the mutual levying of tariffs by Britain and the EU “completely absurd.”
Deadly Shots on Wayde Sims: Police Capture Suspect Dyteon Simpson in Relation to LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the deadly shooting at Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University (LSU).
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained by Baton Rouge police for murder.
The authorities released video footage of the clash between the Sims and Simpson, and according to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
According to the CBS partner station WAFB, police secured the glasses at the scene and said that Simpson’s DNA was found on the glasses.
After an interview with the Simpsons, police said he had confessed to the deadly shootings on Wayde.
The lawyer reports that the bail was set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner’s Office published a preliminary report Friday that said the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The police thank the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the federal police forensic laboratory, the Southern University Police and the citizens in the area for their support in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the regional enforcement agency for “their care and their pursuit of justice”.
Sims was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played for LSU basketball.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was “deeply shaken” by Wayde’s death and “stand in shock.”
“You’re always afraid of that,” Wade said.
Volcano spits ash on Mexico City.
Ash ejected from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern quarter of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater increased and 183 gas and ash spills were recorded within 24 hours.
The agency monitored numerous cases of grumbles and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on the windshields of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity on the volcano 72 kilometers southeast of the capital since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck Central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists ahead of Independence Day vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between the police and pro-independence demonstrators, and thousands took part in other demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the polarizing independence referendum in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro-separatists, held back by the Bereitschaftspolizei, threw them with eggs and also threw paint powder, creating dark dust clouds in the streets normally populated by tourists.
In the course of the day, there were also hand-mixings with the police, who used their batons to contain the fighting.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted “Don’t forget, don’t forgive,” while unionists opposed them, calling “Long live Spain.”
As the local press reported, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries suffered in the protests.
However, a year after the referendum on 1 October, which was seen as illegal by Madrid but was celebrated by separatist Catalans, the situation in the independent region remains very tense.
Voters had opted for independence by an overwhelming majority, although the turnout was low, as opponents of the split largely boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to prevent the vote in violent clashes in front of the polling stations.
Pro-independence groups had camped outside on Friday night to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part with his wife in the separatist protest, said he sees the prospects that Catalonia would gain independence no longer with hope.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry for joy because they could choose, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite an important, albeit scarce, victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan pro-independence parties this year had difficulty sustaining the momentum. Many of their best-known leaders are either in self-imposed exile or in detention, where they were responsible for their proceedings because of their role in the organization of the reefer.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in favor of police on his phone, said the conflict had been sparked by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in detention since the end of last year, announced his candidacy for next year’s European Parliament election.
“As a candidate for the European elections, the best way is to denounce the degradation of democratic values and the oppression by the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house was framed by car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a house in Londonderry was repeatedly framed by a car.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
In addition, it may have been shot at the car with an armbrust.
Menga hit means 1-0 win over Rangers for Livingston
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the win.
The rising Livingston FC surprised the Rangers and led to the first second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's hit proved crucial for Gary Holt's team to match Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard's team remains without a away win in the Premiership this season and faces the Hearts next Sunday, who are eight points behind.
Earlier on Thursday, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League.
In the meantime, Livingston can increase his winning streak in the division to six games, meaning head coach Holt has yet to record a defeat since his takeover of Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston Misses Opportunities Against Free-Playing Guests
Holt’s team should have been in the lead long before the hit, as his directness faced the Rangers with a variety of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but became slower in front of the goal, so Alan Lithgow was only able to shoot far after sneaking in to hit Craig Halkett's headshot past the goal.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could hinder the guests in standard situations.
In this way, the decisive gate was reached.
The Rangers allowed a free kick, and Livingston prepared a chance in which Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly shot Menga in position, who shot the goal with a ball contact from the center of the penalty area.
At this stage, the Rangers had dominated the ball possession, but could not overcome the host's defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly remained largely uninhibited.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos once forced Kelly to defend.
Scott Pittman was repelled by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow slipped the ball from another standard Livingston situation.
Flanks repeatedly entered Livingston’s penalty area and were regularly taken out of the danger zone, while two required penalty kicks – one by Halkett against incumbent Glenn Middleton and one for hand play – were denied.
"Phänomenal" by Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingston.
They were exceptionally good and exceeded expectations in this upward trend again.
Their playing style and team have hardly changed since their return to the top teams, but Holt deserves great praise for the way he has woken up the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great and led an excellently organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on Trab throughout the game.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
As good as they were at times under Gerrard, they could not reach this standard.
Their last ball was insufficient—once they were able to penetrate the hosts’ team—and that’s kind of a wake-up call for the Rangers in the middle of the table.
Receiving Erdogan with mixed reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), smiling faces and blue sky reigned as the heads of government of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which should serve to repair relations between NATO allies.
There had been disputes over issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey’s EU accession.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police cited security reasons for stopping a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters rallied nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators – many of them Kurds – also got a hearing, condemning Erdogan’s policies as well as the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The opposite protests reflect the polarizing effect of the visitor, who is praised by some German Turks as a hero and scorned by others as an autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The collision occurred at approximately 10:15 a.m. British summer time near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and ambulances took care of the man, but he died at the accident site.
Months before the accident, another cyclist had been killed in an accident involving a driver’s escape in Childers Street, about 1.6 kilometers from the accident on Saturday.
According to the Metropolitan Police, officials were working to identify the man and notify his next of kin.
Roadblocks and redirections for buses are set up, and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six officials injured in riots
According to the Prison Office, six prison officials were injured in unrest in a high-security prison for men.
The unrest broke out on Sunday at around 9:30 a.m. UK summer time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and is still ongoing.
Specialized Tornado officials have been recruited to end the unrest involving eight inmates who are confined to one wing.
The officers were treated on the spot for minor injuries to the face.
A spokesperson for the Prison Service said: “Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed to address an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and would like to make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend longer time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 detainees, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison warden was treated after an attack by a convict at the hospital.
In October last year, police officers were called to the prison to deal with serious riots in which personnel were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flood-like flooding (dry areas may benefit)
It’s rare for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that’s likely to happen early next week when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa pull across the desert-sized southwest and carry the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada as well as southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to approach with rain on Monday evening and move straight across Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported in a tweet that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have come close to Phoenix as a tropical storm or tropical depression up to 320 kilometers!
Katrina (1967) was located as a hurricane within 64 kilometers of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation with occasional up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other parts of the deserted southwest, including the central rockies and the Great Basin, 2.5 to 5 centimetres are likely to be possible, and in some cases up to 10 centimetres in total.
For those who do not have the risk of flooding, the rainfall associated with pink can be a blessing due to the drought in the region.
Although flooding is of great concern, this rain is likely to be partly useful, as droughts are currently prevailing in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, at least extreme drought occurs in just over 40 percent of Arizona, the second highest category,” reported weather.com.
First, the path of the hurricane means that Rosa will land on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa will still have hurricane strength with maximum winds of 136 kilometers per hour and will be located 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, after which the hurricane will move to the north at 19 kilometers per hour.
In the Pacific, the storm will hit colder water and weaken as a result.
Therefore, Rosa is expected to hit land on Monday afternoon or evening in Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm.
Precipitation can be severe in parts of Mexico, so there is a significant risk of flooding.
“From Baja California to the northwest of the Sonora Desert, rainfall is expected to be between 7.5 and 15 centimetres, with up to 25 centimetres possible,” weather.com reported.
Then, Rosa will pull as a tropical storm in a northern direction over Mexico, reach the border with Arizona early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, and then pull up through Arizona to the south of Utah by late Tuesday night.
“As the main danger associated with Rosa or her remains, very heavy rainfall is expected in Baja California, the northwest of the Sonora Desert, and the desert-ridden southwest of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center reported.
As a result of these precipitations, life-threatening floods and waterborne debris are expected in the desert, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
After the discovery of a 16-year-old with stabbing wounds in Somerset, three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The teenager was found injured on Saturday at 4:00 a.m. British summer time in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to a hospital, and his condition is "stable".
According to police in Avon and Somerset, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
The officials asked anyone who had records of the events on a mobile phone to report.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered “under the commonwealth, the anger” of the Democrats.
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the unscrupulous and outrageous tactics of the Democrats,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered “under the commonwealth, the anger” of the Democrats during the entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh told Congress on Thursday, rejecting Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that he sexually harassed her decades ago when they were both teenagers.
At the hearing, Ford also stated his allegation.
The president said on Saturday that the American people saw the brilliance, quality and courage of Kavanaugh on that day.
“A vote for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the confirmation of one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an outstanding record in the service of the public,” he told the crowd in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh’s nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republican voters’ participation in the midterm elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m not joining, but I’m actually joining,” he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting everywhere for great candidates.”
Trump argued that the Democrats saw their mission as “to resist and block.”
The first important procedural vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place in the Senate by Friday, a senior GOP official told CNN.
Hundreds Killed in Indonesia Earthquake, Victims Rise
Authorities said Saturday at least 384 people were killed, many of whom were swam away when gigantic waves hit the beaches due to a strong earthquake and tsunami on Indonesia's Sulawesi island.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a festival on the beach of the city of Palu on Friday, when, at dawn, up to six meters high waves hit the beach, tearing many people to death and destroying everything that stood in their way.
The tsunami was preceded by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still following their activities on the beach and were not running away immediately, and they fell victim to it,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster protection authority BNPB at a conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it swam cars, tree trunks and houses, it hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved at a speed of 800 km/h across the open sea before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees on the run from the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated and housed in 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the Disaster Protection Authority showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, bent and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was shaken by further aftershocks.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian agency BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) said in a statement that the energy released by the massive quake on Friday corresponded to 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
Due to the city’s location at the end of a long, narrow bay, the tsunami could have gotten bigger, the authorities said.
Nugroho described the damage as “comprehensive” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
According to him, the bodies of some victims were found among the debris of collapsed buildings, 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage could have been higher along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicentre of the quake.
The communication with Donggala was completely paralyzed, according to Nugrohos, and there was no information.
According to a statement from the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people live there, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse,” the statement said.
On Saturday, the authorities were repeatedly criticized for not informing them that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the waves arrived according to official information at the time of the warning.
Amateur footage posted on social media shows a man on the upper floor of a building desperately shouting at the people on the street below him before the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water forces on the shore and floats buildings and cars from it.
Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the footage.
The quake and tsunami caused a massive power outage that disrupted communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
According to authorities, the military has begun sending cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuations still urgently need food and other essential goods.
The city’s airport remains closed until October and has only been reopened for relief measures.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims has risen to more than 800.
The situation is very bad.
World Vision employees from Donggala have safely reached the city of Palu, where the employees are housed in tents in the courtyard of their office, but, according to Dosebas, passed scenes of devastation on the way.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even when the aid groups began the difficult task of setting up disaster relief, some warned that expert foreign aid would be prevented from traveling to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, financial assistance, deliveries and personnel from abroad are only possible if the place of an accident has been declared as a national disaster area.
This has not happened so far.
“At the moment it is still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘Okay, this is a national disaster,’ we can accept international support, but so far this status has not been valid.”
While the second night since the earthquake and tsunami on Friday sank over Palu, friends and family members of those still missing hoped for one of the miracles that brightened up the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped in debris next to her mother’s body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games that ended in Indonesia earlier this month.
Others of the prisoners at the Roa-Roa-Hotel were, as Mandagi added, his students.
“As a senior in paragliding, I have to carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon recounted how in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel among the paragliders, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the contestants from Palu who participated in the beach party.
His messages, however, instead of blue check marks, only led to gray question marks.
“I think that means the news wasn’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while filling up a cash machine in Newport on the Levee
According to a Newport police press release, on Friday morning in Newport on the Levee, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink’s employee while filling up a cash machine.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied a vending machine in the entertainment complex and wanted to raise more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, “a man came running behind the employee of Brink’s” and stole a bag full of money destined for the vending machine.
According to the press release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Individuals who have information about the identity of the suspects are requested to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
In announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The being formally known as Kanye West" (The Being officially known as Kanye West).
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has used it as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change precedes his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where the release of his new album "Yandhi" is expected.
He appears on the show as a replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the producer, has canceled for "emotional reasons".
The word is not just an abbreviation of its current professional name, but it has religious significance for the West.
“I think ‘yes’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said in a conversation this year about his album with radio host Big Boy.
“So I’m you, I’m us, it’s us.
From Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, became just ‘yes’ – simply a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, of everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known under the names Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, with whom West previously worked, has already written his name with and without hyphens and capital letters.
Mexico’s AMLO vows not to use the military against the civilian population
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed never to use military force against the civilian population as the 50th anniversary of the bloody repression of students in his country approaches.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use the military to repress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, soldiers fired at a peaceful demonstration on the square, killing 300 people, and left-wing student movements were establishing themselves throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans through monthly student grants and the opening of more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training opportunities led to criminal gangs among young people.
U.S. Should Double Artificial Intelligence Funds
Given China’s increased artificial intelligence activities, the U.S. should double its spending on research in this area, says investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow AI announcements from various areas of the U.S. government, even though the U.S. generally lacks a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: the country intends to become the No. 1 in the field of AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for AI research, given the fact that all other countries are so far behind the US, would be a good start. We are looking for the next AI breakthrough,” said Lee.
Doubling funding could double the chances that the next big AI success would be achieved in the US, Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of the company Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that defeated the highest-ranked American Othello player; later he was a senior executive at Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch in China.
Lee praised previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Robotics Challenge and asked about the timing of the next competition as he wanted to help identify the next visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get government subsidies.
“It’s not China that’s taking away the academic leadership, it’s the companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired coryphs from universities to work on AI.
According to Lee, a changed U.S. immigration policy could also be conducive to U.S. AI efforts.
“I think that in the field of AI, people who are promoted should automatically be offered green cards,” he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China presented its plan for the development of the next generation of AI technologies (Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan).
According to Lee, the National Natural Science Foundation of China funds individuals at academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations donating funds to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, in which partners from industry and science are expected to be involved, and the White House announced the formation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
In addition, this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in the AI Next initiative.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) is currently investing more than $100 million annually in AI research.
In the meantime, nothing has been done about U.S. laws regarding the formation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on change of country name
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's applications to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour means that this claim is to Greek territory, and therefore Greece has vetoed Macedonia’s admission into NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum. A boycott campaign casts doubt that the turnout reached the 50 percent required for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the ballot was: “Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU by adopting the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that for Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the collapse of Yugoslavia, the inclusion in organizations such as the EU and NATO is worth the price.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough MEPs have said that they would stick to the result so that it is decisive.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The state election commission said there had been no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, in which 66 percent of registered voters had cast their votes.
“I’m here because of my children to vote, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko will give their vote in a referendum in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018 on the change of the country’s name, which would open the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and presented chairs in front of tents set up by people who wanted to boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join raised heads, not through the rear entrance,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the integration between Europe and Asia.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will result in urgently needed investments for Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
“I think there will be a large majority for it, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after his vote.
In his words, a “yes” result would be a “confirmation of our future”.
According to a survey published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research on Monday, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Macedonian broadcaster Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said they would vote “yes”.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the turnout must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since its takeover in May last year.
View: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City maneuvered through the entire Brighton defence to score goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling overcame the Brighton defence in Manchester City's 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium on Saturday.
Aguero made his goal in the 65th minute look ridiculously simple.
At the beginning of the sequence, the Argentinian attacker received a pass in the middle field.
He raced between three Brighton defenders and then ran into the open field.
Aguero then saw himself surrounded by four green jerseys.
He played around a defender and then overtaken several other defenders on the edge of the Brighton penalty area.
He then shot a pass to the left to Sterling.
The English striker used his first ball contact in the penalty area to play the ball back to Aguero, who overcame Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with his right shoe and shot into the right side of the net.
“Aguero is struggling with problems in his feet,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We were talking about him playing 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the time.”
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League duel.
This goal fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball on this train far on the side of Brighton.
He shot a good steep pass along the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Sané needed a few trains to steer Sterling to the long corner.
The Sky Blues attacker aimed the ball into the net just before it slipped into the net.
City will play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game on Tuesday at 12:55 pm in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to ruin the game for the Rockies
Since the Nationals were excluded from the playoff competition, there was little reason to force another bet.
The always-powerful joker, however, hopes to stand against the Colorado Rockies on the hill on Sunday, but only if this is relevant for the Rockies, who have a game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West, for the playoffs.
The Rockies scored at least one wild card with a 5:2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but still want to secure their first division title.
“Although we don’t play for anything, we can at least throw because we know the atmosphere of the audience here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level I would meet this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate in this competition?”
The Nationals have not yet announced a starting player for Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to let jokes roll in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom this would be the 34th bet as a starting player, practiced in the bullpen on Thursday and would throw on Sunday on his normal rest day.
The Washington right-hander this season has a statistic of 18-7, an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation in connection with his choice of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court when he spoke about the importance of the participation of Republican voters in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
That’s one of the big, big ones – I don’t join, but in reality I join, which is why I’m fighting everywhere for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take power again by all means, you see the commonality, the abhorrence.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, we’re not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, see their mission as “to resist and block.”
“And you’ve seen that in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry and mean and disgusting and dishonest.”
He named the highest-ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, which sparked public outcry.
“Do you remember your answer?
Did you get the document to the outside?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for you one -- that was a really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour no longer allows all opinions to apply.
The party is intolerant of those who express their views.
When the momentum activists in my local party voted to blame me, this came as little surprise.
After all, I am the last of a series of Labour MPs who are told they are not welcome – just because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she had risen energetically against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized with the reprimand for representing a different opinion than Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically on similar issues, about which Jeremy did not have an opinion with former top politicians.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said "the meetings should be inclusive and productive".
Most of the Friday evening GC meetings in my eight years as a local Labour MP were just that.
Today, unfortunately, most meetings are not shaped by this tone, and the promised “friendly, more cautious” policy has long been forgotten if it ever began.
It is becoming increasingly clear that divergent views in the Labour Party are not tolerated and that any opinion is judged on whether it is accepted by the party top.
This started shortly after Jeremy became party leader. Colleagues with whom I previously believed to share similar political views were now expecting me to make a return and take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed with – be it on national security or on the European internal market.
Whenever I speak in public – no matter what I say – there is a scathing social media hype calling for my re-election, denouncing the political center and saying that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
With this experience, I am not alone.
In fact, I know that I am better off than some of my colleagues, as the comments addressed to me are mostly political in nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist insults on a daily basis and never give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is that insults have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn last week called for the Labour Party to promote a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we no longer allow all opinions to apply, and with every motion of no confidence and every change in the voting rules, the party becomes more narrow-minded.
In the last two years, I have often been advised to put my head down and not express my opinion so clearly. Then I would "have no problems".
But I did not go into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, driven by the neglect of the Thatcher government, because of which my classroom literally fell apart in the overall school, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most – as a community council as well.
I have never made a mistake from my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be in any way unclear about my political positions and about areas where I disagree with the current leadership.
To the supporters of Friday’s motion, I just want to say this: Given the fact that the country is going to race for a Brexit that will harm households, businesses and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
In fact, I am sending this one message not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that I will not be deterred from acting in my best interest by so many electoral threats or political thought.

Ayr vs. Melrose 38:17: Undefeated Ayr team rises to the top
Two late attempts may have somewhat distorted the end result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the victory in this extremely entertaining game of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
They are now the only of the ten teams unbeaten at the top of the table.
Ultimately, the success of the home team was due to their superior defense as well as their better opportunity utilization, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
"We've been put to the test in our games so far, and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, “Acknowledgment for Ayr, they have exploited their chances better than we have.”
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, which was raised by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in charge. However, due to a yellow card for the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who had been cleared for the game by the Warriors, Melrose was able to let the numbers speak, and Jason Baggot took a non-increased attempt.
Climo built up Ayr's lead with a penalty kick, before he scored a hit right at halftime and then single-handedly scored an increased try, making it to break 17:5 for Ayr.
However, Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was increased by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
Following a prolonged interruption due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, which was carried from the field of play, Ayr built up his lead by a Climo-boosted attempt by Stafford McDowall.
Then Blair Macpherson, acting as captain of Ayr, received a yellow card, and again, at the end of a phase of enormous pressure, Melrose had the additional man pay by an unelevated attempt by Bruce Colvine.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling without a ball against Climo, MacPherson scored from the penalty shootout from a touchdown behind the advancing Ayr package.
Climo rose as it had almost since the break, after Kyle Rowe had intercepted David Armstrong's boxing kick and sent flanker Gregor Henry to the home team's fifth attempt.
‘Still Game’ Star Seems Ready for New Career in Gastronomy
“Still Game” star Ford Kieran appears to be ready for a switch to the hospitality industry after it turned out that he was named as the managing director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, whose screenplays he writes and in which he plays one of the main roles together with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the show, and Kiernan seems to be planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, though a Scottish Sun source suggested Kiernan was interested in entering Glasgow’s “flowering restaurant business.”
"The sea belongs to us": Bolivia, surrounded by land, hopes that a court will open the way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol in front of the naval headquarters in La Paz, adorned with Taurus.
There is a blue flag on public buildings.
Fleet bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon bear the motto: “The sea is our legitimate property.
To win it back is a duty.”
Everywhere in landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the coastal section lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century is as vivid as the desire to cross the Pacific again.
These hopes may not be as strong as they have been for decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice to be delivered on October 1 after five-year deliberations.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and expects the result of course with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Across the country, many Bolivians will follow the IGH’s verdict on large screens, hoping that the court in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia’s claim. According to this, after decades of sporadic talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate Bolivia’s sovereign access to the sea.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who faces a controversial fight for re-election next year, much is also at stake in Monday’s verdict.
“We are about to return to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts consider it unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia, and believe that this would also change little.
The UN body based in the Netherlands is not authorized to address Chilean territory, and has stated that it will not decide on the outcome of possible talks.
According to Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law, the IGH’s verdict is already in place six months after the closing plea, suggesting that the case was “not complicated”.
Far from supporting the case of Bolivia, the last four years could also mean a setback.
“The current Bolivian government has ripped the issue of access to the sea apart,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
She suggested that Morales' warlike rhetoric had stifled any remaining goodwill in Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their talks at some point, but after these events it will be extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the view that the court’s decision was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia has “an extraordinary opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end the 139 years of mutually beneficial disputes,” he said.
Calzadilla also disputes that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – uses the theme of the sea as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific,” he added.
“Judgement is a chance to realize that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will only take place if it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it can’t trust Washington.
Ri spoke before the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to put into practice the promises made during a summit between the heads of state of the rivals in Singapore.
His remarks come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, more than three months after the summit with North Korean President Kim Jong-un in Singapore, appears to be on the verge of restarting nuclear diplomacy.
Ri referred to the notion that further sanctions and U.S. resistance to a declaration to end the Korean War would ever put the North on its knees as a “brain-spin.”
Washington is skeptical and does not want to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang taking significant disarmament steps first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal in which the country probably sees the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris show the latest collections for huge headgear, which will soon be available in the shopping streets near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely shield the sun, you don’t have to look anymore.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed a palette of crazy oversized headgear for their 2019 summer collection that fascinated the fashion world at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations over the runway.
The most outstanding piece by Valentino was an extravagant beige hat with a feather-like wide rim that almost crushed the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included watermelons with jewels, a magic hat and even a pineapple, but these are not meant to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks were fitted with sewn-on lips and had more resemblance to Hannibal Lecter than to Haute Couture.
One creation resembled a diving gear, including snorkel and diving glasses, while another looked like a melted ice bag.
And if you want to put another huge fashion statement, you are in luck.
Fashion observers predict that the huge headgear could find its way into shopping streets near you.
The oversized hats follow directly to “La Bomba”, the straw hat with a 60-centimeter wide rim, all worn by Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely impractical hat that hit big waves on social media sent another big creation over the runway: a beach bag made of straw that was almost as big as the model wearing a swimsuit that held the bag.
The bag in reddish orange with fringes and a white leather handle was the highlight of Jacquemus' summer 2019 collection "La Riviera" at Paris Fashion Week.
Prominent stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags to be available in the shopping streets next summer. The designer has attracted so much attention that the demand for oversized accessories will be hard to ignore.”
John Edward: Language Proficiency Essential for Global Citizens
Scotland’s independent schools continue to be distinguished by academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with further outstanding examination results and is only supported by individual and joint successes in the fields of sport, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the highest level of care for their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further education and higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as world citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages are still popular and sought after in schools as electives.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to someone in a language they understand, you reach their head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart.”
This is an impressive reminder that we can’t just rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s exam results show that languages with the highest existing rates are at the top of the rankings of independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages achieved the grade A on the higher examinations.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students in Mandarin scored A on the higher exams, while 72 percent of students who learned German, 69 percent of students who learned French, and 63 percent of students who scored A in the higher exams.
This illustrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now considered elective subjects as well as STEM subjects (science, engineering, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
According to a 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills, 17 percent of the reasons employers cited for job vacancy problems were related to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary when it comes to preparing young people for their future profession.
As more and more open spaces require languages, this knowledge is essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen profession, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage in the future through such a lifelong skill.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give multilingual people an edge over competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct an interview, and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage (15 percent).
For this reason, it is important for today’s children that we now invest in language teaching.
Children who speak multiple languages, especially languages from developing countries, will have better chances of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, different languages are taught at all schools.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while other languages will be taught that are considered to be the most important for the UK with a view to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Wherever your child’s interests are, independent schools will always have a range of languages to choose from with appropriately specialised teachers.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills necessary for their success, whatever the future may look like.
At this time in a global economic environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still of fundamental importance for the future of the country, which is why this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should actually be regarded as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
You have to do it right.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron to make Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday
For fans who want to see LeBron James compete for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time, the wait is coming to an end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday in the pre-season opening game.
How many minutes he will play is not yet known.
“There will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play just a few minutes.
Earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game pre-season schedule after training.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare me,” he said.
Time for Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, a series of campaign announcements.
This is the first of Trump’s five rallies scheduled for next week, including well-meaning locations like Tennessee and Mississippi.
Given the swaying vote to confirm his election for a vacancy at the Supreme Court, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming midterm elections in November as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress.
When is Trump’s rally taking place in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7:00 p.m.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia below as a livestream on YouTube online.
Trump is likely to address Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s hearings on allegations of sexual misconduct, which were conducted this week in a tense atmosphere. The expected Senate vote on the confirmation remains in vogue for up to a week as the FBI conducts investigations.
However, the main objective of this series of demonstrations is to support Republicans who face a difficult election in November.
Therefore, President Trump’s campaign team told Reuters that these five rallies next week will serve to “mobilize volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to maintain and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Control of Congress is so important to his plans that the president will travel to as many states as possible as the operational campaign season approaches,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania could attend and report to media from Pittsburgh" at the rally scheduled for tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling.
The visit on Saturday is Trump’s second visit this month to West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to support West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who has been backed by polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to give him a boost in the polls,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows willingness to fight to maintain hope for singles on Sunday
After three one-sided rounds, the four games on Saturday afternoon may have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of the moment is, as a sports concept, a pure invention, but one that players really believe in, and this is especially true in competitions like this one.
So where is the momentum in your opinion now?
“They were in the lead with six points, and now there are four, so I think that means a little momentum for us,” Spieth said as he left the venue.
Europe is, of course, in the lead, with four points ahead, while twelve more are to follow.
However, according to Spieth, Americans feel some wind in their sails and have reason to feel encouraged, not least in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and can score three out of four points each.
Spieth was tremendously strong from the exit to the green and goes forward with a good example.
The guttural cheers became louder in the further course of his lap as he sank an important putt to decide the fourth match with four points for both of them, after he and Thomas had retreated after two holes with two points.
His putt, who decided the match on the 15th hole for them, triggered a similar scream, suggesting that the American team is not yet out of the game.
“I really need to get back on my feet and take care of my own game,” Spieth said.
That is all that remains for the players.
18 holes to set a sign.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have been the only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days, thus undoubtedly writing the history of the Ryder Cup.
Europe’s unequal but sympathetic duo is at four out of four points and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" was not the only pair that had not beaten a Bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they had also avoided Bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and at the back nine holes on Friday morning.
This series and the seemingly flowing energy between them and the outflow of energy underscores that they are the players to beat on Sunday. Fleetwood and Molinari would be the most popular players to seal a possible European victory at sunset over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at different holes at the same time.
To speak of European fame, however, would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short trial with Sergio Garcia, the four-hero of the morning who played alongside Alex Noren.
A Bogey and two doubles at the front nine holes brought the Spaniard and the Swedes into a grip they could not nearly overcome.
However, on Sunday, no one can help them out of the clutch.
The four and four pairings are so fascinating to look at closely because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they give or don’t give, and the way a strategy can change lightning fast.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far and are clearly in the lead on the last day, but this fourth round has also shown that the US team is ready to fight, which some, especially in the US, had doubted.
Europe takes the lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup with 10:6
Europe is ahead of the USA after the four and four games on Saturday with 10:6 and is going with a solid lead in the last day of the Ryder Cup.
The brilliantly playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went ahead with two wins over the struggling Tiger Woods and was able to score four points in Le Golf National.
The European team led by Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, who wants to win back the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the fours in the morning against the erroneously playing American team and won the series with 3:1.
In the four games, the United States made more resistance and won two matches, but could not catch up.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points in the 12 singles played on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who were named after a sensational Molliwood weekend, only won four points as the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup in their four opening matches.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fours, they matched excellently, beating the enchanted Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more assertive 5&4.
Woods, who had dragged himself through two matches on Saturday, occasionally flared up his brilliance, but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four and four games and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the four in the morning, returned and played the four games as a partner of Henrik Stenson, winning 2&1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three in the world.
For Europe, however, on this pleasant windy day south-west of Paris, not everything went according to their ideas.
Three-time Major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the bar for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They scored a tough 2&1 victory over Spain’s Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter, beating Poulter and Rory McIlroy in 4&3 after losing their first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, it has only happened twice that a team came back after going into the singles with a four-point gap, but as the title holder, a tie is enough for Furyk's team to keep the trophy.
Having been in second place for two days, it doesn’t look like they could start a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea Rejects Unilateral Disarmament Without Confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions would deepen its distrust of the United States and the country would not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization’s annual General Assembly that North Korea took “substantial measures of goodwill” last year, for example, stopping nuclear and missile tests, demolishing the nuclear test site and committing not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technologies.
“We do not see a corresponding reaction from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there is no trust in our national security, and under these circumstances, we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
While Ri repeated familiar North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” approach to denuclearization, where North Korea would be rewarded for successive steps, his statement seemed significant insofar as it had not previously rejected unilateral denuclearization.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, in which Kim pledged to work toward the “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” while Trump pledged guarantees for North Korea’s security.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the 1950-1953 Korean War, while the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington opposes demands for a loosening of strict international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘first denuclearization’ and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal through coercion, and is even opposed to the ‘Declaration of End of War,’” Ri said.
“The assumption that sanctions can force us to our knees is a brainwashing of people who don’t know anything about us.
The problem, however, is that the continued sanctions deepen our mistrust.”
Ri did not go into plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. head of state had highlighted earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean head of state Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea were the other party in the denuclearization issue instead of the US, it would not have come to this standstill in the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.”
Yet the tone of Ris’ speech differed enormously from his speech last year when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target the US mainland with North Korea’s missiles after “evil President” Trump called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who had threatened last year with North Korea’s “total destruction,” praised Kim at the United Nations for his courage in disarmament efforts, but said there was still a lot of work to be done and the sanctions would have to remain in place until North Korea was denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn’t have a time frame for it: “Whether it takes two years, three years, or five months – it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday, “The enforcement of the Security Council’s sanctions must in any case continue vigorously until we have achieved complete, final and verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously intensified sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in order to financially drain Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
In July, on his departure from Pyongyang, he said progress had been made only to be accused by North Korea hours later of making “walk-like demands.”
North Korea vowed this month at a meeting with Moon to demolish a missile base and a nuclear complex if the United States took “appropriate action.”
He said Kim had told him that the intended “corresponding measures” were security guarantees Trump had given in Singapore, as well as steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Learn to Sleep Enough in a Course
A new course at Harvard University ensures that all undergraduate students get more sleep this year. This is a measure against the spreading macho culture of staying awake with caffeine and learning all night long.
One scientist has found that students at the world’s leading university are often unnecessary when it comes to paying attention to themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and is in his opinion the first such course in the United States.
He was inspired to bring the course to life after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
“In the end, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why am I only learning about this now, in my last year?’
According to her, no one had ever told her how important sleep is, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
This year’s course for the first time explained to students how the basics of good sleep habits contribute to academic and sporting performance and also improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and managing director of the university’s health services, said the university had opted for the introduction of the course after finding that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, students see the image of a room in a residential home and click on coffee cups, curtains, training shoes and books, receiving information on the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the effects of lack of sleep on athletic performance and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn that long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and cancer.
Afterwards, they are encouraged to think about their daily routine using a map of the university grounds with interactive symbols.
“We know that it won’t change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know this – just as you have the right to know how the decision to smoke affects your health,” added Professor Czeisler.
The pride of pushing a “night shift” was still widespread, he said, adding that modern technologies and the ever-growing pressure on students made sleep deprivation a growing problem.
To ensure good enough sleep, the "secret weapon" of all students should be against stress, exhaustion and fear, he said, and weight gain could be avoided as sleep deprivation puts the brain into hunger mode so that they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, having completed one of his courses in his first year at Harvard last year.
He said the course had opened his eyes and encouraged him to push for a university-wide course.
He hopes that in the next step, all postgraduate students will be asked to complete a similar degree program before starting their studies at the competitive university.
According to the recommendation of Professor Czeisler, students should be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that comes from electronic screens and LED lighting and can get the circadian rhythm out of the way.
Livingston vs. Rangers 1:0: Menga goal defeats Gerrard's player
The Rangers lost another away game when Dolly Menga's hit for Steven Gerrard's unequivocally playing team meant a 0:1 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to score their first away win since the 4-1 triumph at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team added the second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind the Hearts, who lead by distance in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga hit seven minutes before halftime, and the low-inspiration Rangers didn't seem to have a chance to make up.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth, Livingston rises to third and is only behind Hibernian in the goal difference.
The Rangers also face further trouble after line judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound by an object apparently thrown out of the guest block.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which Ayr overtook and reached the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, stayed with the same eleven Livingston players who took the Hearts one point last week, and would have to be thrilled how his well-trained team kept their opponent under pressure step by step.
The Rangers dominated the ball possession, but Livingston achieved more when they had the ball.
They should have scored a goal after only two minutes, when Menga's first goal led Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his chance and shot next to it.
Then a long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot past the rear post.
The Rangers took control, but their game seemed more hopeful than convincing in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos was obviously of the opinion that he should have received a penalty kick after a quarter of an hour due to a clash between him and Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson did not allow the Colombian's complaints to apply.
The Rangers scored only two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little difficulty with Lassana Coulibaly's header and a tame shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston’s hit in the 34th minute may not have matched the game’s course, there’s no denying that they earned him alone for their hard work.
Again, the Rangers could not bypass a ball long shot by Jacobs in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher shot the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm and chose Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent at half time, and the change was almost instantaneous when the winger put Morelos in position, but the impressive Kelly rushed off his line to block the ball.
Livingston, however, continued to get the guests to play exactly the game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett receiving one long ball after the other.
Holt's team could have expanded their lead in the final phase, but McGregor stood well and defended Jacobs before Lithgow kicked a header from the corner.
Rangers trader Glenn Middleton also late demanded a penalty kick after a mix-up with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanach: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" almanac: On September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
The violinist who has since become the standard element of science has also become a standard element of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" with the seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What in the world is this?”
Rogers: “This is a violin counter used to search for radioactive minerals like uranium.
If you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals."
Evans: “Actually, I hear a crack!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention, which bears its name, lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ degenerate cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” and destroy degenerate cells.
The vaccine helps the immune system to recognize degenerated cells as part of the treatment.
The method removes immune cells from a patient, which are altered in the laboratory.
These cells can “see” a lot of cancers common protein and are then re-injected.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The ovarian cancer of a woman who was treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize degenerate cells, disappeared for more than 18 months.
In the method, immune cells are removed from a patient, which are modified in the laboratory in such a way that they can "see" the HER2 protein common to many cancers, and then the cells are injected again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “promotes the growth of different types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and bowel cancer, as Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method of removing immune cells from patients and teaching them to attack cancer cells has helped in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
After his appearance at SNL, Kanye West released a pro-Trump tirade and wore a MAGA cap ("Make America Great Again").
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was blown up in the studio at Saturday Night Live after he widely praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he wants to run for president in 2020.
After singing his third title of the evening, “Ghost Town,” wearing a make-america-great-again cap, he continued with a cannonade against the Democrats, once again emphasizing his support for Trump.
“I get asked so many times by white people, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s racist.’
So if I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual harassment.
Although the recording of West's Whistleblower was not sent, it was uploaded by comedian Chris Rock on social media.
It’s not clear if Rock wanted to make fun of West with the release.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had difficulties behind the stage due to his head covering.
“I was bullied behind the scenes.
They said, ‘Don’t go out with the cap.’
You harassed me!
And then they say I’m in a submerged area,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continues, “Do you want to see the sunken area?” He said he would “put on my supermancape because that means you can’t tell me what I have to do. You want the world to move on?
Try it with love.”
Variety reported that his remarks sparked at least two outbursts from the audience, and SNL contributors seemed embarrassed. One person told the magazine: "It became dead silence in the studio."
West was later hired as a replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many with a lecture titled "I Love It", in which he was disguised as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: “To one of the most courageous spirits: THANK YOU THAT YOU HAVE BEEN RECEIVED BY THE MASS.”
Talk show host Karen Hunter, however, tweeted that West was simply himself and that was absolutely wonderful.
“But I don’t want to reward someone who, in my opinion, owns an ideology that is harmful to my community and gives itself away (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his ‘art’).
He's free.
The same goes for us,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and was now "The Being formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion, and of course, Prince, the late music legend, changed his name into a symbol and then into "The Artist Formerly Known As Prince".
Accused of attempted murder in connection with stabbing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man with a knife was injured in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendant is scheduled to appear before the Belfast Arbitration Court on Monday.
The allegations will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
"Game of Thrones" star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as the sword-swinging Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor has attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such on-screen roles would result in boys often feeling the need to be strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Harington said he believed something had gone wrong and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Harington, who recently married Rose Leslie, 31, who also co-starred in "Game of Thrones," admitted that solving the problem was "very important."
“I personally think the question is very important at the moment, what went wrong with masculinity,” he said.
“What have we taught growing men about the problem we are seeing now?”
Harington believes that television, due to its very masculine characters, may be partly responsible for the increasing toxic masculinity.
He continued: “What is born, and what is learned?
What is being taught on television and on the street that makes the boy feel like he has to embody this particular side of a man?
I think that’s really one of the big questions of our time: how do we change that?
“Something clearly went wrong with the young men.”
In addition, he admitted in the interview that after the end of the series next summer, he will not be participating in prequels or sequels of "Game of Thrones", he has "enough of battlefields and horses".
From November onwards, Harington will be seen in a reissue of Sam Shepard's "True West", the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing about "Game of Thrones" was that he met his wife Rose.
“I met my wife on this show, so that’s how I got my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose Leslie starred in the Emmy-winning fantasy series Ygritte, the lover of Harington's character Jon Snow.
The two married in June 2018 on Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, approximately 40,000 new cases were reported.
In contrast to the past, transmission took place in the vast majority of new cases through sexual intercourse.
So far, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Compared to the year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is an acute problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against members of the LGBT community is said to be widespread.
Based on the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions are due to insufficient protection during sexual intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised, among other things, general access to HIV drugs to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that employees leaked GOP senators’ data, criticizes “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
Maxine Waters, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff had released the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the MPs' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat was of the opinion that the claims would be spread by “ultra-right-wing” experts and websites.
“Lies, lies and even more disgusting lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information is intended to include the private addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday during a hearing of a Senate committee on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh by an unknown person in the government district.
The publication took place after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was assigned to Waters’ office, and published the information of a member of Waters’ staff, The Hill reported.
“This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security were compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations – was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters’ statement quickly sparked criticism online, including from Ari Fleischer, a former White House press secretary.
“This denial is outrageous,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that she does not have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
People who are accused of something they didn’t do shouldn’t be angry.
You must not be defiant.
You must not question the motives of the accuser.
You have to be calm and quiet.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters’ reaction to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of acting too angry during Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is running in the midterm elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“Great thing, if that’s true,” he tweeted.
Waters said in her statement that her office had informed the competent authorities and law enforcement about these fraudulent allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed and that they are held accountable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my staff."
"Johnny English – You only live three times" – weak espionage parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for Brexit references in every new British-tinted film. This also seems to apply to this revival of the action comedy parody franchise “Johnny English”, which began in 2003 with “Johnny English – The Spy Who Screened It” and reverted to “Johnny English” in 2011.
Will an ironic self-parody on the subject of how obviously fucked up we are become a new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, Johnny English’s license to mess up for the second time has been extended, signaling more than anything else that he is a general comic creation for cinemagoers in the non-English-speaking space.
Of course, he is again the clumsy secret agent who bizarrely considers himself cool and worldly, while in reality he is made up of some Clouseau, a pinch of Mr. Bean and a clasp of this guy, who at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London has a single note on the title melody of "The Hour of the Winner".
In addition, the character was originally based on the chaos behind the retreating travelers and international secret agents Atkinson played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercials.
The last adventure of Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I liked how Johnny English approached a helicopter in a medieval armor and the rotor blades simmered briefly at his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is emerging, but the humor seems rather weak and strangely superfluous, especially since the "serious" film series like "007" and "Mission Impossible" now offer self-confident comedic elements.
The humor seems to be more aimed at children than at adults, and to me, Johnny English’s crazy misfortunes are not as ingenious and focused as Atkinson’s silent film gag in the role of Bean.
The ever-present premise now is that Britain is in great danger.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated the super-secret British espionage network and revealed the identities of all British agents in action, much to the displeasure of the serving agent, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, a bloated and oppressed figure already facing total collapse due to her political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this Quasi-Teresa May character, but the script doesn’t give much to work with
Her intelligence advisers inform her that all active spies have been debunked and she must therefore get someone out of retirement.
This includes the tolpatchy Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher at a chic institution, but unofficially gives lessons in working as an undercover agent. There are a few gags, because English offers a espionage academy reminiscent of "School of Rock".
English is taken back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his former hard-fought Kumpan Bough, who is again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, an annoying woman of higher society, in whose role Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who are always doing everything terribly wrong in the secret service of your Majesty, are back in action, in which they meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful Femme Fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is perilously enticed by a charismatic tech billionaire, Jake Lacy's dark Jason Volta, who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of grotesque feasts: disguised as waiters, they set a chic French restaurant on fire, they cause chaos as they smuggle themselves aboard Volta's luxury yacht, and English unleashes pure anarchy as he tries to make himself into the virtual reality of volatility.
In this last sequence, all the registers are drawn, but as sympathetic and funny as it is, the topic is already dealt with in detail on children's television.
Quite moderate fabric.
As with the other Johnny English films, I had to ask myself, “Can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really suits his talent?”
Labour denies working on a plan according to which the British work four days a week but are to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical plan that would allow the British to work four days a week, but be paid for five days.
According to reports, the party wants corporate leaders to pass on the savings achieved by the AI revolution (artificial intelligence) in the form of an additional day off to employees.
The employees would have a three-day weekend, but would still receive the same payment.
According to sources, the idea fits the Party’s economic agenda and its plans to shift the balance in the country to the benefit of the workers.
The move to a four-day week has been endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as an opportunity for workers to reap the benefits of the changing economy.
A senior Labour party source told the Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“A change will not occur overnight, but a four-day working week is an effort consistent with the Party’s approach to restoring economic balance in favour of workers and with the Party’s overall industrial policy strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first party to endorse such an idea; the Green Party already promised to introduce a 4-day week during the general election campaign in 2017.
However, the Labour Party does not currently support the approach at all.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: “A four-day week is not party politics and is not considered by the party.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell concretized his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy at the Labour Conference last week.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of “anonymous directors” and “profit makers” at public utilities.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that the current shareholders of the water companies may not be able to get their full share back, as a Labour government could “deduct” due to alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed the corresponding plans to appoint employees to the boards of companies and to set up Inclusive Ownership Funds to transfer 10% of the equity of private companies to employees who receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy comment in 60 Minutes on whether the FBI’s investigation into Kavanaugh could change their mind
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his appointment as a judge at the Supreme Court by at least a week and raises the question of whether the agency’s findings could influence Republican senators to win their support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60-minute correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring something to light that could ultimately change their minds.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said at the hearing that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him afterward, this claim was made, and asked if he did.
He was determined, determined and unequivocal."
Graham's voice, however, appears to be carved in stone.
“My opinion is clear as to Brett Kavanaugh, and it would have to explode a bomb,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett vehemently denied this,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And all who called her could not confirm it.”
It is now 36 years.
And I can't see any changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it helped to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will take place in New York, an annual music festival with an impressive lineup of stars and an equally impressive mission – to combat poverty in the world.
Tens of thousands will attend the Global Citizen Festival, which will take place this year for the 7th time, to experience not only the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s true goal: combating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which took place for the first time in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project. As part of this project, an international interest group is trying to combat poverty by motivating more and more people to participate actively in the fight against poverty.
To get a free ticket for the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), you have to complete a number of tasks, such as volunteering, communicating with a leading politician worldwide (by email or phone) or similar measures to raise awareness of the goal – combating poverty.
How successful is the project, given that Global Citizen still has 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of putting a cool free concert in perspective a meaningful way to convince others that it’s time to act, or just another case of so-called clickivism – if you think you can change something by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen announced that the project has been able to record more than 19 million actions from its supporters since 2011 and achieve various goals.
These actions are said to have helped inspire leading politicians around the world to announce commitments and strategies worth more than $37 billion that will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised through fundraising.
According to the group’s estimates, the funds secured so far have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition Project, a partnership of UK-based investors and implementers who have committed to supporting children in their optimal development, and who have pledged to help Rwanda with $35 million to combat malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 global tweets.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that after more than 5,000 actions urging the UK to improve the nutritional situation of mothers and children, the government announced funding for The Power of Nutrition project, which aims to reach 5 million women and children and provides nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, namely the question of what are the reasons why Global Citizen can fight extreme poverty,
They replied, “There will be a long and strenuous journey with heights and depths.
But like the big civil rights and anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, we will succeed because we are stronger and more influential together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the artists who perform at this year’s event in New York, including Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as moderators.
The US could use the Navy for blockade purposes to prevent Russian energy exports – Ministry of the Interior
According to the Washington Examine, if necessary, Washington can resort to the Navy so that energy from Russia does not reach the markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s deployment in Syria is a pretext for exploring new energy markets, and Russia is currently acting at the invitation of the legitimate government in these areas.
“I think the real reason for Russia’s deployment in the Middle East is to negotiate new energy markets, just like in Eastern Europe,” he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to address this.
“The United States, together with the Navy, can ensure that the seaways remain open, and block them if necessary, to ensure that energy from Russia does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event of the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that sees itself as the “voice of power consumers” in the United States.
He drew a comparison between Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are virtually identical.
“Using and replacing fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia,” he said, calling Russia a “one trick pony” with a fossil-fuel-dependent economy.
The statements were made when the Trump administration was in the process of expanding exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe and thus replacing Russia, the far more cost-effective option for consumers in Europe.
To this end, government officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, with which, according to Trump, Berlin became a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2-pipeline, worth $11 billion, is intended to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s massive resistance to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we are all of the opinion that energy should not be used as a means to exert pressure, and that consumers can choose the suppliers themselves," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US has received counterwind from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, the German Industry Federation (BDI), has called on the US to stay out of EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“It is a big problem if a third country interferes in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, the BDI’s executive board after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Wants to “Exactly Review” 2020 Presidential Candidate, Says Senator for Massachusetts
Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would “exactly examine” a presidential candidacy after the midterm elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she is considering a candidacy.
According to The Hill, Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that includes women at the top.
Warren plans to “exactly examine” a presidential candidacy after November 6.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump is steering this country in the wrong direction.
“I’m extremely concerned about how Donald Trump is handling our democracy,” she said.
Warren has taken no note of her criticism of Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, she announced that, of course, an FBI investigation is needed before the vote.
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren voters do not believe they should run for office in 2020.
According to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center and the Boston Globe, 58 percent of potential voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
32 percent of voters supported such a candidacy.
The poll showed more support for a candidacy of former governor Deval Patrick; with 38 percent in favor of a potential candidacy, and 48 percent opposed.
Other names of prominent Democrats who are in question for a possible 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden announced that he would officially decide by January.
Sarah Palin speaks at the Donald Trump Ralley about the post-traumatic stress disorder that Track Palin suffers from
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he is going through when he comes back, all of this can be felt by other families who feel the effects of PTSD and part of the wounds that our soldiers are returning with,” she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as an “elephant in space” and said about his son and other war veterans that they are coming back changed, that they are coming back crippled, that they are coming back and wondering if there is this respect for what other soldiers and pilots and every other member of the military have given to the country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police agency.
18 states and D.C. support a legal challenge to the new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to new U.S. policies that deny victims of gang activity or domestic violence asylum.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district filed a court expert statement Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker questioning the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace-against-session lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August has not been disclosed.
She said her partner “and his violent gangsters” abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors, who support Grace, designated El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where very many people apply for asylum in the United States, as nations struggling with major problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy lifted a 2014 Board of Immigrant Appeals decision that allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of legislation at the state, federal, and international levels.”
“The Federal Act requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the respective facts and circumstances of the application, and this court violates this principle,” the court’s expert statement said.
The lawyers also argued in the statement that the policy of denying immigrants access to the country has an unfavourable effect on the U.S. economy, as immigrants could be more likely to work as entrepreneurs and provide the necessary labor.
Federal Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered in June that immigration judges no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and the violence of criminal gangs.
“There is asylum for anyone who leaves their homeland because they are persecuted or out of fear because of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political conviction,” Sessions said in his June 11 policy announcement.
It was never the plan to defuse all the problems, even all the serious problems that people face every day around the world, by granting asylum.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of fatalities in the race doubles over time
For the survivors, the situation became increasingly worse.
“Everything is very tense,” says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, reassuring her little feverish son at a rescue center in the devastated downtown Palu.
“Every minute a new ambulance arrives with the dead.
Clean drinking water is scarce.”
Residents returned to their destroyed homes to collect their wettest possessions and possessions, storing everything they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and hospital staff, who were damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were completely overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who contracted vertebral fractures and a fractured shoulder, remained outside Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outside due to the ongoing strong aftershocks.
With tears in his eyes, he told how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“Everything went too fast.
I think I was stuck under the invading walls," he told the Associated Press, adding that the reason for staying in the city was a wedding.
“I heard my wife’s cry for help, but then there was peace.
I don’t know what happened to my wife and child.
I can only hope that they are in a safe place.”
US ambassador accuses China of tyranny with 'propaganda ads'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page ad in an American daily newspaper announcing the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accused the state capital of Beijing of exploiting the American press for propaganda purposes.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the China Daily’s paid allowance in the Des Moines Register, the top-selling magazine in Iowa, after accusing China of interfering in the U.S. congressional elections on November 6, a charge China denies.
Trump’s accusations that Beijing has tried to interfere in the US election correspond to the announcement by US officials to Reuters; a new phase of an escalating campaign triggered by Washington to exert pressure on China.
While it is customary for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a far-reaching trade war, with tariffs on imports for both countries.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war should target exporters in states like Iowa who supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former long-time governor of Iowa, which exports agricultural products to China on a large scale, said Beijing has damaged workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad said in a statement in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, is now doubling this tyranny by running propaganda ads in its own free press in the United States.
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is claiming America’s proven tradition of free speech and independent press by placing paid advertising on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, at the newsstands here in Beijing, you will find only a limited number of counter-votes and not a real reflection of the differing opinions that the Chinese might have about China’s troubling economic development, given the fact that the media is firmly in the hands of the Communist Party of China,” he wrote.
He added that one of China's best-known newspapers did not accept the offer to publish his article, but did not mention the name of the newspaper.
Republicans rattle voters ahead of midterm elections with Kavanaugh debacle, observers warn
With many of the most influential Republicans supporting and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on multiple charges of sexual violence, observers have warned of a backlash during the upcoming midterm elections, which could in particular come from women.
The mood in this context was extremely tense, and most Republicans have already mentioned that they are continuing with a vote.
“Such things cannot be reversed,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School in The Hill, said in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that the last-minute push by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) was enough for an FBI investigation to appease angry voters.
“Women don’t forget what happened yesterday, they don’t forget it tomorrow and they don’t forget it in November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, the first consultant and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington, D.C. daily.
On Friday morning, protesters in the hallway of the Senate called “November is coming!” when the Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee decided to hold Kavanaugh’s nomination, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s statement, Mic reported.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are an extremely important topic, said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political observer of the news site.
“People say it’s already high, that’s true.
But it could be higher, especially among voters in the suburbs and younger voters, people between 18 and 29 who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public statement, in which their allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court’s candidate are detailed, observers suggested that a backlash could be the result if Republicans advance confirmation.
“This situation is a turbulent mess for the GOP,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote, the final vote, or the review of Kavanaugh; it’s also about the way Republicans handled it and how they treated it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that supports the election of Democrats, told the news channel.
The Americans, however, seem to disagree on who they should believe because of Ford and Kavanaugh’s statements, with a slightly larger share on the latter’s side.
A new YouGov poll showed that 41% of respondents were definitely or probably convinced by Ford’s statement, while 35% said they were definitely or probably giving Kavanaugh credit.
Furthermore, 38% said they believed that Kavanaugh likely or definitively lied to his statement, while 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford issued an affidavit before the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was attacked at the age of 17 by the drunken Kavanaugh.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate had exposed his genitals to her when she was at a party during her time at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to face Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is currently launching a startup with the goal of establishing competition with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform Solid by Berners-Lee.
With Solid, users can choose where their data is stored and who gets access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said that the intention behind Inrupt was “world domination”.
“We need to be active now,” he said on the topic of startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses the technology of Solid, so that users can create their own personal online data storage or a POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other tools for the private and corporate sector.
Similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all content is available in one browser and at the same time.
The special thing about the personal online data storage is that the user can decide for himself who can access which data.
The company describes this concept as personal empowerment and development over data.
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company uses resources, processes, and related skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers hired to work on this project, as well as a community of volunteer programmers, and a security platform acquired by IBM.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee announced that he and his team will not discuss with Facebook and Google whether to make a comprehensive change that will completely reshape their entire business models overnight.
“We don’t ask for your permission.”
In a contribution to Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt has the task of providing commercial energy generation and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new, solid-based web.
In 1994, Berners-Lee redesigned the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been instrumental in the debate on net neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely confident about this new era of the web,” he added.
Priest Bernard Vann, winner of the Victoria Cross in the First World War, was honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England who was awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I was honored 100 years later in his hometown.
Colonel and priest Bernard Vann won the award for his involvement in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had won the highest British war award.
His two grandchildren unveiled a memorial on Sunday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said that this act was full of symbolic power, as the memorial stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after the heroic act for which his grandfather was awarded.
According to The London Gazette, Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918; through dense fog and under heavy shelling from field guns and machine guns.
Later, he advanced to the line of fire and led the line forward with the "greatest bravery" before advancing alone with a field weapon and shutting down three of the military units.
Oberstleutnant Vann was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918; just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s actions were something he could never do, and at the same time something that makes one humble.
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann, he put down a wreath after the parade under the direction of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann stated that he feels very honored to be able to participate in the parade, adding that the bravery of a real hero will be visible above all through the support of many people.
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead there was Peppa Pig
Imagine you stayed up all night to watch an exciting Bellator 206, and then you can’t watch the main event.
The San Jose bill contained 13 fights, including 6 on the main map, and was broadcast live throughout the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 p.m. then, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, viewers in the United Kingdom were not surprised when Peppa Pig was suddenly seen.
Some remained untouched after staying awake until the early hours of the morning to see the fight in particular.
A fan on Twitter described the switch to the cartoon character as a kind of bad joke.
“Based on government regulations, this content is classified as not youth-free, so it had to be switched to a children’s show at 6 a.m.,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa, the pig, exactly."
Bellator’s CEO, Scott Coker, announced that the company will be working on the completion plan to take viewers from the UK into account in the future.
“I think the problem could have been solved already in the replay,” he said.
“But it’s 6:00 a.m. on a Sunday with viewers in the UK, and we won’t solve the incident until Sunday our time, Monday local time there.
But we'll stick to it.
The change was communicated quite a lot. It went very well confused and it was not always all nice.
We have tried to solve the problem, and have assumed that it is a technical malfunction.
What was not the case was a problem on the part of the government.
I promise it won't happen again.
We’re going to reduce it to 5 instead of 6 fights, as usual, and we’ve been trying to give fans the best experience possible.
The whole situation is quite regrettable."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley 'feels inferior' to sexuality
Tom Daley, who has participated in various Olympic Games as a water jumper, says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but that feeling had motivated him to become so successful.
The 24-year-old said he had only realized at high school that he was different from others.
In the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said that he spoke out on gay rights to encourage others.
He also said that since he became a father, the victories at the Olympics are no longer so important to him.
The actual host of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, pauses due to illness for several months.
In Laverne’s first show, he said that he used to consider himself inferior compared to others, as the love for boys and girls was socially completely unacceptable.
He said, “To this day, the feeling of being inferior to others and different from others is the reason for my power and strength and ultimately my success.”
He wanted to prove that he was a very special personality, so as not to disappoint anyone when his sexual orientation became known.
The two-time bronze medalist at the Olympic Games today is a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to advance the decriminalization of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he spoke on this issue because he is fortunate to be able to live without restrictions and without discrimination and to encourage others.
The three-time world champion fell in love with the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013. The realization of falling in love with a man was an absolute surprise for him.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he shared that the age difference has never been an issue.
He thinks if you had to go through so much as a child and a teenager – he took part in the Olympics for the first time at the age of 14 and his father died three years later of cancer, it’s hard to find someone at the same age with similar experiences.
The couple have had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley since June, and Daley thinks his entire outlook has changed since then.
Last year it was all about gold medals.
But for him, there is now more important than Olympic gold medals.
His son Robbie is now his main winner.
He has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father did not accept the imminent death, and one of the last things he asked was the tickets for London 2012 as he wanted to be at the forefront.
“I couldn’t tell him that he wouldn’t be there anymore,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was only after that that I finally realized that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley won the bronze medal at the 2012 Olympic Games.
“I just knew it’s always been my dream to dive in front of a local audience at the Olympics – that was crazy,” he said.
His first selection of songs – Proud of Heather Small – was also influenced by this, and he heard the song ahead of the Olympic Games and still took care of goosebumps.

Mickelson, who is not currently in shape, is sitting on the replacement bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will set a record at his 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he has to work hard to make sure the whole thing doesn’t turn into a debacle.
Mickelson, who is playing at the event for the 12th time, was sent to the reserve bench by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of events as usual, the five-time major winner spent his day firing on others and working on his game, hoping to fix the problems that burden him.
Even at the height of his career, 48-year-old Mickelson was never the most direct golfer and thus not the ideal cast for the narrow Le Golf National golf course, where misguided balls are regularly punished.
And as if the pitch itself wasn’t daunting enough, Mickelson meets perfectionist British Open champion Francesco Molinari in Game 9 on Sunday, who has teamed up with Tommy Fleetwood, a rookie at these tournaments, to win all four games this week.
If the Americans are four points behind in the 12 individual games, Mickelson’s game could prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk spoke confidently about Mickelson and could not add much to it either.
“He was completely clear about his role today, slapped me on the back and put his arm around me and thought he was ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of self-confidence.
He’s one of the world’s most well-known personalities, and he’s done so much for these teams in the past and this week.
I didn’t think he was in two games.
I had imagined more, but that’s how it went and that’s what we expected.
He wants to be there like everyone else.”
Mickelson will reach Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup career that never fully matched the highs of his personal record.
Mickelson is able to record 18 wins, had to score 20 defeats and reached seven halves, although Furyk announced that his presence alone has enriched the team.
“He’s funny and sarcastic, original and likes to have a few jokes, and he’s a great person who’s popular with the whole team,” he said.
“I think the younger players were happy to get to know him a little bit more this week and it was fun to watch them.
He’s a really interesting person who gives a lot of impulses.”
Captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn knows that the lead may soon be over
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a big lead that leads to the last singles in the Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an unpleasant situation.
The Dane made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but only barely crossed the finish line and led with the smallest possible lead, winning a 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 victory.
“The thought remains that we had a big lead in Valderrama, we had a big lead in Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won, but that’s just barely,” Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn said (pictured in the photo) after seeing the Class of 2018 win 5–3 at both Friday and yesterday’s Le-6 at National.
The experience shows me and all the team members that it is not over.
Tomorrow is the right time.
Put yourself in the stuff and do exactly the right thing.
The whole thing isn't over until the points are on the scoreboard.
We have a goal. We want to win this trophy, and that is where our focus is.
I’ve always said that I’m focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we’re completely clear about what we’re facing on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Happy with the performance his players have achieved on a difficult golf course, Bjorn went on to say: “I would never overturn that.
Tomorrow will be another caliber.
Tomorrow, the individual services will be in the foreground and that is a completely different matter.
It’s great to work with a partner when things are going well, but if you’re out there alone, you’re being tested to the limits of your golfing abilities.
This must be made clear to the players: get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he has to get the best out of it too.”
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk will make sure that his players score individually better than in the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have won three out of four points.
Furyk himself was on both sides of those big turnarounds on the last day of the tournament. He was on the winning side in Brookline before he was on the losing side after Europe's "miracle of Medinah".
“I remember every damn word,” he replied to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you’d like to subtract the fast start you’ve seen in Brookline and Medinah.
When the momentum strikes in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We set up our team accordingly and send our guys out as we feel, you know, we're trying to spell tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the task of catching up, he must compete in the top game against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as other Europeans in the top half of the leaderboard.
“I chose the guys in this order because I think it covers everything,” says Bjorn about his selection for the individual encounters.
Germany's new warship again delayed
The latest frigate of the German Navy should have been put into service as early as 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War era, but according to local media, it will not be delivered until early next year due to faulty systems and rapidly growing costs.
The commissioning of the "Rhineland-Palatinate", the flagship of the brand new frigates of the "Baden-Württemberg" class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the time that appealed to a military spokesman.
The ship should have been commissioned as early as 2014, but the ambitious project was plagued by disturbing problems after the extradition.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg-class, which were ordered by the Navy in 2007, are to replace the old frigates of the Bremen-class.
They are intended to include a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft missiles and marine target aircraft, as well as camouflage technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflection.
Another important feature is longer maintenance periods; it should be possible that the latest frigates do not have to return to their home ports for up to two years.
However, the ongoing delays can lead to the fact that the state-of-the-art warships, which are to represent Germany as a naval power, will already be obsolete at the time of their commissioning, according to Die Zeit.
The frigate F125, tracked by the accident, was on the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy returned a ship to the shipyard after its delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of significant “software and hardware errors” that would have rendered the new ship unusable in a combat situation.
Software problems are particularly serious, as Baden-Württemberg-class ships are served by a crew of only 120 sailors, only about half as many as on the older Bremen-class frigates.
It has also been known that the ship is far too heavy, which leads to performance losses and prevents the navy from carrying out retrofitting measures in the future.
The 7,000-tonne Rhineland-Palatinate was apparently twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including the training costs of the crew, became a problem.
Apparently, costs rose to a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion, compared to the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion originally planned.
The problems with the latest frigates are particularly significant given the recent warnings that Germany’s naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Defence Commissioner of the German Bundestag, confirmed that the navy "exit the operational ships".
Bartels said the problem grew with time as old ships were taken out of service but no replacement ships were provided.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could be taken off the navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
On a property in the Scottish Highlands, new research is being carried out to show how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the results will provide further insights into the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will track dwarf and mosquito bats, as well as the brown longhorn and water bats in Inverewe Garden in West Ross.
Special recording devices are placed at key positions on the property to record the activities of bats throughout the season.
Employees of the NHS and volunteers will also carry out mobile tests with portable detectors.
A sound analysis of all recordings by experts determines the frequency of bat calls and determines which species does what.
A map and a report of the habitat are then created to create a detailed picture of their behavior at the landscape level.
Rob Dewar, conservation adviser for the NTS, hopes the results will show which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This data will help determine the benefits of habitat management measures, such as creating meadows, and show how to preserve forest areas for bats and other related species.
Stocks of bats in Scotland and the whole of the United Kingdom have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleeping places and leads to loss of living space.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flycatchers and the chemical treatment of building materials or even attacks by domestic cats.
Butterflies are not really blind.
However, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation to detect insects and obstacles in their trajectory.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout Scotland, takes the issue of bats very seriously.
It has 10 trained experts who regularly carry out investigations, inspections of dormitories and sometimes rescue measures.
The organisation has even set up Scotland’s first and only bat reserve on the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s 10 bat species.
Property manager David Thompson explains that the property is the ideal habitat for them.
“Here in Threave we have a great area for bats,” he explains.
“We have the old buildings, many old trees and an excellent habitat.
But there’s a lot we don’t yet know about bats, so we’re doing these jobs here and on other goods that will help us learn more about what bats need to feel comfortable.”
He stresses the importance of first excluding the presence of bats before maintenance work in the goods, as it is possible that the unintentional destruction of a single nest site could kill up to 400 females and young animals and wipe out the entire population on the spot.
Bats are under protection and it is illegal to kill them, harass them or destroy them or their nesting sites.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the population to help.
She explains: “We still have a lot to learn about bats and many of our species don’t know what their populations are like.”
Ronaldo denies rape allegations, while his lawyers want to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the allegations of rape against him “fake news” and said that people want to “be famous” by using his name.
His lawyers plan to sue the news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The attacker of the national team of Portugal and Juventus Turin was accused in 2009 of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 to buy her silence on the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
In an Instagram live video to his 142 million followers, 33-year-old Ronaldo called the reports “fake news” just hours after they were released.
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they reported today: Fake News,” the five-time winner of the Ballon d’Or said to the camera.
“They want to profile themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
You want to be famous by my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is good," the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue the Mirror over allegations they described as “inadmissible reporting of privacy suspicions,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player claimed damages for "moral damages at a level that corresponds to the severity of the violation of the law, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personality rights in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in 2009.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went into the player's room, where he allegedly raped them anal, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was “99 percent a good guy” who fell to “one percent.”
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirms that the two had sex, but say it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photos taken of her injuries in a hospital, but later entered into an out-of-court settlement because she was “afraid of retaliation” and worried about being “publicly humiliated.”
The 34-year-old said she was now trying to lift the agreement, as she was still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to switch from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged incident and this summer switched to Italian giant Juve in a 100 million euro deal.
Brexit: UK would ‘perpetually regret’ car manufacturers’ loss
The UK would be “eternally sorry” if it loses its status as a world-leading manufacturer of cars after Brexit, according to Economy Minister Greg Clark.
He said it was “concerning” that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily halt production at the Burnaston plant near Derby should Britain leave the EU.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delays at the border in a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The plant in Burnaston, where Toyota’s Auris and Avensis lines are produced, produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I am convinced that we will experience production stoppages at our plant at the end of March in the event of an uncontrolled Brexit,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director at Burnaston.
Other British automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also raised concerns about a hard no-deal exit from the EU and its impact on cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says it will close its mini-works in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
According to automakers, the main concerns are linked to risks within the supply chain in the event of a hard Brexit.
Toyota’s manufacturing facility is operated on a “just-in-time” basis, which means that the parts are delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers from both the UK and the EU to manufacture the cars to order.
Should the UK leave the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be disruptions at the borders, which the industry says could lead to delays and bottlenecks in the parts.
It is impossible for Toyota to maintain a stock at the Derbyshire plant that lasts more than a day, the company explained why production would have to be discontinued.
Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU "is precisely designed to avoid such border checks."
“We need a deal, we want the best deal that will allow us, as I said, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to seize that opportunity,” he said on BBC Radio 4’s Today.
“The findings not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we need to be able to continue the very successful supply chains so far.”
Toyota could not specify how long production would have to be interrupted, but warned in the long run that additional costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been employed in Burnaston for 24 years and is a senior official of the Unite union at the plant, explained that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, these jobs never come back once they are gone.
A government spokesman said: “We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump's planned meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be “deferred another week” as the dispute over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein has overseen the work of Special Investigator Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia’s election meddling, connections between Trump’s advisers and Russia, as well as a possible judicial impediment by the president.
The question of whether Trump would fire the deputy justice minister and thereby endanger Mueller’s independence has been the subject of rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein claimed the possibility of secretly recording his conversations with Trump as well as the president’s impeachment using the 25th Amendment to the Constitution.
Rosenstein denied the report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday, as new reports of his alleged resignation became known.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at that time at the UN General Assembly in New York, was announced for next Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer not to dismiss Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid colliding with the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, said.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate’s full vote.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “A date has not yet been set, it could be this week, but I can still imagine that it will be postponed by another week, given all the things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
This will prove to be true, but I like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would probably contradict this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Moderator Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders explained that the low frequency of press conferences was not due to a dislike of the TV reporters’ “effect hassle,” but admitted: “But I wouldn’t deny that they do effect hassle.”
She then claimed that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The president is doing more question-and-answer rounds than any president before him,” she said, without providing precise evidence: “We’ve looked at these numbers.”
There will still be press conferences, Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it’s far better than talking to me.
We try to do this often, and you have seen that we have done this many times in recent weeks, which will take the place of the press conference if you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, perhaps, the president showed why this is so when he made a runaway and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of assembled reporters.
Health Minister writes about Brexit concerns to EU workers of Scottish NHS
The Minister of Health addresses people from outside the EU who work in Scotland’s National Health Service (NHS) to express the country’s gratitude and wish to remain in the country even after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government has already agreed to bear the costs of applying for residence permits for EU citizens working in Scotland’s decentralised public service.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, the withdrawal negotiations between the UK and the EU were continued and decisions are expected this fall.
However, the UK government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I am aware of what a troubling time this must be for all of you.
That is why I wanted to express once again how much I value the contribution of each and every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and thus benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is full of your home and we would be very happy if you would stay here."
Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie was reported to have undergone emergency surgery after a head injury he sustained in Saturday's 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury occurred just before the half-time break.
“He came to the sideline and just collapsed there,” Reed said.
Trainers and medical staff supplied Abercrombie with oxygen at the sideline before he was placed on a tray and transported off for further investigation.
A Tennessee State spokesman told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had left the surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details on the nature or extent of the injury are known yet" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a so-called redshirt, plays in his first season at Tennessee State after moving over from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he recorded a total of 5 tackles, bringing his total in the season to 18 tackles.
Foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp duty to buy real estate in the UK
Investors from abroad will have to levy a higher stamp duty on the purchase of real estate in the UK in the future. The additional revenue is expected to benefit the homeless according to the new plans of the Conservative Party
This step is intended to curb the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign for young voters
The increase in stamp duty will affect all those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects additional revenues of up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today that foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp fee if they buy real estate in the UK, with the additional income intended to benefit the homeless.
This step represents an attempt to curb Jeremy Corbyn’s success among young voters, who promises to provide more affordable housing and target top earners.
The increase in stamp duty will be levied on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom and will be used to fund the government's campaign against homelessness.
The surcharge, which will be levied in addition to the current stamp duty and including the increase on second homes and residential properties left for rent two years ago, could amount to up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects the step to increase revenues of up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by investors who are not based in the UK, driving prices up and making it harder for first-time buyers to get a foothold in the real estate business.
Many prosperous areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become “spirit cities” due to the high number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the UK.
The new strategy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson advocated a reduction in stamp duty to allow more young people to have their first home.
He accused construction companies of keeping real estate prices high by buying up land without using it, and urged Theresa May to give up quotas on affordable housing to end Britain’s “residential disgrace.”
Opposition leader Corbyn announced a staggering array of proposals for housing reforms ranging from a rent-fixing to a ban on evictions for no good reason.
He also wants to give city councils more powers to build new apartments.
May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream that life should be better from generation to generation.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who live and work here and want to build a life.
However, it may not be right that it is as easy for people who do not live in the UK, as it is for companies based abroad, to buy real estate as it is for hard-working British citizens.
The dream of homelessness has gone too far for too many people and the unworthiness of homelessness remains too great a problem."
Jack Ross: 'My biggest goal is to manage Scotland'
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, says it is his “greatest goal” to eventually become the manager of the Scottish team.
The 42-year-old Schotte enjoys the challenge of breathing new life into the club from the North East of England, who is currently third in League One and missing three points to the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren back to the first Scottish League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country.
I made it to the bank and that’s it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sports Sound.
“But as a child with my father, I’ve often seen Scotland play in Hampden and that’s something that always pulls me back.
However, this possibility would only come if I were successful in the club management.”
Ross's predecessors in the role of manager of Sunderland include Dock Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic said he was not afraid to follow in the footsteps of such established names at such a club after previously rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
My success will be measured at the moment by whether I can bring the club back to the Premier League.
Given the structure and opportunities in this club, he is undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get him there, but I would only appreciate my time here as a success if I brought the club back there.”
Ross can only have a three-year management career, after a phase as deputy chief at Dumbarton and a 15-month job as coach at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from the relegation to the third league and helped St. Mirren from the edge of the relegation to win the championship the following season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever before in his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“That was probably a real divorce,” he recalls, as he took on the responsibility of Alloa.
“I really think management was the right thing for me, more than just playing.
It sounds strange, because I didn’t hire myself badly, could live well and experienced some very pleasant high phases.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things to go through every week.
I still do this through the stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I've always wanted to manage and now I do it. I've never felt so comfortable in my skin as an adult in my whole life."

The perfect time for a glass of beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., according to a study
The heatwave in the summer has missed a surge in revenue from Britain’s crumbling pubs, while restaurant chains have come under greater pressure.
Pub and bar companies saw sales growth of 2.7 per cent in July, but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 per cent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin of CGA, which compiled the figures, said: “Permanent sunshine and England’s longer-than-expected continued participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a pattern similar to the previous June, in which pubs were able to see sales increases of 2.8 percent.
The decline of 1.8 percent recorded by the restaurant industry in June increased further in July.
Pubs and bars with a focus on beverages showed by far the best performance, with an area-adjusted revenue trend that rose higher than it fell at restaurants.
Pubs with a focus on food also suffered in the sun, but not as drastically as the restaurant operators.
It seems like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In managed pubs and bars, beverage sales rose by 6.6 percent per month, while food sales declined by three percent.”
Paul Newman, RSM’s analyst for the leisure and hospitality industry, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of important social or sporting events remain the biggest factors for sales in the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle with problems, but sales declines of 4.8 percent compared to the previous year will be particularly painful in addition to the ongoing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for operators of companies focusing on food, and it remains to be seen whether the more moderate temperatures in August will provide the much needed break."
Overall revenue growth for pubs and restaurants, including the new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the decline in brand rollouts.

One in five children owns secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One study shows that one in five children, some as young as 11 years old, have secret social media accounts that keep them secret from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 students at secondary schools has found an increase in so-called “Fake Insta” pages
The message fuels fears that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students said they had a “main account” to show it to their parents
One in five children, some just 11 years old, creates accounts on social media that it can keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students at secondary schools showed a rapid increase in so-called “Fake Insta” accounts, a reference to the photo-sharing website Instagram.
The message fuels fears that sexual content will be shared.
Twenty percent of students said they have a clean “main account” that they can show their parents, but also have private accounts.
A mother who stumbled upon the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who urged others to “rape me.”
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles, with half admitting to owning private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, chairman of HMC, said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are being lured into creating online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle becomes ‘Voice of Athletes’ in Scottish Sports Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive member of the Council of Scottish Athletics at its annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most distinguished athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the election as a great opportunity for sports officials to benefit from their far-reaching international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh is respected in the athletics community of Scotland, the UK and the world and we are sure that athletics in Scotland would benefit greatly from their election to the Council,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I look forward to acting as the voice of the athletes and hope that I can make a real contribution and lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the distance over 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, calls a total of four Olympic gold medals his own and today often appears as a BBC expert, could not run after a transient blood flow disorder.
He tweeted: “A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors say that no one can tell if or how far I will be healed.
It was hard work, but I completely recovered, learned to run again and do mobility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging news!”
An advertisement for milk pumps that compares mothers to cows causes excitement on the net
A manufacturer of milk pumps provided excitement in the network with an advertising clip in which breastfeeding mothers are compared to milking cows.
To launch the "world's first low-noise portable milk pump", consumer technology manufacturer Elvie has released a non-serious music video to emphasize the freedom that the pump gives nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn filled with hay with cows in the background to a song that contains text lines like, “Yes, I’m milking myself, but you don’t see a dick at me” or “if you haven’t noticed, these are not udders but my breasts.”
“Pump it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies.”
However, the advertisement posted on the company’s Facebook page has sparked controversy on the web.
With 77,000 hits and hundreds of comments, the video came across mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom say it harmed the “terrors” of the dairy industry.
“It was a very bad decision to promote this product with cows.
“Like us, they have to conceive and give birth to a calf to produce milk, with the difference that their young will be taken away from them within a few days of birth.”
Elvie's milk pump fits discreetly into a still bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment was: “Recognizably traumatic for mother and baby.
But hey, why don't we use them to promote a milk pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
Another person added, “Such a reality-stranger advertisement.”
Others defended the advertisement and one woman admitted that she found the song “urcomic.”
“I think that’s a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I was still breastfeeding.
When I was pumping, I felt like a cow.
The clip is a little crazy, but I’m not trying to overinterpret it.
It’s a great product,” one person wrote.
Another person commented: “This is a funny advertisement aimed at mothers who use milk pumps (often at work or on toilets) and feel like ‘cows’.
This is not advertising for or against the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the group reveals to women that everyone has been dancing with the discreet pumps in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the realization that many women who use milk pumps state that they feel like dairy cows.
However, Elvie’s pump is completely silent, has no wires or hoses and fits discreetly into a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies or even go out during the pumping process.
Ana Balarin, Partner and ECD at Mother, said: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By comparing breastfeeding mothers with dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milk pumps and all the challenges that come with them, while presenting in an entertaining and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump allows.
This isn’t the first time Elvie’s pump has hit the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, designer Marta Jakubowski saw a double mother on the catwalk while she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were quietly taken to a tent town on the Texas border
The number of migrant children interned is as high as never before, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively constant, including as tightened rhetoric and Trump administration measures have made it more difficult to accommodate children with caregivers.
Traditionally, most caregivers themselves were illegal immigrants and are now afraid to become the target of expulsion themselves when they report to take in a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their household would have to submit their fingerprints and share this data with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for the care of unaccompanied minors.
The authorities later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had no prior entries in the criminal record.
“Almost 80 percent of people who are either a carer themselves or a member of a carer’s household are illegally staying in the country and a large proportion of them are criminal aliens.
That’s why we will continue to pursue these people,” Albence said.
In order to deal with the children’s cases more quickly, officials introduced new rules that require some children to appear in court within one month instead of 60 days after being detained, according to staff at the shelters, which was previously the standard.
Many will appear by video switch and not in person to stand before an immigration judge for their legal status.
In the event of a negative decision, the person will be expelled quickly.
The longer these children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious and depressed, according to reports released by the housing staff over the past month, which can lead to violent outbreaks or attempted outbreaks.
Defenders say that these concerns are amplified at a larger facility like Tornillo, as there are signs that a child is having problems, due to the size it is easier to overlook.
They also explained that it can amplify traumas that many of the children already suffer from when they are taken to a tent town without emotional preparation or enough time to say goodbye to friends.
Syria urges US, French and Turkish ‘occupation troops’ to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the civil war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that the foreign forces are illegally located on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and “are treated accordingly”.
“You must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died and millions more have been displaced from their homes since 2011.
He said Damascus “will continue to fight this holy battle until all Syrian territories are cleared” of both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has stationed about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are deployed against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions for their return were given and he accused “some Western countries” of “spreading irrational fears” that prevent the refugees from going home.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to enable the return home,” he said.
“They are politicizing a purely humanitarian matter.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be granted to Syria as long as there is no political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib provided the opportunity for political talks to take place.
The deal between Russia and Turkey turned a broad-based offensive by the Russian-backed Syrian armed forces on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement has “clear deadlines” and expressed his hope that military action will be taken against jihadists, including fighters of the al-Qaeda-allied Nusra Front, who “will be wiped out.”
U.N. Representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to convene the first meeting of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem called the Syrian government’s conditions for participation in the committee and said its work should be limited to “revising the articles of the current constitution” and warned of interference.
Why Trump Will Win His Re-Election
With this logic, Trump would win his re-election in 2020, should not, as many liberal spectators are likely to hope, an impeachment or scandal prematurely end his presidency.
This would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever.”
So far, there is no indication that the audience is satisfied.
Since 2014, turn-on rates have more than doubled to 1.05 million at the best time on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News reaches an average of 2.4 million viewers at the best broadcast time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led the turn-on rates with up to 3.5 million viewers on evenings with important news.
“It’s like a fire that magically attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Bear, showrunner of the “Designated Survivor” drama series on ABC, about a cabinet member becoming president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an old-fashioned comedy writer and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
She asked him the reason.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Scovell told me.
The chaos is entertaining.
Of course, the stories from Washington, contrary to everything that is to be found on television, can determine the future of the principle decision on abortions Roe v. Wade, the possible reunification of families and the health of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond being an informed citizen, if one becomes aware of having already watched six hours of an expert round-up of Danielmy's comments about Bob Woodward's use of sources from the so-called "Deep Background" for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's description of the $15,000-expensive bomber jacket made of ostrich leather (according to the Washington Post)
I will never be able to see Super Mario with the same eyes again.
“Part of what he does feels like a reality show that he presents to you every night,” says Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of The Three from the Pfandhaus series, about Trump’s rotating cast and daily action moves (a fight with the pre-Kimungun League NF).

When I reached Fleiss this week, it was sunny 27 degrees in front of his house on the north coast of Hawaii’s Kauai Island, but he crouched inside and watched MSNBC while simultaneously recording CNN.
He simply couldn’t get off the screen, not if Judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh was about to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Donation funds flood the narrowest races for seats in Congress in the midterm elections
It’s little surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th constituency is flooded with donations, thanks to the newly drawn boundaries of the constituencies, which led to two incumbents in the race for the same seat.
The recently redesigned suburban district in Pittsburgh leaves Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in the course of a special election last spring.
Lamb is facing another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which strongly overlaps with the new 17th district.
The maps were re-drawn after the Pennsylvania State Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were against the Constitution and manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district triggered a shock exchange of campaign funding between the major financial arms of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb was announced in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a highly regarded special election in March for the state's 18th constituency.
This seat was held by a Republican for over a decade and Trump won there by 20 percentage points.
Political experts give the Democrats an easy lead.
The U.S. reviewed El Salvador’s punishment for its support for China, but then backed off
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing without encountering great resistance from Washington.
Trump held a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Valero in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners threw out the Trump Organization’s management team.
U.S. State Department officials have decided to remove the heads of all U.S. foreign representations from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to “the recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” said Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the ministry in a statement earlier this month.
However, only in the case of El Salvador, punitive measures were considered, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug controls, development and economic aid.
The proposed punitive measures, including cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which was to follow a similar gathering in the previous year and represented a step forward in efforts to deter migrants from moving towards the United States.
In mid-September, however, senior government officials made clear that they wanted the conference to take place, effectively ending consideration of punitive measures for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to speak at the conference scheduled to be held in mid-October to signal the importance of the Assembly’s government, according to diplomats.
The three U.S. diplomats have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new harsh announcements or punitive measures from Washington.
A government spokesman for John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity at the internal meetings.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the government, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Learn from history
The next big surprise could be Special Investigator Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible legal disability, for which there is now sufficient evidence in the public eye.
Mueller is now reportedly also investigating whether Trump’s campaign team conspired with Russia in his attack on the US election.
If the majority of Congress changes, Trump will be confronted with an organ that will hold him accountable, precisely at the time he prepares to stand before the electorate again; and possibly before a jury.
That’s a lot of ‘ifs’ and I don’t want to say that the case of Donald Trump, or that of his European counterparts, is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we have to make decisions that will influence how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler if the West had only resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed a chance to avoid the years of barbarism that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and the unstoppable march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
Americans are currently facing several such turning points.
What do we do if Trump fires Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who decides the future of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein got into Teufel's kitchen since last year's newspaper reported that he suggested secretly recording the president and speculating that he was above unsuitable for office.
Rosenstein denies the New York Times.
“How will we respond if Brett Kavanaugh’s newly ordered FBI investigation is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed in office despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and falsehood?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, we have a long winter ahead of us.
But I think we will not fail, because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jewess who was deported to Auschwitz by the same regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me off 60 years later to light Sabbath candles on the table with the hook cross.

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic before the game against Vienna
The Rangers received Rapid Wien on Thursday knowing that a victory against the Austrians after the impressive draw against Villareal in Spain at the beginning of the month will put them in a good position for the qualification of Group G of the Europa League.
Due to a knee injury, Graham Dorrans could not appear up to the 2-2 draw against Villareal, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for bigger ones.
“That was an important point for us, as Villareal is very good,” said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game with the conviction that we can do something about it and we drove home with a point.
Maybe we could have won in the end, but overall a tie was probably a fair result.
They probably dominated in the first half, but we worked hard in the second half and were the better team.
On Thursday, there will be another great European evening.
Hopefully we will get three points, but it will be a difficult game, as they have achieved a good result in the last game, but I am sure that we can go through this with the audience behind us and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a kind of well-being factor.
The team is good and the guys are really good at it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can now look forward, leave the last season behind and be successful."
Anxiety about old age leads to sleepless nights in women.
Although the survey participants knew exactly how to care for them, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study reported talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they would talk to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take the necessary steps to conduct the conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
This is where you should start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to care for you if you don’t express your wishes in time.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you want to be cared for, as these decisions can be an important factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial advisor on board: your advisor can also help you find a way to finance these expenses.
Your financial decisions for long-term care may include traditional nursing insurance, hybrid capital-building life insurance to help cover these costs, or self-insurance with your own assets — as long as you own the money.
Prepare your legal documents: Resolve litigation at the last minute.
Set up a precautionary authority so that you can assign a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that the health care professionals meet your wishes should you be able to express them yourself.
Also consider a power of attorney for your finances.
You select a trusted person who makes financial decisions for you and ensures that your bills are paid should you not be able to do so.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your older parent has a medical emergency and is on his or her way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication or allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
“It’s not just the financial issues that matter. Who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What is Medicare Treatment?”

Man shot multiple times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle when he went home after a job with friends.
The victim, a man in his forties, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen, and hand.
Officials described the shootings, which took place around 2:30 a.m. British time, as a "willful act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries were not life-threatening and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a major earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, adding that the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to the failure of communication systems, auxiliaries were unable to obtain information from the Donggala government district, an area north of Palu, which is located closer to the 7.5-magnitude epicenter of the earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city just celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a district of government in the northwest of Sulawesi Island, stretching over a coastal stretch of over 300 km (180 miles) in length.
In the government district, an administrative unit below the province, lived an estimated 299,200 people in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of income of the economy of Central Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it mainly focuses on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been victims of earthquakes and tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Relief Authority.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
West Donggala was hit in 1996 by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire, and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's northern province of Aceh triggered a tsunami on December 26, which hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people in coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, almost half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes rocked the west coast of Sumatra between late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nias Islands off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of magnitude 6.8 shook southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the south coast and claimed nearly 700 lives.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 hit the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 shook one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: A light earthquake shook the government district of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time, no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people died from collapsed buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit the tourist-favorite Indonesian island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, especially on the north side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded on the island.
Sarah Palin's Son Arrested for Domestic Violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Alaska’s former governor and former candidates for the vice president’s office, was arrested on charges of bodily injury.
The 29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of reporting domestic violence and resistance to state violence, according to a report released by Alaska Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he picked up a friend’s phone when they wanted to interrogate the police.
According to KTUU, Palin is in detention at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and a deposit of $500 has been collected.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where, when asked about his plea, he responded with “Not guilty, absolutely sure,” according to the network.
Palin is accused of committing three Class A offences, punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B offence, which can be punished with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Veteran’s Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, obstruction of reporting a crime and possession of weapons under the influence of narcotics in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of hitting her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans organizations in 2016 after she traced her son’s behavior to a post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his time in Iraq.
Tsunami after earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake that shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Power and communications networks have been disrupted and the number of deaths is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just off the coast of Central Sulawesi, located northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
On social networks, videos are circulating from the time the wave hit the country.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutor's Office Calls for Rare Death Penalty for Suspects in New York Terrorist Attack
The New York federal prosecutor's office is demanding the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the defendant in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people. This is a rare punishment that has not been imposed in the state since 1953 for a federal crime.
Saipov, 30, has been charged with using a rented home depot pick-up truck for a terrorist attack in October when he ran on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov “targetedly” killed the eight ofer and “consciously” inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the statement of intent for the death penalty, which was filed in the southern district of New York.
Both charges could be punishable by death, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal investigative jury, Saipov, filed a 22-point indictment that includes eight counts of murder against the background of organized crime, normally used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as an indictment of violence and destruction of vehicles.
The attack requires “fundamental planning and intent,” according to the prosecutors, who described the way in which Saipov carried out the act as “abhorrent, cruel and corrupt.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov inflicted damage, pain and losses on the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were Argentinian tourists.
For more than a decade, the Southern District of New York has not pursued a case with the aim of demanding the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers and finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in New York at a federal crime was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union two years before.
Both Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, testified in the days and months after the attack of lack of repentance, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to do so after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also called on police to hang the flag of ISIS in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty in all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the public defenders representing Saipov, said they were “of course disappointed” by the prosecutor’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty, instead of a confession of guilt in exchange for a life sentence with no possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma that all parties suffer,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked the prosecution not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative Party MP Calls on NIGEL FARAGE to Transfer Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilize “the power of the people” today during a protest in the context of the Tories conference.
Ukip’s former party leader said politicians “must feel the pressure” of Eurosceptics, while a member of Theresa May’s party suggested that Farage lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backer Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that the UK would be “already out” if Farage was Brexit minister.
The challenge May faces in reconciling her deeply divided party was exacerbated by members of her party, who are in favour of staying in the EU, taking part in a separate demonstration against Brexit that took place in the city.
The prime minister has trouble keeping her compromise plan Chequers on course despite attacks by Brexit proponents, Brexit opponents and the EU.
Allies insisted that despite the backlash, they should continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels and thus force Eurosceptics and the opposition Labour Party to decide between their package and the “chaos”.
Bone stated at the ‘Leave Means Leave’ demonstration in Solihull that ‘checkers belong to the trash’.
He suggested that Farage be appointed as a peer and that he be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was responsible for it, we would be out already,” he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: ‘I will stand for Brexit, but Chequers is on the trash.’
He stressed his opposition to the EU: “We have not fought in world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone rejected claims that public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: “The idea that the British people have changed their mind and now want to stay in the EU is completely wrong.”
Conservative Brexit advocate Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration and told reporters: ‘I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The compromise is unpopular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular with our own party and with our activists, who are actually going through the streets and making sure that we are elected.
Please give up Chequers and start listening.’
In a message to May, she continued, “Prime Ministers will keep their jobs if you keep their promises.”
Farage said in a speech that politicians must “feel the pressure” should they be in the process of deceiving the decision of the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” Farage said.
“They’re trying to cheat Brexit and that’s why we’re here today to tell them, ‘That’s not how you get out of it.’
In front of an enthusiastic crowd, he went on to say: ‘I want you to feel the pressure of our political class, which is just about to betray Brexit.
“We are mobilizing the power of the people of this country, which has helped us win the referendum and will never come to rest, as long as we are not an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
At the same time, Brexit opponents marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A few activists waved banners of the Tories Against Brexit grouping, a group of Brexit opponents within May’s party, which was launched this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a peer of the Labour Party, made fun of the Tories, who had security issues with a party app at the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can make sure that the IT systems, as well as all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, are there for the smooth border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” Adonis said.
“This is a farce.
There is simply no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to 'exactly examine' presidential candidacy
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would “exactly examine the presidential candidacy” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke at a meeting with voters in West Massachusetts on Saturday about her future.
Warren, a vocal critic of President Donald Trump, is currently in the race for re-election to the Senate against Massachusetts Republican lawmaker Geoff Diehl, who was vice chairman of Trump’s campaign team in Massachusetts in 2016.
It was the focus of speculation that it could challenge Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in the so-called Town Hall format since Trump took office.
One of the people present asked her if she wanted to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that it would be time for women to “go to Washington and repair our broken government and that includes women at the top.”
Arrest after deadly shooting at LSU player Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect in the case of the deadly shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims was arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference that it had arrested 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m. Eastern Time.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man to be seen on the footage.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot dead Friday morning near the Southern University campus.
“Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result of this injury,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday.
Wayde wanted to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the scene and possessing a gun and shooting at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The two-metre Sims grew up in Baton Rouge and played in 32 games with 10 starts in the last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after his team leaves him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas landed in qualifying ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes’ stalllords would play a big role in the race.
Bottas made a good start from the pole position and it was almost like leading Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel first went into the box and had Hamilton bump into traffic at the end of the field, a decision that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into the box a lap later and landed behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after a narrow wheel-to-wheel maneuver in which the Ferrari driver reluctantly released the inside, with the risk of stalling after two moves to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started on one of the back spots of the field and was in seventh place on his 21st birthday after the end of the first round.
He was then the fastest for much of the race as he held on to his tires to finish quickly and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He eventually went into the box in the 44th round and failed to make a step in the remaining eight rounds, while Raikkonen finished fourth.
It was a difficult day, as Valtteri has been doing an excellent job all weekend and acting like a real gentleman when he was supposed to pass me by.
The team has done excellent work to achieve a double victory," Hamilton said.
A case of really bad body language
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein at a campaign event on Saturday, insisting that she had not forwarded Christine Blasey Ford’s letter accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse to the press.
At the event in West Virginia, President Ford’s statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee did not speak directly, but commented that the events in the Senate show that people are “common, vicious and dishonest.”
“One thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate is when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and wicked and dishonest,” he said.
“When you look at the leaks and you say, ‘Oh, I wasn’t.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, were you responsible for the leak?
Think about your answer... You published the document – “Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Okay, one moment, please.
Did we... No, we didn't publish it," he added, mimicking the senator's voice.
Feinstein's letter of accusation against Kavanaugh was played out in July and was released in early September, but Feinstein disputes that the leak came from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t publish your story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep the letter secret, and I answered her request for secrecy.”
Their denial did not seem to be well received by the president, who said at the election campaign on Saturday evening: “I tell you one thing, that was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his ongoing defense of the judge’s candidate, who is accused of three women sexually assaulting, the Democrats claimed they would use the allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by all means.
You see the commonality, the wickedness, they don’t care who they hurt when they get under the wheels to keep power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars beat the Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday by a 5:3 win in a rematch in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took the lead early with two goals, after hits by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team the balance before Dwyer restored the Giants' leadership.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the win with two goals.
This was for the men of Adam Keefe, who unexpectedly beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night, the third defeat in the Elite League of the season.
This was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, with the Giant winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute after 3:35 minutes following a presentation by Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later, David Rutherford delivered the presentation when Beauvillier expanded the lead.
In this exciting opening phase, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game after 13:10 minutes, before Matt Marquardt helped Cownie to his equalizer goal after 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before the half-time break when he scored his second goal of the evening just before the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again matched up with a power play hit in the 28th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game late in the second half, then Nielsen secured his team with a fifth goal after just under half of the second half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home at Milton Keynes Stadium on Friday.
Flying lotteries died after he was sure that hundreds of people on one plane escaped the earthquake
A flight attendant in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he died in order to safely take off a plane with hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people died and many are missing after the island of Sulawesi was shaken on Friday by a devastating earthquake that triggered a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks are still felt in the region and many people are trapped under debris in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the highly fluctuating control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
He then jumped out of the tower when he thought he was crashing.
Agung later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Indonesia’s aviation security service, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia’s ABC News.
“We have provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter could arrive in Palu.
We are deeply concerned about this news,” he added.
At the same time, authorities fear that the death toll could rise to several thousand, and the country’s disaster protection authority said that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The number is expected to rise as many bodies are still under the debris, while others cannot be reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the authorities.
Waves up to 6 meters high have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in relief goods and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute a new ambulance arrives with the dead.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
Supermarkets are looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s a tragedy now, but it could get a lot worse.”
Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said in a speech to the country’s military: “I ask you to work all day and night to complete all the tasks associated with the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” said CNN.
Indonesia has been hit by an earthquake in Lombok this year, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini Reports Missing Aircraft Crash in Lagoon, Micronesia
The airline that carried out the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia is now reporting a missing person after initially claiming that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that it would not be able to say anything about a passenger’s whereabouts until Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it would work with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew members after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline said there were six more passengers in the hospital on Saturday, but they were in stable condition.
The cause and exact course of the accident remained unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both stated that the plane landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was flying over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew very flat.
“That’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes explained that he and others were able to wade through hip-deep water to the emergency exits at the sides of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants panicked and screamed and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby on improving a docking site rushed to help with an inflatable boat to bring people to the coast before the plane sank into about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people were killed in the crashes of airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them affected Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the course of the night in which a woman was burned alive
The indictment closed its evidence course on Saturday in the retrial of a case in which a man is accused of banishing a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett spoke for hours as an expert in the field of information evaluation.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone calls to reconstruct the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlett said she received position data from various cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, contradicting his previous statements, according to the Clarion Ledger newspaper.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, police spoke with Sanford.
Sanford went to the witness stand on Saturday and said that he had not been in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he claimed to have been in Sanford’s pick-up that night, Sandford said he had lied “since my pick-up was in Nashville.”
Another contradiction was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for two weeks at the time of her death.
However, cell phone records indicated that they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that some time after Chambers's death, Tellis released their messages, calls, and contact information from his cell phone.
“He took her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is expected to begin its pleadings on Sunday.
The judge assumes that the proceeding will then go before the jury on that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claim that Hip Hop has moved away from its roots of political message and social commitment.
They want to go back to their roots and make socially conscious hip hop again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a renaissance in the UK by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York babysitter sues couple for dismissal after 'racist' text message
A New York nanny sues a couple for a discriminatory dismissal after she received a misguided message from her mother, in which she complained that she was “still a black woman”.
The couple denied being racist and compared the litigation to a “blackmail”.
Two-time mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her dismay when she found out that the new day mother, Giselle Maurice, was black when she started her first day at work in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEEEEIN, NOT A BLACK ONE,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent the message to Maurice.
After she recognized her fake passport, the “painfully touched” Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, claiming that the open-minded African-American mother-in-law had done a bad job and had expected a Filipina instead, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her workday and then sent home with an Uber.
Maurice now sues the couple for compensation for the dismissal and makes a claim for compensation for the $350 per day she should have spent over six months on the job for which she was originally booked, but without a contract, and for which she would have stayed with the couple.
“I want to show them, look, you don’t do that,” she told the newspaper on Friday, “I know that’s discrimination.”
The couple rejected the racism allegations, arguing that dismissal was the reasonable step, as they feared Maurice could no longer trust them after they had offended them.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you entrust your children to a person who was rude to them, even if it was by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the lawsuit to a “blackmail” and explained that his wife is expecting a baby in just two months and is “in a difficult situation.”
“You want to interest such a person?
That’s not very nice,” the investment banker added.
As the litigation continued, the couple were quickly condemned in public and insulted on social media, where they were criticized for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers fear readers won’t identify with a talking bear, new letter reveals
Karen Jankel, the daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to get into someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
Today is very funny with our knowledge of Paddington’s huge success.”
She said her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a small toy bear to write the children's book, would have had no problem with his work being rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication after his death last year was "bitterly sweet".
She explained that her father was secretly proud of Paddington’s success, which she describes as “a very important family member.”
“He was a very quiet man and didn’t brag,” Jankel said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a kid doing something special: you’re proud, even if it wasn’t really your own performance.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although he invented and created it, he always gave Paddington himself was responsible for his success."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone
After landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say that it looked really bad and that the doctors gave her little chance,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got a call from Nad telling me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And that's what I did.
I said to her, "Tashi, I love you so much, sweetheart."
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications the doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping slowly rinsed off and left her body.
She had died just before and this was the moment when everything went down.
I could do nothing but wait while I knew what was going on.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to tear myself apart.”
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who was now mourning the loss of her daughter, and the other passengers, who did not know what she was going through, boarded the plane.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
I had lowered my head and tears ran over my cheeks all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Sad Women Hanging Cards to Prevent Suicide on Bridges
Two women who have lost their loved ones to suicide try to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys hung cards on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers for counseling services.
Davis’ son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and was just 18 when he committed suicide.
“I don’t want parents to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
The 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, said her son was planning a promising career as a chef and he had a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile could brighten a room.”
However, he quit his job before his death as he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s body was found after the suicide of his then 11-year-old brother.
Davis said: “I’m always afraid that this could have a consequence.”
Davis designed the maps to “show people that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t be silent: you have to talk about it.”
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she had been dating for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed or depressed,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas Day, he was at a low point; when the children were unpacking their gifts, he didn't look them in the eye or anything."
She said that his death was a big trauma for her, but that they had to go through it: “It’s cracking a huge hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to keep going and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future in the air as the FBI begins investigations
“I thought if we could actually get something that he asked for, that is, a timely and limited investigation, then maybe we could get a little consensus,” Flake said on Saturday, fearing that the committee would “break apart” in the party’s political stagnation.
Why didn’t Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance can be traced back to the timing alone.
The midterm elections on November 6 are only five weeks away, and if the Republicans were to cut off badly as expected, they would be significantly weakened in their attempts to elect their husband to the country's highest court.
George W. Bush grabbed the phone caller to call Senators and persuade them to support Kavanaugh, who had worked for Bush in the White House and had met his wife, Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There is a vote in the Senate that currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can unite at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to decide on parity and confirm him for the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean runners 'sinks' under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong-seug, who relies on data from the South Korean Ministry of Reunification, said 1,127 runners were registered last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park called stricter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as higher prices of human smugglers as the main factors.
Pyongyang did not speak publicly about it.
The vast majority of overlopers from the North will eventually be offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing over China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China considers the overlopers to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often takes them back by force.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two heads of state met in Pyongyang to discuss the denuclearization negotiations.
This came as a result of the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, where they generally agreed to work towards a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused U.S. sanctions of failing to make progress.
“Without trusting the United States, we have no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, it is impossible for us to disarm unilaterally first,” Mir Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is not fit for the office of the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said he was characteristically unsuitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I could not deny the impression that a woman who had acted like this would have been described as ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
During his inaugural speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes screaming almost and standing shortly before bursting into tears as he spoke of his family and his high school time.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee and called the accusations against him a “great and coordinated homicide” organized by liberals who were angry about Hillary Clinton’s lost presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh’s statement proves he cannot serve in the Supreme Court because it shows he is biased toward Democrats.
“I believe that with these statements and the manner in which he ruled the Clintons and the Democrats, he has declared himself unsuitable,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to remove Kavanaugh from office if he should be confirmed and the Democrats should win the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I will say so much: if he doesn’t tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he’s unsuitable not only for the Supreme Court, but also for his current position as judge,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi went on to say that as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the Abortion Fundamentals decision Roe v. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his hearings, Kavanaugh questioned whether he would revise certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"We don't need a hysterical, biased person who goes to this court and expects us to say, 'Oh, that's not wonderful,'" Pelosi said.
Women need to use it as a weapon.
It’s a sincere hate speech, months and years of overcooking anger and she doesn’t get it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's rare, and you?"
She continued: “I was helped a lot by a woman who was a manager somewhere and said that she also cried when she gets angry but developed a technique. When she gets angry and starts crying, she says to the person she said, ‘You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just keeps talking.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed as a valve for anger, in part because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is of a former job, in a male-dominated office, where one day I was crying because of an indescribable rage and was picked up by an older woman, an undercooled manager, whom I always had a little fear of, and dragged into a stairwell.
“Never let her see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re stinking.
They think you’re sad and will be happy with themselves because they believe you’ve gone to the substance.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Hart was caught aboard a ship called Monkey Business on an extramarital affair and subsequently withdrew his candidacy, the deeply frustrated Schroeder considered that there was no reason not to consider the idea of the presidential candidacy itself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me 30 years later with a laugh.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
As the campaign had already advanced, she was behind the fundraising and vowed not to run if she didn’t get $2 million together.
It was a hopeless fight.
She found that some of her supporters who donated $1,000 to men supported her campaign with only $250.
“Do they think I’m getting a discount?” she asked.
In the speech, in which she announced not to launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by her emotions, gratitude for her supporters, frustration about the system that made the raising of funds and direct addressing of voters so difficult instead of delegates, as well as the anger about sexism, that she stood to tears.
“You could have assumed that I suffered a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls the press reactions.
“You could have thought that the handkerchief manufacturer Kleenex was my sponsor.
I still remember wondering what they would write on my tombstone.
"She was crying?"
Why Beijing Could Benefit From U.S.-China Trade War
The opening ointments of the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and although the battle is far from over, Beijing could benefit from a trench between the countries in the long run, my experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year when he imposed penalties on important Chinese export goods, including solar cells, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week was with new $200 billion in tariffs on goods, effectively affecting half of all goods imported from China into the US.
Beijing hit back every time in the same way and recently raised penalties of five to ten percent on U.S. goods worth $60 billion.
China has vowed to respond to every U.S. move, and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economic power will soon stumble.
To move Washington to deflect would mean giving up, but a public sneeze at the US would be far too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards well, China could benefit from the effects of the trade war in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for economic turbulence in both countries is actually much more dangerous than many observers have previously realized,” says Abigail Grace, a research associate at the think tank Center for New American Security in Asia.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country devastated by the war that has lasted for over seven years.
In an address to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country is improving.
“Today, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer,” he said.
The government is rebuilding the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All conditions have now been set for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government welcomes assistance in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that it would not accept conditional aid from countries that had supported the uprising.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup and defeated Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National near Paris.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown after the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points it needed to defeat the US.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems over most of the tournament, sank his run at the 16th track (Par 3) in the water and lost to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was able to shine in all his rounds and became one of 4 players who scored a 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5:4 by the player with the lowest ranking in the team Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The best-ranked player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Sergio Garcia, veteran of eight Ryder Cups, became the best European Ryder Cup player of all time with 25.5 career points.
“Normally I don’t cry, but today I couldn’t hold back.
It was a difficult year.
I am so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I am so incredibly happy to win the cup back.
It’s about the team and I’m happy to have made a contribution,” said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He goes on to reach out to his compatriot John Rahm, who won the singles against American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday 2:1.
I’m so incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, which I’ve been watching on TV since I was a child,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now has a Ryder Cup balance of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 important titles and is only surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
The USA team had problems finding the Fairways all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have made top-notch performances throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance from his team, “I’m proud of the guys, they fought.
There was a time this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We didn't do anything about it.
Take off your hat for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players performed well.
We will regroup, I will talk to the PGA America and our Ryder Cup committee and we will look forward.
I love these 12 guys and I am proud to be their captain.
You have to take off your hat.
We were defeated.”
