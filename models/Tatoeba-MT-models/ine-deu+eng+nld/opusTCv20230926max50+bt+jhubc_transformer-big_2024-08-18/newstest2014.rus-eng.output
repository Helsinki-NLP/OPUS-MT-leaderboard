In Kinesha and the area, two men committed suicide
Earlier, one of the hanged had already committed suicide.
On October 30, about 1-00, in the village of Lugovoe, at the place of his residence, a man born in 1947 committed suicide by hanging.
It is known that he had previously attempted suicide.
What prompted a man to take such a step is unknown.
On October 31, at 11-50, a 41-year-old man, a resident of Kineshma, died at his place of residence by hanging.
Signs of violent death were not found, the Ministry of Internal Affairs' press service "Kineshemsky".
Is there a black box in your car?
While U.S. road designers are trying to find the money to repair the crumbling road system, many begin to see the solution in a small black box neatly mounted on the dashboard of your car.
These devices, which track every mile driven by a motorist and pass this information on to officials, are at the center of a controversial attempt to modernize America’s outdated highway financing system undertaken by planning authorities in Washington and the state.
Usually, the boring arena of highway planning suddenly gave rise to intense debates and colorful alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying to give the government the right to use small boxes to track the number of miles you drive and even possibly where you drive them — and then use that information when drawing up tax bills.
The tea-drinking movement is in shock.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and raises a number of privacy issues.
And although Congress cannot agree on whether to continue or not, several states are not going to wait.
They are thinking about how the next decade could see a system where drivers pay for every mile of road they drive.
Thousands of drivers have already taken to testing these black boxes, some of which have a satellite tracking function.
This is really necessary for our country.
“This is not an issue that we can have the right to choose from,” said Hasan Ihrata, executive director of the Southern California Government Association, which is preparing plans to begin tracking the state’s miles traveled by every California motorist by 2025.
There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.
The technology for that already exists.
The need for this is compounded by the lack of funds from the Government Fund for the construction of highways, financed by taxes that Americans pay at gas stations.
Americans don’t buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars travel more miles per gallon.
The federal tax, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not risen in 20 years.
Politicians do not want to raise the tax by even one cent at high prices for gasoline.
“It’s simply impossible to keep a tax on gasoline,” said Lee Mannich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
In his state, 500 tracking devices have recently been installed on cars to test the erroneous payment system.
“It will be the best alternative in the long term,” he said.
Boredom calls this the wrong user fee.
It is not surprising that this idea attracts urban liberals, since with the help of taxes it will be possible to change the nature of travel to reduce the congestion of roads and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
Planners in California are looking into this system in the process of developing strategies to achieve the targets set by that state's ambitious global warming laws.
However, House Representative Bill Schuster (Republican, Pennsylvania), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said he also views the system as the most viable long-term alternative.
Free market supporters at the Reason Fund are also thrilled that drivers will be forced to pay for every mile.
“It’s not just a tax that’s going to go into the black hole,” said Adrian Moore, Reason’s vice president of political affairs.
People pay directly for what they get.
The move is also backed by two former U.S. transport ministers, who in 2011 called on Congress to move in the direction of wrongful payment.
Last year, the U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project that would involve about 10,000 vehicles.
However, House leaders rejected the proposal because of concerns from rural legislators representing voters, who in everyday life often have to travel many miles to get to work or to the city.
A few states and cities, however, go this route on their own.
The biggest enthusiasm is in the state of Oregon, where 5,000 drivers are involved in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the state for mileage instead of the gas tax.
In Nevada, the pilot project has already been completed.
In New York, it is under consideration.
Illinois will test it on a limited basis with the participation of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport departments of the 17 eastern states (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), is exploring how they can make these changes.
This concept has not been universally accepted.
In Nevada, where about 50 vehicles of volunteers were recently equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the government could track every step of the way.
“Concerns about the big brother and things like that are a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, who heads strategy and efficiency management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It wasn’t what people wanted.
As the tests went on, the American Civil Liberties Union office in Nevada warned on its website: “It will not be difficult to turn these devices into full-scale surveillance devices.”
There is no need to create a huge, cumbersome technological infrastructure, which will inevitably be expanded to store records of the daily movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of several states where the search for a low-cost technology that would allow the state authorities to keep track of miles traveled by car, but without information about the location and time.
If you can do that, Khan said, society will feel more at ease.
The search for this technology led some state agencies to a small young company in California called True Mileage.
Initially, this company was not involved in helping to collect state taxes.
It sought to enter the emerging market of the type of auto insurance, in which drivers pay on the basis of mileage.
But the devices it tests attract road designers because they don’t use GPS and provide a limited amount of information that is periodically loaded via a modem.
“People will be more likely to do this if you don’t track their speed and track their location,” said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
There were some big mistakes in some of these state pilot programs.
There are much less expensive and less obsessive ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers are experimenting with providing drivers with a variety of options.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they can completely abandon the device, deciding instead to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles that all residents of the state pass.
Elsewhere, they hope to sell the idea to the cautious public, forcing the devices to do more, not less.
In New York, transportation officials are looking to develop a taxing device that will also accept parking meters, provide “pay as you drive” insurance, and collect a real-time speed data pool from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
“Automobilists will be attracted to the participation of the benefits that will be offered to them,” the city planning document says.
Some transport system designers, however, are wondering whether not all talk of mispayment is just a huge distraction.
In the city’s San Francisco Bay Area Transportation Commission, officials say Congress could very easily overcome the bankruptcy of the Trust Fund for Highway Construction by raising taxes on gasoline.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be levied on drivers of hybrid vehicles and other persons whose vehicles do not use much gasoline to pay their fair share.
“There’s no need for radical surgery when all you need to do is take aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, director of the law and public relations commission.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their privacy and a lot of other things.
EU prepares measures to support Ukraine in case of economic pressure from Russia
The European Union has a contingency plan to provide Ukraine with gas, as well as to reach an agreement with the IMF on an emergency loan, if Russia takes any measures in response to the possible signing of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement at the Vilnius Summit.
The IMF is negotiating a stand-by loan, and another EU official, directly involved in the negotiations, added that their goal is to conclude an agreement in the near future.
In addition to a potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine can receive 610 million euros from the European Union itself.
Analysts interviewed by Reuters doubt that Ukraine and the IMF are capable of overcoming long-standing disagreements on funding conditions.
Does not believe in the possibility of reforms necessary to obtain assistance, and the international rating agency S&P, which lowered on Friday the sovereign rating of Ukraine by one degree - to "B-" with "B".
However, EU representatives say that the IMF can show flexibility in terms of lending, taking into account the circumstances of Ukraine.
In addition to the country’s financial support plan, the EU has a backup option to provide Ukraine with gas, the vast majority of which is now coming from Russia.
Perhaps it will be gas from the "North Stream" or reverse from Slovakia.
The latter, according to officials, is the most possible and acceptable way in the event that Russia "isolates" Ukraine.
Analysts believe that this method of reversible deliveries to Ukraine can only be used for a few weeks, and is likely to lead to a decrease in deliveries to other regions.
"Negotiations are underway between EU countries and Ukrainians on how to create favorable conditions so that Ukraine can import gas from other sources, not from Russia, or from the same source, but on other routes," the source added.
Russia out of the fight for pollution of cities by cars
Attempts to solve the transport problems of large cities have been observed in most of the world's megacities since the second half of the twentieth century.
As a rule, it was either about their redevelopment and expansion of the highways, or about attempts to reduce the demand for road trips, the number of cars and the time of their use.
There is a well-known example of Singapore, where a strict quota for the increase in the number of private cars is introduced, and the right to purchase them is bought at auction.
Its price can be two or three times the price of the car itself.
European cities, including London, have introduced a fee for entering the city centre.
In Germany, for example, in Hamburg and Stuttgart, so-called green zones are introduced, where entry is allowed only for cars with a certain eco-class, which also use high-quality fuels (including biofuels or electric vehicles).
The Beijing Environmental Protection Agency, for example, approved in 2012 a "five-year clean air plan" with a total cost of about 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).
According to the director of the transport pollution control department of the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, Li Kunsheng, the main goal of the five-year - to reduce the leading air pollutants by 20-35% by 2017, the increase in the number of private cars increased to a level of not more than 6 million (now also 5.2 million).
According to the agency, car transport in Beijing is now responsible for 22.5% of the total air pollution.
Among the main measures of the program are the restriction of the use of road transport, as well as the introduction of additional taxes for car owners.
Among other things, the urban measures of the "green five-year" include the development of the urban transport accelerated compared to the rest of the country, the transition to the European fuel standards, the introduction of the local system of eco-standards and the marking of cars and fuel, the restriction on the entry of cars into the central part of the city, the prohibition on the use of outdated vehicles.
The number of car innovations of Beijing also includes a ban for all private cars on traffic within the fifth transport ring (in total in the capital of the People's Republic of China there are six) one day a week (corresponding information is contained in the registration number of the vehicle), as well as the issue of registration plates for cars on the basis of the lottery.
According to the current state program "Environmental Protection for 2012-2020", the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 there were 138).
According to the Ministry of Natural Resources, in 2011 the “mobile sources” accounted for 41% of all emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere of cities.
In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars are ten times higher than industrial ones, and in St. Petersburg - nine times.
In the Russian Federation, they are just beginning to think about the possibilities of restrictive regulation of cars on the streets of cities.
Mikhail Blinkin, director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the Higher Education Institution, believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing the demand for road trips are unpopular, they can only be adopted by society if they are fully universal.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem related to the structure of its fleet, where there are two clusters weakly sensitive to any regulatory impacts - commercial and personal cars, as well as cars of "privileged" users, the total number of which is at least 200,000 (about 5% of the total number of cars in Moscow).
Recently, urban planners from the ECOM Center in St. Petersburg prepared a study that analyzes the balance of urban areas between residential development, road surface area and the amount of road transport.
The main conclusions of the researchers: the city center is provided with roads twice as much as required, and most motorists living in the center do not use cars every day, leaving them for a long time in parking lots or just on the streets.
As a result, it is proposed to build not parking lots, but car storage, not to expand, but to reduce the road section (so that the streets become more pedestrian-friendly), as well as to limit the use and placement of personal transport within the territory of the city's security zone of the historic center (a total area of about 3212 square meters).
Penalties for unauthorized street trade in Vologda will increase at times
According to the city authorities, the increase in the size of the fines will help to bring order in Vologda and free the streets from natural tents and trays.
Most street vendors do not pay taxes, the products they sell often do not pass adequate sanitary controls.
This means that the health of the moisturizers is endangered.
Thus, the lower limit of the fine for citizens for unauthorized trade from November will increase six times - from 500 rubles to 3000 rubles, reports the press service of the Vologda Administration.
Goldman Sachs warns of risks to Russian economy
Goldman Sachs has warned of growing risks for Russia’s main driver of fragile economic growth – consumption.
This is primarily a crisis of non-payments for unsecured consumer loans and massive employee cuts.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed down, but rather, the structure of that growth.
Recently, it is completely driven by consumption, which almost does not slow down the turnover," said the chief economist of Goldman Sachs in Russia Clemens Grafe, presenting yesterday the quarterly report of the investment bank on the Russian economy.
Now the nominal wage growth in Russia is about 10%.
With inflation at 6%, it will be able to provide future consumer demand at roughly the current level, Goldman Sachs expects.
But the profitability of Russian companies is falling, so it is likely that they will optimize personnel costs.
Today we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages increase by 10%, then GDP - only by 2%, - explained Mr. Grafe.
The companies were faced with a reduction in profitability.
If it does not grow, it can lead to redundancies and an increase in unemployment.
Russian business cannot not raise wages, comments the chief economist of Barclays Capital on Russia and the CIS Vladimir Pantyushin.
Unemployment close to historical minimums, competition for workers is high.
In order to lure employees away or keep current ones, employers have to raise wages.
Consumption in Russia is booming and very rapid growth in consumer credit.
According to Mr. Graf, due to the extremely high rates of consumer loans, this type of lending does not have a multiplier effect on the country's economy.
“We have not seen any benefits for the economy from the growth of consumer lending, the money does not diverge in the economy, but returns to the same banks in the form of interest payments,” the economist said.
But the problem is another - Goldman Sachs expects an increase in default on unsecured loans.
They are mainly taken by poor people, who have nothing to provide.
Interest rates on such loans are high.
As a result, they are not returned more often," said Mr. Grafe.
Therefore, the second threat to the growth of the economy in Russia is a possible crisis of defaults on unsecured loans.
The Director of the Banking Institute of VSE Vasily Solodkov already sees signs of a maturing banking crisis.
Small credit institutions, without access to the cheap resources of the state banks, were forced to attract public funds at high interest rates.
In response, the state banks went on the path of war and began to lower credit rates, - continues the economist.
Small credit institutions cannot issue loans at the same interest rates, otherwise they will have a negative interest margin.
If the state banks do not abandon dumping, Russia is threatened by a full-fledged banking crisis, believes Vasily Solodkov.
The deprivation of licenses of a number of banks in recent weeks, the economist considers a forerunner of a mass collapse.
"The state banks themselves will not cope with such a situation: the deposit insurance system was initially not designed for a systemic crisis," the head of the institute warns.
But consumption growth will slow down without a crisis of non-payments, the investment bank believes, due to the failure to index the salaries of civil servants and the military, enshrined in the current version of the draft budget.
In part, the impact on consumption will be mitigated by freezing the tariffs of natural monopolies (and, as a consequence, by lowering inflation).
But only in part: if the investment does not grow (and the prerequisites for this are not yet - see the reference), the growth of consumption will still slow down, Goldman Sachs is confident.
Vladimir Pantyushin of Barclays Capital does not yet see the prerequisites for the implementation of pessimistic scenarios.
“The main risk is still a fall in the price of oil,” he says.
According to him, the Russian economy will begin to shrink with the price of oil below $ 90 / bar.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the Central Bank is not yet in a position to lower interest rates in the economy.
There is a paradoxical picture: inflation has fallen and banks have started to raise rates.
This may mean that they did not believe the Central Bank, which announced the transition to inflation targeting,” said Clemens Grafe.
The Central Bank’s interest rate policy does not affect market rates, it only affects interbank lending rates.
"For the Central Bank, this is the collapse of all hopes," Clemens Grafe said.
The money received at the auctions of the Central Bank is not used by banks to lend to the economy, but to manage their liquidity.
As soon as the rate drops, the exchange rate immediately changes, which means that the funds are trying to go on speculation against the ruble.
“Sooner or later, the Central Bank will realize that this strategy is not working,” Grafe said, recalling that the state plans to release the ruble into “free navigation” by the end of 2015.
But it will either have to do this earlier, or raise the key rate of the Central Bank (5.5%), he believes.
According to him, the rate of the ruble is now artificially exaggerated by 10%.
Ruble only one way - to weaken, - concludes the expert.
But if the Central Bank plunges into the financiers at least a shadow of doubt that the liquidation of the currency corridor is not part of the policy of weakening the ruble, it may collapse the ruble much more strongly.
The Second Congress of the Peoples of the South Urals was held in Chelyabinsk.
The Forum is dedicated to the Day of National Unity, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of Russian statehood and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution of Russia.
The congress was attended by delegations from all cities and districts of the region, representatives of national cultural associations, religious denominations, legislative and executive bodies - a total of about 350 people.
The course of the forum is aimed at strengthening inter-national agreement.
We can set an example here not only to other regions, but also to other countries.
We don’t have differences and disagreements.
We live in complete mutual understanding,” says Theofan, Metropolitan of Chelyabinsk and Zlatoustovsky.
During the meeting, a number of issues were considered, including the upbringing of patriotism, cultural cooperation.
As a result, the Congress passed a resolution.
The informal part of the forum continued in the theatre of opera and ballet.
An exhibition of national and cultural associations of the Chelyabinsk region was opened here.
Snowden is ready to “cooperate” with Germany on the issue of U.S. intelligence
Edward Snowden, a U.S. intelligence officer, said he was ready to go to Berlin to give testimony to the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director, Keith Alexander, were unable to answer questions about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met with Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum to discuss his testimony in Germany.
A letter from Mr. Snowden, which the deputy presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, said: "Although the result of my efforts was clearly positive, my government continues to treat dissent as treason and seeks to criminalize political statements with criminal defenses that do not give any.
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In a letter, Mr. Snowden said he believes support from the international community could persuade the U.S. government to drop criminal charges against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Germany’s interior minister, told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is willing to talk to German officials, we will find ways to make this possible.”
Relations between the United States and Germany have become tense after allegations that the NSA had tapped Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone.
Thomas Opperman, a member of parliament who heads the parliamentary group overseeing the intelligence service, said that if there is a possibility to listen to Mr. Snowden as a witness, “without endangering him or completely destroying relations with the United States,” it should be used.
Mr. Ströbele, a member of parliament from Germany’s Green Party, posted his photo with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele said that, according to a lawyer for a former NSA contractor, Mr. Snowden could not have returned to Russia if he had left.
If Mr. Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need guarantees that he would be “safe” there, the MP said.
Mr Snowden said in his letter that he faced a “hard and constant” persecution campaign that forced him to leave his home.
However, he said he was encouraged by the global response to “his political statements.”
Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking officials — including in the United States — have found the disclosure of an uncontrolled system of pervasive surveillance to be beneficial to society.
The letter proposes to cooperate with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved.”
Frontier Airlines will charge for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers up to $100 for carrying hand luggage on board their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, though their announcement on Wednesday said passengers would be able to leave the entire bank.
The new fee for hand luggage applies to bags in the upper luggage compartments, so small bags placed under the seat will remain free of charge.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if the fee was paid in advance, and $100 if travelers would only pay at the landing gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O’Malley said the $100 fee should make passengers pay in advance.
“We don’t want to charge for it,” she said.
Airlines began charging for the first and second bags, which were left in their luggage, in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these charges pack as much as they can in the hand luggage compartment, which is why these compartments often do not have enough space.
Fees are one way to make passengers carry less on board.
O'Malley said this new collection isn't really about making money.
The fact is that the most loyal Frontier customers say that finding a place in the upper luggage compartments is becoming increasingly difficult.
Passengers who purchase tickets on the airline’s website will not have to pay.
This means that one passenger in the queue at the exit of the Frontier flight may be able to carry the bag for free, while the next passenger in the queue may pay $100 for the same bag.
O'Malley said the change in procedures on the website and at Frontier's check-in counters was meant to ensure that passengers would be aware of the charge before they land.
The new Frontier manual deposit fee will not start charging until summer, although the date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage fees and other fees, but airlines love them.
They argue that the handling of luggage is worth the money, and passengers who need this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street consider the addition of baggage charges a sign that airlines charge enough money to cover the cost of air travel after several years of losses.
However, most of them did not cover the fees for manual storage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first handbag charge three years ago, and another Allegiant Air discounter later followed suit.
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the additional fees.
According to his estimate in the December 2011 report, the collection for manual deposits brings Spirit $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines top manager, recently flew a Spirit flight, and he was wondering what he would find at the landing gate when passengers encounter an unusual Spirit collection for hand luggage.
“The landing process was the smoothest I’ve seen in my career with airlines,” he said.
I was expecting to see a toothbrush and a fight at the landing gate.
The plane was full, he said, “and the landing went fast.”
Frontier also follows Spirit in terms of a $2 fee for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
Frontier said that passengers who receive soda or juice can leave a whole can and that coffee beans will be provided free of charge.
It will continue to distribute water for free.
US Airways tried to charge for drinks for a short time in 2008, but declined to do so seven months later, after passengers began to complain and no other major airline followed suit.
The Frontier initiative to charge for hand luggage when passengers do not buy tickets directly from the airline is its latest move to attract customers to its website.
Airlines pay online ticket sellers, such as Orbitz, between $10 and $25 for each ticket sold.
This gave all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them, rather than contacting an online travel agency.
However, Frontier went further in this area.
In September, she began giving twice as many frequent flyer bonus miles to customers who bought tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she cut the premium number of miles to 25 percent from miles of travel.
For example, a 1000-mile trip from Frontier, purchased from an online travel agency, would allow you to get 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can choose a seat in advance only if they buy tickets directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in her hometown of Denver, but her business is shrinking and becoming unprofitable.
Revenue fell by 9 percent, and flight opportunities fell by almost 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic is trying to fix Frontier’s finances as part of the airline’s sale.
NSA blames “internal error” and not hackers in the termination of the site
The National Security Agency said on Friday night that shutting down their website for several hours had caused a technical failure, not hackers, according to the network.
"NSA.gov was unavailable for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during the scheduled update," the agency said in a statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
Statements that the work interruption was caused by a distributed denial-of-service attack [DDoS] are incorrect.
Earlier this evening, online server monitoring systems reported that the NSA’s website hadn’t worked for at least six hours, and the site was still unavailable to some users.
Earlier, the NSA representative told ABC News that the agency’s internal secret network “nothing” was hacked.
No classified information is in jeopardy, the representative said.
At least one online group of activist hackers said it was responsible for shutting down the NSA’s website via a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to engulf the target site with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site fails.
The tactics of hackers are relatively simple, and attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
Previously, the super-secret NSA, once nicknamed "No Such Agency", has been in the center of public attention and harsh criticism in recent months after a series of revelations about its extensive surveillance programs abroad and inside the country.
The growing controversy around the agency has sparked speculation that today’s incident was the result of targeted actions by hackers.
Bombardier’s profit declines with falling deliveries and number of aircraft orders
Bombardier, a Canadian manufacturer of planes and trains, said on Thursday it had cut net profits by 15 per cent under the impact of declining orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contract problems in its rail division.
The Montreal-based Bombardier company also did not release any flight test data for its latest CSeries aircraft and did not provide new information on whether ambitious plans to put the aircraft into commercial service by next September will be implemented.
After the first flight of an experimental aircraft, which took place about one and a half months ago, it flew only three more times, which raises questions about whether the test stage is on schedule.
The results did not meet the forecasts and led to a decline of more than 8 percent in shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, on Thursday lowered his valuation from “higher-than-average” to “middle-market” due to the belief that stock growth is limited in the next quarter or two.
“Although the decline in aircraft deliveries was generally predictable, we are certainly disappointed by the transport department’s earnings figures,” Doerksen said in a stock market review.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the flight test program continues.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we assume that the market will become more skeptical of the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family of aircraft will allow it to gain a place in the lower price segment of the market, where Boeing and Airbus now dominate.
The first prototype of the aircraft was presented in March and made its first flight in September after several months of delay.
However, firm orders for the CSeries are not yet too many – 177, as potential buyers are waiting for flight test results to verify the company’s claims about the fuel efficiency and potential cost-effectiveness of the new liner.
Currently, there are 403 orders and agreements with 15 customers and operators.
Chief Executive Pierre Baudouin was confident that Bombardier would achieve its target of 300 firm orders by the time the first aircraft was put into commercial service.
On Thursday, the leaders also assured analysts and the media that the program is moving forward as planned.
"The test model of the aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected," Bodouan said during a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned for the aircraft's downtime.
All manufacturers plan tests in different ways.
We decided to take the first flight and take a break for updates, so we did.
This will be the case throughout the flight test program.
The second of the five test samples is due to fly in the coming weeks and all the rest will soon follow, the company said.
Yet analysts are skeptical that the first customer will be able to start operating the CSeries aircraft 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier said it is assessing the timing of commissioning and will provide new information in the next few months.
“This slow pace of flight testing — albeit apparently in line with Bombardier’s internal schedule — reinforces our view that commissioning will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerxen said.
In the third quarter ending September 30, Bombardier’s net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.
Adjusted earnings per share remained the same – 9 cents.
Gross income declined slightly, from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected a 10-cent profit per share and gross income of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said it delivered 45 aircraft per quarter, down from 57 in the previous year.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The portfolio of orders of the aerospace department amounted to $32.9 billion as of September 30, unchanged from December 31.
“In the aerospace field, the results were in line with our goals, but the small number of incoming orders and general market conditions have become an unpleasant factor,” said Bodouan.
Gross revenue in the aerospace direction fell by 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest train manufacturer, said gross revenue in the sector rose nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The portfolio of orders in the transport division amounted to $32.6 billion as of September 30, which is slightly higher than the figure of December 31.
The revenues of the transport unit were negatively affected by the problems with the execution of several large contracts.
The management said a new development plan would be presented in the fourth quarter.
The shares of Bombardier, which also announced that Google Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pitchett would join the board of directors, fell 8.5 percent to $4.83 at a mid-Thursday trade.
Brazil’s Embraer SA, the world’s third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier’s closest competitor, said on Thursday it had cut quarterly revenue by 10 percent.
Sony expects lower annual earnings
The Japanese electronics manufacturer, Sony Corporation, ended the past quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, cut its forecast for profit for the current fiscal year.
Sony’s July-September 2013 results were more depressing than expected due to the drop in demand for televisions, camcorders and personal computers manufactured by the Japanese corporation.
Sony’s television business, which brought the company its first operating profit in three years of 5.2 billion yen, fell again to 9.3 billion yen of operating loss in the reporting period.
The Japanese consumer electronics market is experiencing difficult times, especially due to the declining demand for televisions.
And while competitors are keen to find a way out of the difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of the main rivals of Sony, Panasonic Corporation, has recently shifted its focus to industrial components: here, the company’s sales are growing at a high rate, especially due to automotive systems and environmentally friendly technologies.
As a result, by the end of the fiscal year, which will end in March 2014, Sony expects to receive 179 billion yen of operating profit against the previously expected 230 billion yen.
At the same time, according to Thomson Reuters, analysts assumed that this figure will be significantly higher and will amount to 221 billion yen.
In an effort to get out of the crisis, Sony is expanding its product line.
In the middle of this month, it was announced the start of the sale of "smart" watches from the Japanese corporation, endowed with a number of fashionable features that will eliminate the need for 100 times a day to take out of the pocket of a smartphone.
After Sony lowered its annual earnings and revenue forecast, the company’s stock lost more than 11% in the morning at the Tokyo Stock Exchange opening, falling to the level of 1,668 yen per share.
The gene of speech proved to be a stimulant of the formation of synapses
Scientists from Johns Hopkins University and Mount Sinai School of Medicine have discovered a protein through which the Foxp2 gene performs its function by stimulating the formation of new connections between neurons.
The study is published in Science, on the website of the journal you can read its brief content.
The Foxp2 gene is the first known gene whose function is directly related to speech.
His role was established in 2001 thanks to the discovery of a family of several people who could not pronounce the words correctly and sometimes did not even understand each other.
Scientists found that family members had been disrupted by the Foxp2 gene, but how it performs its function was not known.
In a new study, biologists have shown that at least some of their functions Foxp2 performs as a stimulator of the formation of new synapses in the area of the brain associated with the formation of speech.
It does this thanks to another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was discovered as a result of the search for factors that stimulate the formation of synapses.
SRPX2 proved to be one of the 10 similar genes found by the authors, with Foxp2 only blaming for its activity.
The fact that SRPX2 really affects vocalization, the scientists confirmed in the experiment on mice.
When the animals had artificially reduced gene activity, they screamed less when shared with the mother.
If the gene activity was restored, the frequency of the emitted sounds was also restored.
Previously, mice also showed a connection with the vocalization of Foxp2 itself.
Animals that were injected with a human copy of the gene ate more actively and at a lower frequency than normal mice.
Until now, however, scientists do not know whether the work of Foxp2 and, accordingly, the SRPX2 managed by it is related to purely "mechanical" properties of sound formation or to more subtle processes.
A cocaine-addicted lawyer who warned the head of a criminal group about a police investigation is jailed
42-Year-Old Basharat Ditta Passed Information to the Criminal Authority of Neil Scarborough
The lawyer feared that his secret drug addiction would be revealed.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Royal Court of Liverpool.
A prestigious lawyer who told the drug baron about a major police investigation because he was afraid of revealing his secret drug addiction was jailed for three years.
The 42-year-old Basharat Ditta has leaked to the criminal authority of Neil Scarborough secret information about an investigation into his drug trafficking activities after being threatened because of his cocaine dependence.
The lawyer, nicknamed Bash and nicknamed a “cool lawyer” among criminals, was arrested at his home in 2011 after a police surveillance operation on Scarborough, which he previously represented in a drug court.
Officers noticed the 32-year-old Scarborough left three bags of cocaine at a lawyer’s home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was at a dinner at a law firm with colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Ditta “regularly used” a class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, wallet, and credit cards.
For eight months from January to August 2011, he attempted to illegally obtain information about the arrests of two people on behalf of Scarborough, as well as one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were under police supervision at the time as part of a large-scale investigation into the activities of a criminal organization selling heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Cambria, Merciaside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were later jailed after police seized <0xC2><0xA3>1.5m in heroin and cocaine raids and more than <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 in cash.
The 42-year-old Ditta was passing on information to criminals because of fears that his cocaine addiction would be exposed.
Today at Liverpool Royal Court Ditta, who works at Forbes Solicitors, a law firm based in Blackburn, was shamed after acknowledging his guilt in two cases of deliberate obstruction of justice by a three-week court in Liverpool.
He confessed to cocaine possession at one of the previous court hearings.
The lawyer’s disclosure came after police investigating Scarborough’s activities found out that he had been talking to Ditta on a regular basis on the phone since February 2011.
Two detectives tracked down the suspect and found him approaching Diett’s house in Blackburn and placing 60 percent pure drugs in a black golf glove under the lawyer’s trash cans.
Shortly after the broadcast, Scarborough repeatedly called Ditta, who was at a dinner at the Blackburn Rovers' Ewood Park football stadium.
The lawyer returned home for the drugs; nine conversations took place between them.
The court learned that Ditta had "regularly used" cocaine after tests found traces of the class A drug in his hair, wallet, and credit cards.
Dietta was later arrested, but denied using cocaine, said he had spoken to the suspected dealer as he was his client, and insisted their communication was a “lawyer’s secret.”
During his detention, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards, but all of them were confiscated, and he also had a hair sample taken.
During a police interrogation, he said that along with the workplace, he had a home office and clients came to his house for legal matters.
However, the court learned that after important arrests, he called the largest drug traffickers, a number of whom he had previously represented in court, to tell them that detectives knew about them.
In her indictment, White said: “If anyone knows that the law should not be violated, it is a criminal lawyer.”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer because he has entered into too close a relationship with certain clients.
The contact we're talking about is not just a drug dealer, it's a drug dealer supplying his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations will certainly turn out to be legitimate, as he was their lawyer.
However, this has largely crossed the boundaries of the usual relationship between a lawyer and a client.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as possible to allow these individuals to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta didn't honor his profession, he dishonored it.
He became too close to certain clients, in particular Scarborough, and allowed himself to be questioned about his uninterestedness.
Dietta pleaded not guilty and said: “If I were a corrupt lawyer who I am not and would like to pass on information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately.”
But after the meeting, senior officer Lee Holstead of Lancashire Police said, “Mr. Ditta turned from a criminal lawyer into a criminal criminal as soon as he started buying drugs from organized crime.”
His addiction to cocaine made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the purposes of the main participants of criminal groups, who commissioned him to extract valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must follow the highest standards of professional ethics and inspire trust and confidence in society.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to cover up his profession.
Mr. Ditt ' s investigation was conducted by Lancashire ' s Specially Dangerous Organized Crime Unit, which had already sentencing him to three cocaine storage cases and now to obstruct justice, demonstrating our commitment to achieving a just punishment for criminals.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is outside the reach of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
Another 35 people involved in the drug trafficking were sentenced to 153 years for drug-related crimes.
On his website, Ditta organized a question-and-answer interview, in which he says that his dream job is a lawyer representing clients with a death sentence in America, the perfect companion for him at dinner – Mohammed Ali, and the motivation at work is inequality.
The stadium in Yaroslavl is not ready to receive 22,000 spectators, said police officers, who were present today at the meeting of the KDC of the Russian Federation.
The ticket program is overpriced, in their opinion, about twice.
During the match 1/16 of the final of the Cup of Russia with "Spartak" was engaged only a thousand stewards at the norm of nine thousand.
Spartakovsky fans were given 2,200 seats, that is, 10 percent of the stadium capacity, but, according to an agreement with the Moscow club, they were sold 5,000 tickets.
This data was announced by the head of the KDC Artur Grigorjanz.
The Americans were listening to Japanese high-ranking officials
On Friday, November 1, a U.S. intelligence official who chose not to reveal his name said the U.S. had been wiretapping phone calls from high-ranking Japanese officials.
This person confirmed that in the country of the rising sun there are several points intended for listening.
At the same time, he noted that the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand do not conduct intelligence activities against each other.
This was the case during the Second World War, when these countries were allies.
But Japan, as well as Germany, despite allied relations with the Americans in the post-war period, are objects for intelligence activities, NHK reported.
Officially, neither party has yet commented on this information.
We will remind, news about the surveillance of the U.S. special services by the Chancellor of Germany appeared last week.
According to German journalists, the NSA has been able to listen to Merkel’s phone for the past ten years.
The Chancellor herself, according to some reports, took the news of her audition very painfully.
She said that the allies she believes are Germany and the United States for decades, such an observation of the head of government is unacceptable.
Meanwhile, Edward Snowden said he was ready to share details of Angela Merkel’s phone conversations with German prosecutors.
The German specifically flew to Moscow to meet with a former CIA employee.
Bashkiria may put the grain to tender not before the beginning of 2014
In the course of state procurement interventions, Bashkiria can put grain for auction not before the beginning of 2014, according to the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic Nikolay Kovalenko.
To date, market prices are such that they do not stimulate sales to the intervention fund.
While the price in the market is higher, there is demand.
"Perhaps the grain will be put up for auction after the New Year," he said at a press conference yesterday.
The Minister recalled that in the current year the crop of agricultural crops for the harvest of 2013 amounted to 3.1 million hectares, including the area of cereal crops - 1.7 million hectares, which is 3.3% more than last year.
For the 2014 harvest, 550 thousand hectares were planted (by 105,000 hectares more than in 2012).
Increased area for winter wheat and triticale, raisin remained at the same level.
In the bases of the Ministry of Internal Affairs there is no group "Brother's Circle", to which in the United States was assigned Leps
In the databases of the Russian security forces of the group "Brother's Circle", to which Washington attributed the singer Gregory Leps, is not listed.
According to Interfax in law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation, after the media reported on the introduction of the U.S. Treasury Department Gregory Leps on checklists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate "Brother's Circle", all databases were checked, but such a group
The dissemination of this information contributes to maintaining the myth of the so-called "Russian mafia", which allegedly operates abroad, according to law enforcement agencies.
Even in the very name - 'Brother's Circle', there is some element of mystery, there is a hint of a secret lodge.
“All this is very similar to a PR action,” the agency’s interlocutor said.
On October 31, the U.S. Treasury Department announced the inclusion in its checklists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate "Brother's Circle" Arthur Badalyan, Grigory Lepsveridze, Vadim Lyalin, Sergey Moskalenko, Yakov Rybalsky and Ygor
The individuals on the list are suspected of having ties to some Vladislav Leontiev and Gafur Rahimov, who are considered influential members of criminal groups and have been on U.S. sanctions lists since February 2012.
According to the American authorities, Grigory Leps "serves as a courier for the delivery of money on behalf of Vladislav Leontiev."
At the production center of Grigory Leps refused to comment on the US accusations against the singer, calling them "foolery".
In 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama named the Brotherhood syndicate “substantial transnational organized criminal groups” and instructed the Treasury to “undermine and ban their global criminal operations.”
The blacklisting of a person by the U.S. Treasury involves blocking his assets in the U.S. and banning business contacts with people living in the U.S.
Scandalous video went to the police
Toronto head Rob Ford, known for his scandalous and frankly reckless outbursts, found himself smoking crack.
Police in the Canadian city said they have a video and are ready to begin an investigation against the mayor.
He said he would not leave his post, CNN reported.
Information that the authorities have evidence of drug use by Rob Ford, appeared on the Toronto police website.
The head of local law enforcement, Bill Blair, held a press conference on the matter.
The sheriff said he was not authorized to share the data with the public, but he is responsible for their existence.
According to Blair, the compromising Rob Ford video was found during an anti-drug raid carried out by guards in the summer of 2013.
Earlier, the existence of this video was already written by the Canadian press, but until recently there was no confirmation.
The mayor himself makes no comment on this.
He just says he's not guilty of anything and he's not going to resign.
The video, discovered by police, is one of the evidence in the case of 35-year-old friend Ford Alexander Lisa, who is accused of trafficking in light drugs, extortion, illegal income, and criminal conspiracy.
At times, Lisa served as Rob Ford's driver.
The city has long demanded the resignation of its mayor.
He repeatedly fought with journalists, appeared in public in a drunken form, allowed himself racist and sexist statements.
JSC Rostovaeroinvest recognized the German company Assmann Beraten + Planen as the winner of the tender for the selection of the general designer of the facility.
The amount of the contract in Rostovaeroinvest is not disclosed.
According to the press service of OAO, nine Russian and foreign companies participated in the competition, under the terms of the tender, the project should be prepared and sent for state expertise in the spring of 2014.

At the first stage of construction, the internal area of the terminal will be 50 thousand square meters, in the future it is possible to increase it.
According to Rostovaeroinvest, the project documentation will take into account the prospects for the development of the airport complex: by 2025, the terminal will be able to serve about 5 million passengers, and by 2035 - 6 million passengers.
At the time of summing up the tender results, the architectural concept of the airport complex "South" was determined, which was developed by the British company Twelve Architects.

A politician in Turkey has declared a hunger strike against the wall on the border with Syria
In mid-October, authorities began construction of a partition wall in the Nusaybin area of southeastern Turkey.
Local residents and representatives of the pro-Kurdish PMD party strongly opposed the construction.
The mayor of the Turkish city of Nusaybin, Ayshe Gekhan, on the border with Syria, declared a hunger strike, protesting against the construction of a partition wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, RIA Novosti reported in the press service of the Peace and Democracy Party (PMD) on Friday.
Police have repeatedly dispersed the protests.
Turkish Foreign Minister Muammar Güler first denied the fact of construction, then said that the wall is being built to ensure border security.
“The mayor of Nusaybin, Ayshe Gekhan, a member of the PMD, declared a hunger strike, thus turning his protest against the construction of the wall into a deadly struggle,” the party’s press service said.
The mayor of the city believes that the construction of the wall is designed to isolate the Kurdish population of the two countries from each other, the Kurds crossed this border freely for half a century.
“This is an inhumane situation that the Kurds will never agree with,” the party’s Aisheh Gekhan said.
According to the press service, on November 7 in Nusaybin, it is planned to hold a rally against the construction of a partition wall.
Venezuela to set exchange rate for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate of its national currency - the Bolivar - against the dollar for tourists.
This was reported by Bloomberg on November 1, citing a government decree.
Foreign travelers will be allowed to exchange amounts equivalent to ten thousand U.S. dollars per year.
Venezuela will also allow tourists to sell up to 25 percent of the bolivars purchased in the country at the time of departure.
The specific exchange rate of the Bolivar against the dollar will be set at a later date.
In February, Caracas was forced to devalue the local currency to 6.3 bolivars per dollar.
However, in the black market, one dollar is valued at 57 bolivars.
Since the beginning of the year, the bolivar has lost almost 70 percent of its value.
In September, inflation in Venezuela was almost 50 percent.
On October 18, oil industry minister and vice president of economics Rafael Ramirez said Venezuela had no plans to devalue the bolivar.
According to unofficial information provided by the agency, Caracas may still decide to lower the national currency after the municipal elections in December.
The policy of restraining the prices of products and consumer goods, as well as the high degree of regulation of the Venezuelan economy, led to the shortage of a number of goods and the functioning of the black currency market.
In the spring of this year, the media wrote that there was a shortage of toilet paper in Venezuela.
Director of Jugra Andrey Belmach noted that it is difficult to say how long it will take to find a new head coach.
This position became vacant after the resignation of Sergei Shepelev.
The resignation took place just a few hours ago, so to say how long it will take to find a new coach, I am not ready, - says Itar-TASS words Belmach.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We are looking at all possible options.
Priority will be given to the Russian specialist.
I do not just want to find a coach, but a person who will work in our club for several years and achieve certain results with him.
The Kenyan press is outraged by the provocative law on the media
“This is a terrible place, and there is reason to ask: what can prevent Parliament from destroying the independence of the judiciary in the future?”, the newspaper said, calling the law unconstitutional.
“This law is very harsh and punitive, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group, a parent company of CapitalFM, which includes one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio stations and a news website.
He said the new media judiciary “will always be biased as it is a continuation of the government,” and restrictions on content and advertising would hurt Kenya’s position in the global economy.
“I hope the president will listen to us and we are asking him to reject this bill and return it to his deputies,” he said.
According to The Star, the new law would essentially allow the government to “take the media by the dead hand” and The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya had “taken a serious blow” and criticized the bill as “dragonous.”
The passage of the bill is part of measures taken to strengthen national security following the September attack by Muslim terrorists at the Westgate shopping mall.
Kenyan media has sparked anger from authorities by broadcasting surveillance footage, where troops who were sent to the site of the attack allegedly robbed an expensive shopping mall.
Police chief David Kimayo’s reaction was to summon two journalists and a media official for questioning, although the summons was cancelled after mass media protests.
Under the new law, publishers can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings, and individual journalists - up to one million with an additional risk of being "excluded from the lists", that is, to be banned from receiving official journalist accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the offender’s property if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “even one fine is enough to paralyze the work of most FM radio stations.”
She also reported that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya’s so-called “living blogosphere.”
Politicians understand that by forcing the media to remain silent, they will be able to do whatever they want with impunity.
“No one will ever know,” wrote Nation journalist Mutuma Matthew, characterizing Kenyan media as a key source of deterrent and balancing forces in public life.
“The politicians themselves will destroy the country and bring us back to hunting and gathering,” he wrote.
Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of public anger in the past.
In May, they voted to lift the cuts appointed by the National Salary Commission and restore their huge salary of about 532,000 shillings a month, not taxed, to one of the highest in the world.
In the utility bills of Voronezh will appear a new line of expenses - deduction for capital repair of the house.
According to the most approximate calculations for a standard one-bedroom apartment from the new year will have to pay from 100 to 400 rubles per month.
The exact norm will be determined by the government of the region.
But when to paint the entrance, to put in order the stairwells or even to replace the elevator - will decide the residents themselves.
Such a law was approved by the deputies of the regional duma.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, Chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, noted: "In this case, too, it is necessary to bring order - to establish the order of repair of houses, to accumulate funds not in the managing companies - which we often register the funds in Moscow, then in Orenburg, then elsewhere, it will be established.
Under the control of the state now and partial construction.
The law protecting against fraud is approved by the Oblduma in the final reading.
The document was not born in an empty place.
In our region, 4,500 people have been affected by dishonest developers.
Most of the problems have been solved.
By the way, the new law prescribes rights and obligations for all participants in the share building.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, Chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said: "It is no secret that abuses have also begun in this sphere, due to the fact that in 98 the same shareholders fell, and in the 2000s the same shareholders fell."
People started making money on it to cover the loophole, including adopting these two laws.
Under Voronezh it was decided to build a temporary residence center for foreign citizens subject to deportation.
The regional parliament passed such a law not only under the pressure of the federation.
The problems associated with illegal migrants in the region, at least, get rid of them.
Last year, a little more than 100,000 foreigners were registered for migration.
However, only one in five has a work permit.
Where others work and whether they pay taxes is a big question.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, Chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said: "They have violated the law, but they are not criminals."
There is no court, and they have to be deported - they have to be held somewhere.
Such a decision the federation made that at the expense of regional funds such places to equip.
In the Voronezh region, such a place is defined as the Old Olshanka of the Semiluk district.
Well, finally, the regional parliament has granted new benefits to many children's parents.
First, families raising five or more children are exempt from the transport tax.
The budget in this case loses 3.5 million - but the same is saved by many parents.
Secondly, and this is the main thing, those who adopt 3 or more children, from the new year will issue subsidies on housing.
For each member of the family, the new law provides for 18 square meters, at a price of 30 thousand per meter.
The family, for example, of 6 people - dad, mother, child and the 3rd - adopted.
For them, according to the norms, the state acquires housing of 108 square meters - for 3 million 300 thousand rubles.
For the left bank or the South-Western microarea - quite an acceptable option.
Well, in the district center for this amount you can buy a whole cottage.
Baumgertner nominated to the board of directors of Uralkali
The current board of directors of JSC Uralkali has proposed the candidacy of the arrested in Minsk CEO Vladislav Baumgertner to the new board, according to the website of the Russian company.
Bamugertner was included in the list of 11 people nominated for the new board of directors.

Later, however, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said at a press conference that Baumgertner’s accusations were reclassified as “rape.”
Gatekeeper "Petrochemical" Matt Dalton refused to comment on the departure of Vladimir Krikunov from the post of mentor of the Nizhnekamsk people.
Golkiper believes that the acting head coach Dmitry Balmin enjoys great authority from the players and will cope with his duties.
Recall, today "Neftekhimik" resigned Krikunov.
To be honest, I would not like to comment on the dismissal of Vladimir Krikunov," Dalton told RIA Novosti.
I can only say that Dmitry Balmin will cope with the obligations imposed on him - I have no doubt about it.
In the team he enjoys great authority, this young specialist is definitely waiting for a great future.
Juventus defender Leonardo Bonucci will not help the team in the upcoming match of the championship of Italy with Parma.

According to experts, these measures can bring to the budget an additional 619.3 billion rubles.

U.S. Secretary of State: Secret Service Sometimes ‘Goed Too Far’ in Data Collection
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry admitted that when collecting data and wiretapping, U.S. intelligence agencies sometimes “go too far,” but the politician noted that the information about the wiretapping 70 million people appeared in the media did not match the reality.
I assure you that innocent people were not harmed in the process, but the attempt to gather information was.
Yes, in some cases it went too far and was illegal.
I acknowledge this, as the president acknowledges ... and we will make sure that this does not happen in the future," the secretary of state quoted AFP as saying.
Italian workers with experience give way to young people
Unemployment in Italy is breaking records.
Data published on Wednesday showed that 12.5% of the country’s residents are now out of work.
Things have not been so bad since the Second World War.
Among young people, this figure is several times higher.
40.4% of the population aged 15 to 24 have no employment.
According to the Italian authorities, one of the solutions to this problem is early retirement of older workers.
Such an experiment is already carried out by the largest energy company of the country, and the adopted laws allow the regional authorities to provide part of the early retirement for workers with experience.
However, on the other hand, Italy is facing a common problem of an aging population for Europe.
And economists aren’t sure that starting with premature rotation of staff justifies itself.
What will lead to the construction of TPU in Moscow
Every year, the capital authorities promise to equip more and more transport and transfer hubs (TPUs).
By 2020, 255 TPUs are planned to be put into operation.
What the project is really about, our correspondent understood.
A couple of months ago, a construction fence was built near the Smolensk Arbat-Pokrovsky Line subway.
The inscription said that the transport and transfer node was being arranged.
All this was very strange, because next to "Smolenskaya" no ground transport stops and, therefore, it is impossible to transfer to it.
To get to the nearest trolleybus stop on the Garden Ring, it is necessary to overcome about 130 meters, including the ground crossing through the Karmanitsky Avenue.
Now Smolensk is almost finished.
The flowerpot disappeared, the newspaper stand was dismantled, and the asphalt before the entrance was replaced with barbed wire.
Here's the whole transport hub.
Transport and transfer hubs are flat and capital, - explained in the press service of the Metropolitan Department of Transport.
There are no TPUs yet.
And the flat ones involve the construction of parking lots, the removal of commercial facilities that hinder the movement of passengers, the creation of small architectural forms and improvements.
In fact, flat TPUs are not even engaged in transporters, but professional benefactors from the capital repair department of the city of Moscow.
The transport hub is not necessarily a complex construction, - explains the director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the Higher School of Economics Mikhail Blinkin.
Sometimes there is enough roof over the head and a sign indicating the time of arrival of the transport.
Here, for example, at the metro "Yasenevo" recently opened a fully-fledged flat transplantation node.
No canopies, but with intercepting parking and a sign indicating when the bus will arrive.
But in pursuit of the number of officials record in the TPU everything that gets caught.
Back in 2011, the city planned to build all 151 hubs, 59 of them with capital construction.
Now in the plans until 2020, there are as many as 255 TPUs.
One and a half of them are expected to be delivered this year.
Although there is a TPU development program in the city, there are no quality criteria, - says Alexander Morozov, co-chair of the public organization "City and Transport".
They are accounted for by the number of objects, but the quality of transplantation on each of them often deteriorates.
According to the expert, there should be two criteria: firstly, the reduction of transplant time, and secondly, convenience.
First of all, it is possible to change the mode of transport without going into the rain.
In Moscow, when setting up a TPU, sometimes the opposite happens.
A striking example of the VDNH subway.
Previously, suburban buses from Yaroslavskogo highway came to the square in front of the main entrance to the air force.
Now their stops moved to the opposite side of Yaroslavka to the street Cosmonauts.
Farther from the subway, much further from the monorail, but closer to residential houses.
It was a gift that the residents did not want a bus station under the windows and complained to all possible instances.
With the capital TPU in Moscow somehow did not immediately start.
The first of them began to build five years ago at the subway "Planernaya".
The project was intended to be exemplary.
And it really turned out to be a sample of how the transplant node, given to investors for ransom, turns into a banal shopping center.
No, there are railings for buses, a canopy not to walk from the subway in the rain, and three floors of parking.
However, the chemical trolleybuses No. 202 and No. 203 in the Moscow TPU were not given places in principle.
Like strangers, they were pushed away from the subway.
But there is still room for trade.
There are only 32 clothing stores, and in general there is almost everything - from pets to the car showroom.
In fact, which of the passengers of the bus will need to buy a new car on the road?
When we build a capital TPU, for some reason there is always a shopping center.
Recently, the situation reached its logical conclusion when part of the parking lot was decided to give up under the market.
Now on the third floor of TPU "Planerna" among the marked on the floor parking spaces is a boycott trade.
Vegetables, spices, Chinese jeans, non-Russian speech and guards who look maliciously at our photographer.
The transplantation node has finally turned into a bazaar.
The fact is that before the subway "Planernaya" had a market, but it was demolished.
And in the prefecture, the merchants were sorry and allowed to intercept the parking lot of the transfer center.
However, due to the high prices, it is always empty.
The funniest thing is that the market was demolished in order to build a new flat TPU in its place.
That's the way it's written.
At the metro "Kaluzhskaya" the distance of approach from the metro lobby to the bus was 50 meters, - says Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of the shopping center, allegedly TPU, the distance increased to 170 meters.
To get on the bus, you need to go through the entire shopping center.
After 22 hours, when it is closed, you have to bypass it under the open sky.
However, the structures on the "Planarna" and "Kaluzhskaya" will soon appear flowers.
In mid-September, the city-building and land commission of the city approved planning solutions for the first eight capital TPUs.
Four of them will be 25-storey, excluding two or three underground tiers.
The main monster will grow at the Tushino metro, it will have 418.7 thousand square meters.
Representatives of the Directorate of Railway Stations of the Russian Railways, responsible for the construction of the TPU at the subway, have already told journalists: in the future multi-storeys will be located shops, hotels and apartments.
At the same time, officials say that multi-storey car parks are mute from a third to half of the square.
Take, for example, the "people's" garages.
Let’s say a garage for 258 car seats, which was recently built on International Street, has an area of 8015 square meters.
So, for parking for 2,6 thousand cars at "Petrovsko-Razumovsko" will need about 80,000 "squares".
That's less than a third of the car they're going to build.
Let one or two floors go to all sorts of perrons for buses.
There are at least 150,000 square meters of commercial real estate.
And this, for a minute, almost two rubbers.
If the main TPUs at the stations and stations are built by railway companies, then the rest of the platforms will be mastered by metropolitan residents.
They also promised that there would be many “functional facilities,” including hotels, offices, and even gyms.
By the way, in the property department of the city of Moscow recently told journalists that they are developing a draft resolution, according to which investors will be able to apply for a site for TPU to officials directly.
Without any competitions.
Therefore, please note that transport issues for the city are a priority.
The ideal TPU is, for example, the "Harvard" station in Boston or the "Spadaina" station in Toronto, - Alexander Morozov is sure.
There trolleybuses and trams descend underground to the subway level and the approach distance from the subway to the tram is only 50 meters without access to the street.
There is no over-trade.
But Moscow officials are thrown to the extreme.
Either we're not going to build anything, or we're going to tear down 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Esser proposes to equate insulting patriotic feelings with extremism
For the legislative protection of patriotic feelings of citizens from provocations and insults directed against Russia, Fair Russia proposes to equate the insult of patriotic feelings to extremist activity and punish it for five years in prison.
According to the newspaper "Izvestia", such amendments to the legislation, prepared by the deputy chairman of the Duma Committee on Energy Oleg Mikheev, are already sent to the Supreme Court and the government for an opinion.
Under the patriotic feelings of citizens, the author of the amendments proposes to understand the emotional connection of the person with the country of which he is a citizen, characterized by a love for that country, a responsible attitude to its fate, respect for its history and culture.
According to Mikheev, there are sanctions in the domestic legislation for abuse of the formal features of state power - the flag and the coat of arms.
At the same time, in the opinion of the parliamentarian, the protection of Russians, whose feelings can be affected and insulted by state symbols, and other manifestations of disrespect for our country, is not sufficiently worked out in Russian legislation.
As an example, he gives the annual Victory Day discussion, when some media figures allow themselves to question the heroic feat of the people of the USSR in the fight against the fascists.
On the eve of the main public holiday - Victory Day on May 9 - a real vacchanalia is held annually.
Exercising in wit and an "alternative view" of history, some publicists come to the conclusion that, to put it bluntly, the cultural Germans did not conquer the savage Soviet Union!
I consider it absolutely unacceptable in a country where pride in history remains the main "spiritual anchor" of the nation," Mikheev said.
In addition, according to Mikheev, patriotic people in Russia are much more than religious, but the law punishes for insulting the feelings of believers, and insulting patriotic feelings can be almost with impunity.
In the opinion of the elected representative, it is necessary to equate the insult of patriotic feelings to extremist activity and to prescribe in article 282 of the Criminal Code the corresponding punishment.
The bill provides for a punishment for insulting patriotic feelings: from a fine of 100,000 to a 5-year prison sentence.
The 6.6-magnitude earthquake occurred on Thursday, Oct. 31, near the city of Coquimbo in central Chile, Reuters reported.
The focus of the earthquake was in the ocean at a depth of 10.7 kilometers and at a distance of 54 kilometers southwest of the city, according to the website of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).
The impulses were recorded at 20:03 local time (3:03 on November 1 in Moscow).
There are no reports of casualties or of destruction caused by underground impulses.
Recall that Chile is located in one of the most seismoactive areas of the Earth, so earthquakes of different strength are not uncommon there.
One of the most serious incidents occurred in 2010.
The earthquake of magnitude 8.8 and the tsunami caused by it led to the death of more than 550 people in Chile and the destruction of 220,000 buildings.
In addition, Chile experienced the most powerful earthquake in recent history: in 1960, it recorded a magnitude of 9.5.
More than 5,000 people died as a result of the disaster.
Dmitry Medvedev: Greenpeace case will be treated fairly
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev on Friday said that the case of Greenpeace activists will be considered in strict accordance with Russian law.
France may not doubt that the case will be considered in compliance with the law, we hear all the concerns.
"We can guarantee compliance with the laws," Dmitry Medvedev said at a meeting with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ero.
Among the detained Greenpeace activists is a French citizen.
Pierre Pisani, like the rest of the activists, has been charged with hooliganism.
“I asked if we could expect a humanitarian gesture towards the detained citizen,” RIA Novosti quoted Mr. Ero as saying.
“Our country cannot support activities that can harm the environment, no one has the right to violate the laws,” Dmitry Medvedev said.
According to him, the activities of any structures that try to influence technologically complex and unsafe processes, including energy production, are dangerous.
He stressed that these objects “like a powder keg” and recalled what was happening in the Gulf of Mexico, reports RIA Novosti.
UN announces new poverty-reduction targets
The United Nations should immediately begin work on a new set of tasks to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were formulated 12 years ago to overcome poverty worldwide.
Australian diplomats played a key role in advancing “sustainable development goals” to replace the MDGs, which expire in 2015, before the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began in Rio de Janeiro on the eve of the evening.
They were included in the final version of the document to be signed by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the summit’s participants that it was now time to “be above national interests.”
“I am pleased that the UN member states have agreed to launch and take control of the process of creating universal sustainable development goals – SDGs,” he said.
These SDGs will build on our progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and will become an integral part of the post-2015 development concept.
I will make every effort to use the powers given to me by member countries to realize our vision of sustainable development goals that build on the successful implementation of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing as a result of the conflict of influential people
Under the top-down statue of Samora Machel, the founding president of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to chant peace slogans at one of the rare demonstrations here.
“We want peace back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, executive director of the investment company.
Fearing for the future of her country, she changed her business suit to a T-shirt decorated with the inscription “We Demand Security” in Portuguese, and joined the crowd on Thursday in the capital’s Independence Square.
For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government troops and Renamo — one of the most brutal clashes since the truce was signed more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a well-known rebel movement, which was supported first by the white authorities of Rhodesia and then by the apartheid-era South African government as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 truce, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to revert to a full-scale conflict, but recent events have made foreign investors and local residents nervous.
The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy, as the discovery of huge shelves of gas and coal deposits in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion in investment over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the US.
The ruling Frelimo Party, the leading political force since 1975, and the Renamo Party blame each other for the tensions.
The Renamo party claims that the government has been the source of the latest clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofia, the traditional Renamo stronghold, on October 17.
The attacks on former rebels then escalated as government troops attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakamu, the group’s leader, Renamo’s spokesman Fernando Mazanga told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for initiating the clashes, accusing the party of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Gebuza tried to dispel concerns about the instability.
Gebuza told AFP on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama felt “a failure” to use “everything left of his power to try to prove that he can impose his own decisions on the government.”
Both Frelimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid war.
However, concerns grew after Mazanga announced that Renamo had renounced the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the Financial Times that he meant non-compliance by the Frelimo party.
“Our goal is to return to the negotiations, but with all seriousness,” Mazanga said.
Previous negotiations between the parties have done little to ease the tensions that have been exacerbated by a series of clashes this year.
“These are two influential people (Gebuza and Dhlakama) who have come face-to-face,” said Joseph Hanlon, an Open University lecturer and expert on Mozambique.
Neither of them is a good negotiator and neither of them is ready to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo party, which is trying to achieve electoral reforms, has already said it will boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted this pressure as an attempt by the weakened movement to obtain concessions and financial bonuses from the government.
The share of votes for Renamo has been declining since 1992, while the new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was founded by a former member of Renamo, is expected to improve its performance in these elections.
Mr. Mazanga says that Mr. Gebuza, who is due to resign next year, when his second term ends, wants to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn’t want multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to leave the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is not clear what capabilities Renamo has, but it has already carried out devastating and rapid attacks on police stations and cars on a key highway leading from north to south.
Most of the clashes took place in the province of Sofia, which is a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but includes Beirut, a port that mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, use to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of the railways for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway.
Mazanga was evasive when asked if Renamo would repeat the threat.
The Renamo party wanted to “warn the international community that things are not going very well in Mozambique,” Mazanga said.
The instability has heightened government dissatisfaction, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and recent kidnappings, said Fernando Lima, head of independent media company Mediacoop.
“People think that the responsibility for the future of the country lies with the government and the president, who must find a solution to these problems,” he said.
Omar Sultan, a participant in the demonstration, said that people just want stability.
“Nobody cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want to restore peace, they want free access to roads,” he said.
The series of premiere film shows "Art-Mainstream" will be held in Moscow
A series of film shows "Art-Mainstream", where viewers will be able to see one Russian and four foreign films a few days before their release, will be held in the cinema "Rolan" from November 1 to 5, reports RIA Novosti with reference to the organizers of the project.
The program "Art-Mainstream" will be opened by the French comedy director and actress Reim Kerichi "Paris at all costs".
This is the story of a model working in the French capital, Maye (Kerichi herself), who is deported to Morocco due to visa problems.
In addition to the Kerichi film, viewers will also be shown a new picture by the famous South Korean director Kim Ki Duka "Mebius", a melodramatic biopic by Oliver Hirschbigel "Diana: A Love Story" (Diana) with Kahmi Watts in the lead role.
The only Russian participant of the "Art-Mainstream" will be the winner of the film "Kinotavre" Alexander Veledinsky "Geograph the globe wasted" on the grounds of the novel of the same name by Alexei Ivanov.
The main role - the charming failure-teacher Viktor Sluzhkin - in the film was played by Konstantin Habensky, whose work was also marked by the prize "Kinotavra".
Children should study myths and legends as “lifestyle models,” says the author.
The tales of the Torah could show that “brute force cannot overcome subtle cunning,” and the legends of King Arthur show how important it is to have a dream.
Saying that many myths will turn out to be “too savage, too scandalous, and in some cases too indecent to teach in schools,” Crossley-Holland advocates “careful selection” of age-appropriate texts.
“I think it’s wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I advocated introducing them into the curriculum for twenty years.
He added that the “excessive moralization” of authors and teachers “reflects the interest” of children, and the main ideas are “sublimated” into fascinating stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated "Beowulf" from the Anglo-Saxon language and also wrote "The Collection of Norwegian Myths" for the publisher Penguin and "British Folk Tales", said: "You may have intentions, of course, but you better keep them to yourself."
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an adult author who writes for children is the need to feel some hope.
It is not that everything should be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but it is necessary that there be an innate understanding of good and evil.
And it must be sublimated; revealed through history, not clearly formulated.
The old principle is to show, not tell.
In Voronezh region detained a football fan who broke the window in the waiting room of the station
At nine o'clock in the evening of October 29, two football fans - natives of the Moscow region - were removed from the passenger train by the Voronezh transport police at the Grias-Voronezh station.
Going to the game of your favorite team, the guys on the way arranged a drunken deboss in the train.
Young people were taken to the duty station of the line office of the police at the station of Gryazi to draw up a protocol on administrative offences.
There, the fans repented of their anti-social behavior.
The police issued administrative material on them and released them.
Young people bought tickets for the next train and at the station began to wait for his arrival.
In the middle of the first night, fans left the railway station building, but one of them, a 22-year-old boy, suddenly returned and broke the front window of the station waiting room with his foot.
On the bell of the broken glass plunged a transport police officer and a guard of the police force "RZD".
They were able to arrest an attacker who was trying to escape from the scene.
Employees of the South-Eastern LU of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia are being checked.
The question of initiating a criminal case is being raised, said Sergey Olkhovyk, senior referee for information and public relations of the Southeastern Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia on transport.
Vitaliy Mutko: Waterworks?
I think we're back 15 years.
Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko expressed his opinion on the riots at the stands during the match of the Russian Cup "Shinnik" - "Spartak".
I am in favour of the organizers of sports events: clubs, leagues, the Russian Federation.
But we see that they have taken a strong position.
They are waiting for someone from the side to come and get things right.
This is a very good position, but not quite right.
We have to organize fans, clubs should invite their stewards, not let the business go on its own.
We have now drawn up a special government decree on the rules of conduct in stadiums.
Once it is adopted, we will deal with this issue closely.
But I will definitely invite all the organizers of the football process.
I read an interview with Leonid Fedun.
State, please, let the law come quickly.
The feeling that it was the fans of "Bavaria" in Yaroslavl came and arranged it all.
We are outside observers.
And it's really terrible to see the stands being watered from the fire pit.
And this is in a country that is preparing for the World Cup.
“I feel like we came back 10-15 years ago,” Mutko said.
Snowden could be interrogated in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence official Edward Snowden is unlikely to travel outside Russia to testify on the wiretapping of German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone conversations.
A source familiar with the situation told Interfax on Friday that the American could answer questions from German prosecutors in writing or in person in Russia.
Edward Snowden’s departure from Russia is virtually excluded.
“In this case, he will lose refugee status and may be extradited to Washington by countries that are allies of the United States,” he said.
"At the same time, in principle, the German Prosecutor General's Office could send its representatives to the Russian Federation or pass on written questions to Snowden," the source added, adding that this issue should be worked out at the interstate level.
Earlier, the deputy of the German Bundestag Hans-Christian Streichel said that Edward Snowden is ready to give testimony on the case of the wiretapping by the US special services of the negotiations of the chancellor of Germany.
Snowden is ready to testify to the German law enforcement authorities either in Moscow or on the territory of Germany.
An ex-CIA employee has made it clear that he knows a lot.
Despite the fact that the US NSA blocked all of his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, for this, it is necessary to clearly define all the conditions of his arrival," Strechle told Euronews.
Snowden’s lawyer, Anatoly Kucheren, commenting on the Interfax source’s statement, said his client could cooperate with German investigators, but would decide when and how.
U.S. citizen Edward Snowden, who worked for the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, after which he disclosed information about the secret operations of U.S. intelligence services for online surveillance.
Snowden flew through Moscow in transit, but was unable to leave the airport due to the fact that his passport was cancelled by the US authorities, who in absentia brought him serious charges, and remained in the transit zone of the Sheremetyevo airport until the beginning of August.
On August 1, Snowden received a document granting him temporary asylum in Russia for a period of one year and on the same day left Sheremetyevo.
Yesterday, the lawyer of the American Anatoly Kucherena said that his client has settled for a job in a "large Russian company".
The NSA's surveillance of Angela Merkel last week was reported by the German media.
According to journalists, the phone conversations of the chancellor of the United States began to be heard in 2002.
The tracking station was reportedly located at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin.
The German authorities, after the publication of this information, said that the surveillance for Merkel violates the laws and sovereignty of Germany.
Ponomarev left "Just Russia"
The deputy of the State Duma from the party "Fair Russia", a member of its office in Novosibirsk Ilya Ponomarev filed an application for withdrawal from the political organization.
As the parliamentarian said, he submitted a statement to the Novosibirsk regional office of the party.
According to its charter, this automatically means that Ponomarev has left the ranks of the "right-wingers".
We sit down, drink tea...
"For some reason, many want to see the picture "Ilya Ponomarev puts a party ticket on the table", but there is nothing so epochal about it," the deputy commented on his decision.
Ponomarev noted that he maintains good relations with the regional branch of the "Essers".
Meanwhile, the mandate of the deputy of the State Duma Ilya Ponomarev does not intend to refuse.
He explained that despite leaving the party, he remains a member of the faction and cannot legally leave it.
Reports of the intention of Ilya Ponomarev to leave the party "Fair Russia" appeared on October 30.
It was reported that Dmitry Gudkov and Valeriy Zubov would leave the "SR" with him, but the latter soon denied this information.
Japan will discuss with Russia the issue of the conclusion of a peace treaty
Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kisida met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
"We would like to openly exchange views on the further development of political dialogue, discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty," Kisida said at the meeting.
The Japanese Foreign Minister recalled that after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited Russia, relations between the countries became warmer and took on a bilateral character.
The Russian minister, in turn, noted that the Russian Federation will go to meet Japan in solving complex political issues, writes RIA Novosti.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies a solution to the question of the disputed Northern Territories.
In this regard, there are protests in Tokyo today demanding to return to the country the land lost after the Second World War.
In the Japanese capital there are cars, from which the loudspeaker reports: "Return the northern territories!".
The police do not stop the protesters, they make sure that the noise level is not exceeded.
Ben Greenman: The 10th Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It is safe to say that New York is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, stage artist Frank Fay, who worked at a conference at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the public in a conversational way.
Faye’s innovation has been picked up by others, most recently the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and curated by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Carolines stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
“Most of these headliners started at Carolines, and then they were more successful, they reached a level where they were already too famous to perform at the club,” Hirsch said.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year’s event includes performances by Wanda Sykes, Katie Griffin and Bill Mara, as well as “Standup for Heroes” – an annual music-comedy charity concert for military veterans at Madison Square Garden, where they will appear, among others, Bruce Springsteen, and Johns.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy has expanded.
Several comedians participating in the festival this year have gained popularity in a non-traditional way, for example thanks to shows on small TV channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Croll gained fame for his role in the comedy series on the little-known cable channel (particularly the scurvy FXX-themed "League" on fantasy football), and now runs his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate joined the cast of both “Saturday Night Live” and “Parks and Recreation Areas”, although she is best known for the series of viral videos “Marcel is a shell in shoes”.
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with a distinctive style (surrealistically pessimistic Anthony Jesselnick, villainous, focused on the racial theme of Camau Bell), are the result of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the highlights of the festival will be David Steinberg’s interview with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but later became a successful director on television and in film, as well as an unofficial comedic historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he was the host of a TV Land show called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will take place in the Town Hall in downtown Manhattan.
“This city is definitely the central element of all Larry’s work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he comes here, he sometimes walks down some street between the two houses and thinks, “Well, if I’m out of money, maybe I’ll live here.”
Pakistani authorities begin talks with local Taliban
The Pakistani authorities have begun talks with the Taliban.
This was reported by the embassy of this country in the United Kingdom, where Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif is on a visit.
The head of Pakistan's government made a statement on talks with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British Vice Prime Minister Nick Clegg, with whom he discussed issues of Pakistan-India relations, the world energy market and economic reforms in Pakistan.
"The prime minister has said that dialogue with the Taliban has begun," the Pakistani embassy in London said in a statement.
"He said he hopes and prays that dialogue will work in accordance with the Constitution of Pakistan," the diplomats added.
The Pakistani Taliban (Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan) are allies of the Afghan movement of the same name, but operate independently of it in the northwestern regions of the country bordering Afghanistan.
The Pakistani Taliban are seeking the establishment of an Islamic State.
The Islamabad government had previously made attempts to start talks with the local Taliban, but the movement refused to engage in dialogue.
It said it would only enter into negotiations if the authorities moved troops to permanent deployment sites in areas where the Taliban operate, and also freed detained Islamists from prisons.
Nawaz Sharif arrived in London for the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, 29 October, British Prime Minister David Cameron, the head of the Pakistani government and Afghan President Hamid Karzai held a tripartite meeting in London to discuss the prospects for a peace process in Afghanistan.
The price of oil fell to $96 per barrel.
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday, as concerns over the formation of large inventories overshadowed a report showing that China’s energy-intensive manufacturing sector is gaining momentum.
The benchmark U.S. oil grade in December’s supply fell by 14 cents, and its price was $96.24 per barrel in the late morning European time in electronic auctions on the New York Commodity Exchange.
On Thursday, the contract fell by 39 cents, which amounted to a fall in the price for October by 5.8 percent.
Rich oil reserves have affected its value in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. stocks have increased by 4.1 million barrels over the past week.
In five weeks, the stockpiles were replenished by more than 25 million barrels.
But on Friday there was an indication of a possible increase in demand, judging by two reports about the Chinese industry, which showed a surge in its activity.
This indicates that China’s economic recovery may continue to gain momentum after its third-quarter growth rate rose to 7.8 percent after a 20-year low in the previous quarter.
Brent oil, a benchmark international oil used by U.S. refineries, fell by 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel on the Intercontinental Exchange in London.
Colorado head coach Patrick Rua, explaining the decision to release goalkeeper Semen Varlamov from the first minutes in a Friday match with Dallas, expressed confidence that the recent night behind bars did not shake his confidence in the Russian, reports Natala from Dallas.
"What are we waiting for?" said Rua after the morning roll of Lavin.
Of course, what happened bothers us all, but we are confident in him and feel that it will be useful for him to go out on the ice today.
We want him to go out on the ice and show his usual level.
So you're completely sure that the situation has not affected the conditions of the goalkeeper?
We'll see today.
Undoubtedly, our players will support Varley by helping him keep the goal, as they did in previous games this season.
The main thing is that no one in the team is going to draw any conclusions until the court understands this situation.
In Siberia, you should not be a vegan: a greenhouse tomato will not replace a soup
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for life in Siberia, RIA Novosti found out.
People who have completely given up on animal products should not live in Siberia.
Here, they can not endure the winter without loss of health, and no greenhouse tomatoes will compensate them, according to Novosibirsk dietitians and doctors interviewed on the eve of Vegan Day.
Drinking oil in liters
Strict vegetarianism, when they give up not only meat and fish, but also milk, honey, eggs, becomes a fashionable way of life.
However, nutritionists are convinced that in Novosibirsk and other cities of Siberia to adhere to such strict norms in nutrition, at least, is not beneficial for health.
The complete abandonment of animal products is harmful.
Animal proteins contain essential amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate for by plant.
It is necessary to include in the diet at least milk or eggs", - is sure dietitian Marina Bogay.
It gives an example of fish that contains an indispensable fatty acid Omega-3.
Their richest vegetable oil is flaxseed.
"To consume it in the necessary quantities for a person, you need to drink in liters!" - says the dietitian.
Doctors believe that the inhabitants of Siberia should pay special attention to the diet in winter.
This season, vegetarianism is particularly questionable.
In the conditions of our realities, there are high demands on food.
In order not to freeze, you need an increased calorie.
"If a person restricts himself to animal products, respectively, he does not eat this calorie," - says the specialist.
This is the opinion of dietitian Olga Pozniak.
She adds that imported vegetables and fruits are not a way out.
It is better for a person to eat mainly products that are grown in the region of residence or where he was born.
The genetic code is designed for better absorption and digestion of these products.
And in winter, people do not want to bite the cucumber, but a hot soup or something more saturated," - explains the doctor.
According to her, from what can be eaten by vegans, really useful are various grains, cereals, legumes, local vegetables, apples remaining in the winter, frozen berries.
But this is clearly not enough for a full diet.
According to gastroenterologist Claudia Arifulina, the level of vitamins in Siberian organisms is sufficient only from mid-August to mid-September.
A complete transition to vegetarianism in our harsh natural conditions, when the temperature can change by 30 degrees in a day and in May snow is lying, is not appropriate.
The body needs energy for life, and this is, first of all, fat," the doctor states.
Doctors note that veganism is especially harmful for children and pregnant women.
Children grow up, they need building material, including in the form of amino acids.
And by adhering to vegetarianism, we give them undervalued.
Pregnant women also need an increased content of protein, vitamins and micronutrients in the menu.
"Vegans don't get them," God is sure.
Arifulina says that an adult is free to choose anything, "to play the toys that he wants."
He has already formed an organism, a skeleton, organs.
The children should eat well, though.
If parents deprive him of any trace elements or amino acids, choosing for him what he will eat, it is simply a violation of the rights of the child.
“The lack of certain substances for the development of the brain, vision, bones will not recover tomorrow,” she says.
All the medical specialists interviewed agree on the low quality of winter crops grown in greenhouses and imported vegetables and fruits.
What is brought to us and grown in greenhouses contains less micronutrients than (grown) in open ground.
"The quality of the products is not that," says God.
Arifulina also notes that imported and greenhouse vegetables and fruits are far from ideal standards.
Sometimes the desire of the producers to harvest more crops is detrimental to the quality.
“Apples don’t turn brown on the cut, cucumbers quickly yellow and moldy, tomatoes tasteless and unfragrant,” medics say, adding that they are likely to be teeming with excess fertilizers.
And they become suppliers not of vitamins, but of fiber.
This is not agreed with the laboratory of the Siberian Physical and Technical Institute of Agricultural Problems, Candidate of Agricultural Sciences Vera Petruk.
She says that with the right approach and compliance with all the norms and requirements in greenhouses, it is possible to grow full-fledged vegetables.
If you try to expel more from a square meter, then, of course, watering will become more frequent, and refeed the plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when there are too many nitrogen fertilizers, tomatoes grow quickly, they are large but watery and unsweetened," she explains, adding that the quality issue depends primarily on the conscience of the producer.
The court suspended the execution of the decision on the practice of “stop-and-search” in the New York Police Department
On Thursday, the Federal District Court of Appeals suspended the execution of a court order requiring changes to the New York Police Department’s “stop-and-search” program, and suspended the judge from the case.
The U.S. Second District Court of Appeals said the execution of Judge Shira Sheindlin’s rulings would be suspended until the results of the city’s appeal.
In August, the judge ruled that the city violated the constitution in how it carried out a program of street arrests and interrogations.
The city filed an appeal against its decision and resolutions on corrective measures, including an order to appoint a controller to help the police department change its work practices and associated training programs.
On Thursday, the appellate court heard the parties' debate on the application for suspension of the case.
The appellate court said it needed a judge’s dismissal because it violated the U.S. Code of Conduct for judges and did not consider it necessary to avoid showing bias, in part because of a series of media interviews and official statements containing a public response to the court’s criticism.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by unreasonably addressing blacks and Latinos under the “stop-and-search” program.
It has appointed an external controller to oversee large-scale changes, which include policy, training and control reforms, and has decided to launch a pilot program to test body-mounted video cameras at the police stations where the majority of detentions take place.
In August, New York decided to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases were stopped after a police check.
The city’s appeal hearing is due to take place after March 14, 2014.
The “stop and search” tactic has been criticized by many civil rights lawyers.
“Stop-search” has been practiced for several decades in one form or another, but the number of documented stops has increased sharply under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching an absolute record of 684,330 people in 2011, most of whom are black and Latino.
In 2004, four people, all from national minorities, filed a class action lawsuit.
Proponents of the “stop-and-search” changes in the New York Police Department say these changes will put an end to unfair practices, form a more reliable and effective police service, and can affect how other police departments implement the practice.
Opponents argue that the changes will reduce the fighting spirit of the police rather than the level of crime, will lead to unnecessary spending of money and will not solve the more global problem of complex conditions in the police due to the reduction of the number of officers by several thousand in the last decade.
The judge noted that she does not stop the practice of “stop-and-search” that is consistent with the constitution, but changes the way the New York police stop people.
In the area of Tretyakov Gallery opened a pedestrian zone
There is a new pedestrian zone in Moscow.
It is located in the area of Tretyakov Gallery and occupies a site two kilometers from the metro station "Novokuznetskaya" to Bolotnaya Square.
All along are installed street lamps, flower beds, benches, urns and toilets, removed deaf fences and illegal advertising.
In addition to the Klimtovsky and Lavrushinsky alleys, which were already pedestrianized, five streets were closed to cars - Ordinsky Stupik, Big and Small Tolmachevsky alleys, Kadashevskaya embankment and Bolotnaya Square.
The traffic on the streets of Maroseyk and Petrovka is not limited.
On the section of Pyatnitskaya Street from the lobby of Novokuznetsk station to Klimentovsky Avenue, conditions for pedestrians were created without removing the traffic and cutting the passage, reports newsmsk.com.
Inside the pedestrian zone were the Tretyakov Gallery, the Church of the Martyr Clement of the Pope of Rome, museums, libraries, monuments and other attractions.
Previously, Tver Proezd, Stoleshnikov Alley and Kuznetsky Most Street were completely pedestrianized.
Greater Dmitrovka, where the pedestrian zone opened in early September, it is decided to close for cars on weekends and holidays.
Coulson resorted to hacking the phone to verify confidential message
The former editor of News of the World, Andy Colson, allegedly used “phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation” in an attempt to confirm false information about the novel by Charles Clarke, who was then the interior minister.
The prosecutor, royal attorney Andrew Edis, told the Old Bailey court that in May 2005, News of the World received unreliable news that Clark was meeting with his “attractive special counsel” Hannah Polby.
The newspaper commissioned private detective Glenn Mulkey to hack into Polby’s voicemail and watched her at home for an interview, but Coulson also called her and left voicemails, the court heard.
“The prosecution believes that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the kind of person who will stand by someone’s house hoping to find someone by surprise, he’s the kind of person who likes to offer a story to people to see what they’re going to say,” Edis said.
He said the News of the World used three ways to investigate stories: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Apparently, he knows about the second, about surveillance, he just has to.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hack?
He says no, we say, “Oh, yes!”
Rumors about Clarke’s novel first caught the attention of News of the World when a source sexually interested in Ms. Polby said, “Don’t waste time, she’s with Charles.”
A tape of voicemail messages received from her phone at least three times was removed from Mulkey's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on a private detective’s computer that depicted Ms. Polby and her sister as “Projects.”
During the period she was under surveillance, Ms. Polby's grandmother and grandfather received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr. Eddy said.
At that time, former chief reporter Neville Turlbeck and former reporter James Weserap were monitoring Mrs. Polby's movements.
Leaving her a voicemail on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, “I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow and that I would very much like to discuss with Charles.”
Mr. Eddys said Coulson's involvement in the story was based on the same scenario as that of other influential people, such as former Interior Minister David Blanchett.
The jurors heard on Thursday that Coulson was in a confrontation with Mr. Blanchett over a romance with a married woman while he himself was dating correspondent Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks denied collusion with other people for the purpose of hacking phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulkair, Thorlbeck and Weserap confessed to hacking phones.
Snowden declares readiness to speak with the German authorities on the case of the wiretapping
Former CIA employee Edward Snowden expresses readiness to come to Germany as soon as he has the legal opportunity to do so, and to meet with representatives of the German authorities, RIA Novosti reports.
A letter from a former CIA official to the German authorities at a meeting with journalists in Berlin on Friday was presented by Hans-Christian Strebele, a member of the Bundestag, through which Snowden forwarded the message to the German authorities.
The gunman met Snowden the day before in Moscow.
As a result of the fire on Tverskaya Street, four people were injured
As a result of the fire in the collector in the center of Moscow, on Tverskaya Street, four passers-by were injured.
According to Interfax, citing a source in emergency services, one of the victims was hospitalized.
According to the source, passers-by were injured during the fire in a smoky underground passage.
According to RIA Novosti, citing the head of the capital’s fuel and energy department, Pavel Livinsky, electricity has been completely restored in all the houses on Tverskaya Street.
The fire in the heat collector near the house 15 on Tverskaya Street occurred in the evening of October 31.
From the hatches of the rain sewer went strong smoke, and in the underground passage, located at the store "Armenia", smoke was formed.
As a result of the fire, 11 houses on Tverskaya Street were destroyed.
At 21:45 Moscow time, the fire was extinguished.
U.S. Cuts Food Benefit for the Poor
Food allowance for a family of four is reduced by $36 per month
Since Friday, the financial provision of food stamps, known as “food stamps”, has been reduced in the United States, as the corresponding state program expires.
A family of four will now be paid $36 a month less than before, officials say.
This will affect 47 million of the poorest Americans.
According to Reuters, in the 2012 financial year, the average one-person allowance was $133 per month.
U.S. food aid spending rose to $80 billion a year due to rising unemployment and food prices.
Approximately 14% of Americans rely on free food aid issued by “foodstamps” bearing that name since the time when they were in the form of paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis began, the program was expanded to stimulate economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
Republicans in Congress, however, are calling for further cuts in funding for the program, saying it should be aimed at helping those who need it more than others.
Grocery owners across America are worried that the cuts will lead to lower consumer spending.
U.S. Congressmen continue to argue about how to further reduce government funding.
Blizzard Releases 19-Year-Old Platformer for Free
Blizzard released its 1994 Blackthorne platformer for free on PC.
This is reported by WoW Insider.
According to his data, the game became available on Battle.net in the classic games section of Blizzard.
However, some gamers note that currently can download it only those users whose accounts belong to the American part of the service.
For Russian users, the game is not yet available.
According to the media, the version that Blizzard has now released on the PC does not look any different from the original version of the game.
The soundtrack to Blackthorne also remained unchanged.
The Blackthorne platformer, which Blizzard released 19 years ago, was originally released on the SNES console.
Its events took place on the planet Tuul, whose inhabitants were divided into dark and light kingdoms.
One day, the dark ruler Sarlak decided to kill the bright King Vlaros and become the sole ruler of the planet.
The main character of the game is the son of Vlaros Kyle, who was saved from death by sending him to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Tuul to fight Sarlak's accomplices and protect the inhabitants of the planet from them.
The original Blackthorne was the first game that the studio released after its renaming to Blizzard Entertainment.
It was previously called Silicon & Synapse.
The publisher of Blackthorne was Interplay.
There will be new machines in the Moscow metro.
But to sell tickets to passengers they will not be for money, but for sitting.
One trip worth 30 rubles will cost a potential passenger in 30 sittings.
The number of sittings will be counted by a special device with the help of modern technologies, reports ITAR-TASS with reference to the press service of the Olympic Committee of Russia.
The first device will be installed at the "Exhibition" station on November 8, 2013.
In the presentation of new sports machines will be accepted by the President of the Olympic Committee of Russia Alexander Zhukov and Olympic champions gymnasts Alexei Nemov and Elena Zamolochykov.
National Security Agency Recognitions Intensify Corporations’ Paranoia About State Surveillance
On a warm day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew low over the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany’s financial capital.
According to the instructions of the Federal Service for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany’s internal intelligence service, his task was to photograph the roof of the U.S. representation building, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media say the BfV hoped to detect the antennas of the wiretaps, and these actions led to negotiations between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, director of U.S. National Intelligence, reassured in September that the U.S. is not using foreign intelligence to “steal the trade secrets of foreign companies in the interest of U.S. companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their profits.”
But since Edward Snowden — a contract employee who became a whistleblower — began publishing his treasury of U.S. intelligence secrets, European governments and company executives are no longer sure whether the director can be trusted by word of mouth.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency has tracked Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to data held by U.S. cloud service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have raised the paranoia of corporations caused by state surveillance to new heights.
The last drop was the news that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone was tapped, perhaps, for about ten years.
If the most influential person in Europe can become a target, then, of course, the potential targets are also business leaders.
Snowden has made clear the intense cooperation between U.S. intelligence services and companies.
I think it is quite likely that this data is being used for mutual benefit.
“Germany needs to wake up,” says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents Germany’s small and medium-sized IT companies.
German companies are convinced that the U.S. now poses almost the same risk as China in industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published in July by the consulting agency EY.
In all the documents released by Mr. Snowden, however, there was still no evidence that the U.S. was passing on the trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacks certain information technology and Internet capabilities, and expressed the view that it should try to reduce its dependence on the US.
Business people are skeptical about this.
Someone in the German parliament says we have to create a German Google.
I can just close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“It’s not an option,” says Gasso Plattner, president of the German software company SAP Business.
If there is a need for a powerful European IT industry, it should not have been allowed to die more than 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany: from coal to cars and farmers.
Anything but the IT industry.
Yet the coverage and technical development of U.S. spy agencies, made famous by Snowden’s revelations, has been a shock to some companies that previously thought the biggest risk of surveillance was China.
A big shift is taking place in cloud technologies, where executives of European companies are better aware that data stored in the US is in the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study by the Cloud Security Alliance trade association, about 10 percent of its non-U.S. participants abandoned plans to use the services of a U.S.-based cloud provider after unveiling the U.S. program for intelligent analysis of Prism data.
Jim Snabe, one of SAP’s executive directors, said: “We see consumers asking a new question that didn’t arise a year ago, namely, where my data is stored and can you guarantee that they will physically remain in that jurisdiction?”
Many German leaders argue that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew: powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore these data must be protected at all costs.
What happens to economic espionage is not surprising.
He always had a place.
“This has been a topic of discussion for many years and has not changed significantly in the current controversy,” says Kurt Bock, CEO of BASF Chemicals.
The Americans are spying on us commercially and industrially, and we are also spying on them because it is in our national interests to protect our commercial enterprises.
Corporate leaders usually do not like to brag about the retaliatory measures they have taken, as this can give an advantage to the adversary.
Large companies have long been accustomed to the idea that taking a free flash drive at an exhibition or leaving a laptop unattended in a hotel room is, at least, careless.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of Audi’s board of directors, says it’s been a standard practice for many years to collect mobile phones before board meetings so they can’t be used as wiretapping devices.
The Federal Office for the Protection of the German Constitution recommends that company executives consider using simple prepaid mobile phones during foreign trips due to the vulnerability of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are then discarded.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many such companies are leaders in the global market in their particular niche.
“Small and medium-sized companies often lack the expertise, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access,” the report warns.
The United States warns its own companies of economic espionage by other countries.
The U.S. National Intelligence Summary in February placed France, along with Russia and Israel, in the second rank of hackers for economic intelligence, after China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of the prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Scarsini, the former head of the French domestic intelligence agency DCRI, reportedly said in an interview this month: “The services know perfectly well that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
Parents of a Georgian teenager who died by "stupid accident" believe their son was killed
The parents of a Georgian teenager whose body was found inside a rolled-up sports mat in his high school gym believe their son was killed, a family lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 in a vertically-standing matte, sheltered behind the stands in the gymnasium of his high school.
Investigations by the Londes County Sheriff’s Office have concluded that Johnson died by tragic accident, but the family of a 17-year-old teenager disputes this.
“They’re absolutely sure their son was killed,” Benjamin Kramp, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed he was dead as the sheriff said.
“They think it’s against logic, the laws of physics, and common sense,” Kramp said.
They think it’s a cover to protect the person or people responsible for their son’s death.
“They sent their son to school with a school bag and he was returned to them in a body bag,” he said.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson’s death, noting that several key questions remain unanswered.
What caused the death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore made a statement at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll study all the facts, wherever they lead.
My goal is to know the truth.
“I hold the view that there are sufficient grounds” for an official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy showed Johnson died as a result of “positional asphyxiation.”
However, the second autopsy, according to Moore, revealed another cause of death.
“There are a few issues that need to be resolved or clarified,” he said.
Moore added that if he finds enough evidence to require a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson’s death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
A spokesman for the Londes County Sheriff’s Office was not available for comment when he was approached on Thursday.
A judge in South Georgia on Wednesday ordered authorities to publish all the surveillance camera footage that investigators were viewing.
The teen’s parents said they hope the videos contained the key to finding out how he died.
"Spartacus": For information about persons who displayed fascist symbols
On the official website of "Spartacus" there was a statement of the Moscow club regarding the appearance on the stand in Yaroslavl of the fascist flag.
"At the Cup match "Shinnik" - "Spartak" on October 30, unknown provocateurs at the stadium in Yaroslavl demonstrated fascist symbolism.
We appeal to all who have reliable information about the persons who committed this criminal offence, with a request to provide it to the security service of FC "Spartak-Moscow" at the e-mail address fcsmsec<0x40>spartak.com.
“Reward is guaranteed,” the statement said.
We are looking for fans who hung the fascist flag in Yaroslavl
Recall that in the match 1/16 of the final of the Cup of Russia "Shinnik" - "Spartak" several times interrupted due to riots on the stands.
Also on the sector of fans "Spartacus" was demonstrated fascist symbolism.
In the form of punishment "Spartacus" can hold about three matches without spectators.
A committee meeting will be held on Friday.
If you have information about who carried and hung this symbol, please contact us.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Issued Recommendations for Schools Concerning Allergy in Children
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a list of recommendations for controlling food allergies in children in schools.
This is the first list of such recommendations issued by the U.S. government, while the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is growing.
One in 20 children in the United States has a food allergy.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the prevalence of food allergies among children increased by 18 per cent from 1997 to 2007.
The guide provides information for schools on how to raise the awareness of teachers and service staff about food allergies in children and how to provide assistance in the event of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools keep adrenaline supplies—most often for injections, the automatic medical syringe EpiPen is used—to help with potentially deadly anaphylaxis.
The state legislatures recently amended the regulations to allow schools to make adrenaline supplies with less difficulty.
The notification also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children who have had an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “a feeling like something is going on in my tongue,” “a feeling that I have hair on my tongue,” or “a tongue pinch.”
Parents of intersex children can choose “undefined sex”
Germany became the first European country to recognize the third sex in children born with external intermediary sex organs.
Newborns will no longer be assigned male or female sex.
The new law does not require parents to name any gender of such children, allowing parents to indicate gender as “undefined” or “undefined” in their birth certificates.
The purpose of the law was to relieve pressure from parents who can make hasty decisions about a sex-assignment operation to newborns, and to counteract discrimination against intersex people.
One intersex man, according to the BBC, said many years later, “I am neither a man nor a woman.”
I will remain a doctor-created shiny product with bruises and scars.
About one in two thousand children born annually is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have intersexuality, one of about 60 pathological conditions that fall under the diagnosis of “sexual development disorders” – a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or seminals) or unusually developed external genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
Gender identification has not yet been sufficiently studied, but most experts in the U.S. say that if the gender cannot be determined, it is better to use all available information and attribute it than to wait and monitor the child's psychological and physical development before performing the operation, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Dresher, who specializes in gender identification issues, said the new German law “sounds like a good idea.”
Intersex children create an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening disorders that require surgery, but most children don’t,” he said.
You can assign sex without surgery and then watch how the personality develops.
The science of how a child develops a gender identity is not very accurate.
No one can answer the questions about why this is happening.
It’s like a mystery about why people are gay.
The report, sent to the European Commission in 2011, describes intersex people as being different from transgender or transgender because their condition is not related to gender, but to their biological structure, which does not correspond exclusively to either male or female sex, and is typical for both at the same time.
These characteristics may be manifested in secondary sexual features such as muscle mass, hair distribution, breast and physique; primary sexual features such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides a general understanding of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the level of harassment, cruelty and prejudice-based crimes.
Boys with gender anomalies now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to put a male, female or “third sex” in their official documents.
In June, the 52-year-old Australian resident Norrie May-Walby became the first person in the world to be recognized as “genderless”, defending in court the right to maintain “unspecified” sexual status for life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, the German passports will use the third designation in addition to M and F - X, that is, intersex.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still causing controversy, according to a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators from France, a vibrant Catholic country, signed a petition to remove “gender theory” from school textbooks.
The American website Catholic Online also voiced disagreement with German law, writing that “in a situation where the world is drawn into a new state where sex is the subject of choice and sexual activity is not, we are reversing two more pillars of civilization.”
A mother of a newborn baby from Maryland also told the Baby Zone website that she would prefer to have the babies have sex at birth.
“Growing a child is quite difficult and without additional restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s gender,” she told the website for parents.
Children need stability and self-confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female genitalia were called hermaphrodites - after the beautiful Greek god who had features of both sexes.
And just ten years ago, the medical community perceived gender as a sheet on which you can erase everything and then draw it again.
But now many are challenging the ethical grounds for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors sometimes make the wrong choice, not knowing how the child will perceive the sex assigned to him when he grows up.
“In the middle of the 20th century, this was called an ‘emergency psychiatric case,’” Dresher said.
When such children were born, you didn’t call a psychiatrist – you called a surgeon.
The dominant theory on how to treat children with intermediate-type genitalia was proposed by Dr. John Manny of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender is easily changeable.
He coined the term “gender identity” and argued that environmental, including social, signals — how parents raise a child — interact with the child’s genes and hormones, determining whether a person will consider themselves a man or a woman.
But in one case in 1966, known as John/Joan, his theories were questioned.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis was damaged during negligent circumcision, to completely castrate the child, also removing his testicles, and to grow him as a girl.
“Mani presented the case as a successful example of the transition, but it wasn’t,” Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he became a boy again and married a woman.
At the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Dresher said that some doctors are still “applying this model.”
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, people who survived these sex reassignment operations declared themselves “unsatisfied with the result.”
This was the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male XY chromosomes but intermediate-type genitalia.
The doctors could not determine exactly whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that he would never be able to live a “full life” of a man.
Therefore, shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce’s external genitalia and testicles were surgically removed, and he was raised as a girl.
He was given female hormones at the age of 12.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he was given a vaginoplasty.
But being depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he demanded medical records.
What he found out was terrible.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder that did not allow his body to produce enough testosterone for normal genital development.
Having learned the truth, he became a man again, receiving injections of testosterone and removing his breast.
The operation made him infertile.
Today, he defends others in an organization called the Interface Project, trying to normalize the perception of people with intersexuality.
But Ann Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the California legal association Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that German law “encourages the imposition of labels and stigma.”
"Many activists are concerned that German law will prompt parents to make a hasty decision and give the child an 'unspecified sex,'" she said.
We fear that it will contribute to the intervention.
We believe that it is better to assign a male or female sex, and then wait.
But we have not yet seen how this law will manifest itself, so all we can do is make assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because “it allows adults to make choices in favor of the third sex.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about formal sexuality,” she says.
The German law implies its appropriation at birth.
This is a battle that young children should not enter at this stage.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh-based mammologist and radiologist who has a daughter with a sexual development disorder and who helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said the German law would “support” both parents and children.
Barac’s daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a sexual development disorder called “complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.”
Because its androgen receptors work incorrectly, Katie has developed female signs.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and ovaries.
At the age of 29, Katie is married and holds a paediatric psychiatry degree at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogacy.
“The law gives parents time not to make hasty decisions on their own,” Barac said.
It gives them time to do some analysis and figure out the situation, as well as a period of time before they write “male” or “female”.
In this case, you are fine - raise a child, love a child.
You have a wonderful child, and you feel joy.
We don't have to rush into an operation that's irreversible.
“It allows children to participate in the decision and eliminates the excitement that drives parents because they don’t feel they’re doing the right thing,” she said.
In the end, the child will decide which sex he or she is more comfortable with — and that’s great.
This gives children the opportunity to make their own decisions.
Chicago goalkeeper Nikolai Habibulin stressed: he understands that he should play better.
According to the 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard on training.
In the last two meetings of the Hawks, Habibulin first missed six reels from Tampa Bay, and then four from Ottawa, and in the second game he was replaced after the fourth missed reel.
We have to play well, and in the last two games I have not managed to do that, - says CSNChicago words Habibulin.
“I need to find confidence in training, I think it’s worth approaching them as games and trying to achieve a better result.
You have to study your past games and work on the shortcomings that have been.
There are a few small components that I need to improve, but in training I feel quite decent.
But for some reason, after a few heads, everything turns into some kind of snowball.
Maybe I need to relax a little.
The goalkeepers - I don't think I'm the only one - always try to play the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I'm not thrilled.
It doesn’t matter what happens at my door.
I'm still working on myself so I don't miss out on so many drives.
It’s great that my teammates support it, but in principle it’s simple: I have to play better.
“Two games are not the whole season, but I wanted to spend them much better.
But what happened happened.
I have to put this aside.
I'm just going to try to play the next game better.

Medvedev expects that the aircraft SSJ-100 will be delivered to Europe
Russia expects that after being consolidated in the markets of Latin America and Asia, the Superjet 100 aircraft will also be delivered to Europe.
"We expect that in total we will receive such agreements for more than 170 aircraft of this type," said Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev at a press conference with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Eau.
The head of the Russian government noted that serious cooperation has been established with French colleagues, as it is a joint project.
We discussed some financial issues related to insurance today, but we hope that once this aircraft is strengthened in the Latin American markets and in the Asia-Pacific region, it will also be delivered to our partners in Europe.
"I hope that one day it will be delivered to France," the Russian prime minister stressed.
SSJ-100 is an aircraft built by Sukhoi Civil Aircraft Company in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
The liner is developed on the basis of modern technologies and offers high standards of quality and comfort in the segment with 100 passenger seats.
Energy companies of Dnipropetrovsk have started a unique program to save... nests of aisles
In antiquity, to bring to the court of the Aistos, the peasants on the high pillar installed a wheel from the wagon, and the heavy nest was well held on it.
Such special supports have not been put in place for a long time, so the aists loved the pillars of the power lines - the intertwined branches rest on the wires, thanks to which the real house stands securely.
Grandmother Anya, whose real family has lived in the village of Ivanovka in the Petrikovsky district for twenty years, began to notice how the nest settles, despite all the efforts of its inhabitants.
The birds put new branches on top, and the lower layer has already passed between the wires, it is about to collapse.
Of course, it is a pity that the family of aesthetes, who each year nested in the yard, raised and fed three or four chicks during the summer, but also without the light do not want to remain without it.
As soon as the birds flew to the warm areas, Grandma Anja called the Tsarichan Reservoir, which owns the support.
I didn’t expect them to react so quickly.
When our specialists arrived in Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest is still holding at all, - said the technical director of DTEK "Dneprooblenergo" Sergei Berezovsky.
On the wires, which were, in fact, already inside the nest, weighing 150 - 200 kilograms, corrosion began.
At any moment, the birds could die from electric shock.
And the locals risked to run out of light because of the damage to the wires.
Therefore, the linear mounters started the operation to rescue the nest, and not for the first time in our practice.
Scientists-ornithologists from Dnipropetrovsk National University, who developed a scheme for the transfer of the nest, helped.
They also conducted trainings for employees of district networks.
Famous Dnepropetrovsk ornithologist Alexander Ponomarenko advised energy engineers at all stages of the reconstruction of the nests.
For the first time, it was estimated that there are more than 50 real "apartments" in the area in an emergency.
For their reconstruction, special metal platforms resembling a funnel were welded.
The base was weaved with spruce branches, and then transferred there the old nest.
According to experts, it is enough to lay the old branches as a basis for the birds to recognize the nest and return to it.
Afterwards, the Aistahs build their own houses.
A month ago, the first nest was reconstructed in the village of Peschanka in the Novomoskovsky district.
Next to the electrical support was placed a new concrete pillar and placed on it a platform with an old, already inhabited nest.
The entire operation cost the energy engineers nine thousand hryvnias.
And the other day, the same settlement took place in the village of Ivanovka in the Petrikovsky district in the courtyard of Grandma Ani.
Here the platform was fixed in the same place, only raised above the wires.
Ornithologists are sure that cautious, conservative birds will not even notice in the spring that their "apartment" has undergone major repairs.
By the end of the year, the same reconstruction awaits four more nests in the Pokrovsky and Tsarichan districts of Dnipropetrovsk.
By the way, while some save rare birds, others mercilessly kill them.
The other day, the whole region flew with a sad news - in the village of Ust-Kamenka of the Apostolovsky district, on the day of the opening of the pheasant hunt, poachers shot a swan family, who lived on the local pond, for entertainment.
The noble birds were not at all afraid of people - the locals fed them and did not offend them.
When the villagers heard the shots, they ran to the pond, four beautiful swans were already lying dead on the water.
Now the officers of the Apostolov district police department find out who shot the birds listed in the Red Book.
The Russian March is becoming more popular.
On November 4, the Day of National Unity, in Moscow will be held agreed with the city hall "Russian March".
According to a survey of the Levada Center, support for the Russian Marches is growing - already 40% of citizens in varying degrees approve of the idea of holding them.
According to the Levada Center, 40% of citizens to varying degrees approve of the holding of Russian marches: 11% of them are definitely positive and 29% - "rather positive".
The popularity of the idea of "Russian marches" is gradually growing - in 2006, these actions were welcomed by only 14% of Russians, and in December 2010 the holding of such events has already supported twice as many citizens (28%).
"Definitely negative" to "Russian Marches" belong only 7% of Russians, "rather negative" - 19%.
Another 35% could not formulate their attitude to this action.
This year, the Moscow City Hall agreed to hold a Russian March of up to 15,000 people in Lublin, the head of the security department of the capital, Alexey Majorov, said today.
This nationalist campaign has been held every year since 2005 on the Day of National Unity.
When asked by sociologists “Did you hear that on November 4 in Russia “Russian Marches” are held under the slogans of protection of Russian rights in Russia?” three quarters (75%) of citizens answered negatively.
Currently, only one in five Russians knows about this action (20%).
It is noteworthy that in December 2010 almost a third of citizens (31%) heard about the "Russian Marches".
Recall that three years ago, on December 11 in Manezh Square, a spontaneous rally of nationalists took place, which turned into mass riots.
The Levada Center also asked the Russians about what holiday is celebrated on November 4.
In two years, the number of those who know the correct answer (People’s Unity Day) increased from 41% to 49%.
However, only 15% of citizens are going to celebrate this holiday.
About the same (17%) intend to celebrate the Day of the October Revolution on November 7.
The majority of citizens (62%) are not going to celebrate any of these holidays.
How the Moscow City Council agreed on the "Russian March" in Lublin
On October 28, the capital's authorities agreed to hold the "Russian March" on November 4 in Lublin.
This was reported by the leader of the association "Russians", the organizer of the march Dmitry Demushkin.
In addition to the march in Lublin on the Day of National Unity, there will be a rally and rock concert of the band "Kolovrat", also agreed with the authorities.
How was the "Russian March-2012"
On the Day of National Unity in 2012, the nationalists marched from Yakimanskaya promenade to the Central House of the artist, where the rally took place.
The organizers estimated the number of participants in 20 thousand people, the Ministry of Internal Affairs called the number 6 thousand.
Message: Obama's Pre-Election Staff Considered Biden's Exclusion in Favor of Hillary Clinton
According to The New York Times, Obama’s closest advisers were secretly considering replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 electoral roll.
This discovery is the brightest sensation of all the expected book by Mark Halperin and John Hillemann about the 2012 campaign "The stakes have doubled: The game has changed in 2012".
The Times received a copy of the upcoming book and reported on Thursday night that the president's closest aides had conducted "scale focus group research and public opinion polls at the end of 2011" to assess whether Biden's exclusion could help raise staggering hopes for re-election.
According to the political reviewer of The Times Jonathan Martin, the book gives a detailed description of the attempt of high-ranking officials of the pre-election headquarters and the White House, namely the former head of the administration of the White House Bill Daley, to assess the effect of the election of the former president.
The possible replacement was a secret, carefully guarded in the Chicago pre-election headquarters and in the Oval Office.
Only six of the president’s closest advisers — including Daley, former Obama election chief of staff Jim Messin, and former senior White House advisers David Axelrod and David Pluff — knew the replacement was under consideration.
The book "Double the stakes" claims that Daley was the initiator of an attempt to replace Biden, despite their "close personal relationship", but eventually renounced that step when their data showed that adding Clinton to the electoral roll would not "significantly improve the odds."
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration was really considering replacing Biden Clinton.
“I’ve been actively advocating for a lot of things, and it was one of them,” Daley told the paper.
You have to remember that the president was in terrible shape at the time, so we thought, "Oh my God, what are we supposed to do?"
Although Daley described the study as a “necessary check,” Martin told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that the election staff had invested enough in studying whether this move would bring dividends to the vote.
“Pre-election staffs don’t spend that amount of money on polls and focus groups unless they take something seriously,” Martin said in the AK 360 program.
It is unclear, however, whether Obama knew that his team was studying the possibility of a replacement.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his then-boss knew about the possible re-draw.
Although Daley said he didn’t think the president “was aware” of a possible replacement, the former head of the administration admitted that “maybe” Obama knew.
Martin added that “The stakes are doubled” does not give a clear answer to the question of whether the results of the political probe have come to the table of Obama.
Cooper asked Martin if he was serious about Obama not knowing about the possibility of excluding Biden from the electoral roll.
“Perhaps,” Martin said.
Do you want to shine in the darkness of ice cream?
The British entrepreneur created the world’s first dark-light ice cream using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of a marine animal to develop glowing food.
He came up with this idea after reading a scientific article about jellyfish, and convinced scientists in China to chemically recreate the glowing protein.
Ice cream reacts with the tongue of the person who eats it, increasing the pH level of the protein and causing it to glow.
Chris says that as ice cream begins to glow when it responds to the warmth of your mouth, it means that the more you lick, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company Lisny Me, I’m Tasty, says, “It’s an incredible thing, but it’s still in the early stages when it comes to production, so for <0xC2><0xA3>200 you’ll get about 2 grams of substance.”
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at a neutral pH.
Therefore, when your mouth warms up the protein, it will increase the pH level and the ice cream will start to glow.
We’ve been testing it for the last few months, and it seemed like it would be perfect to introduce it to Halloween because it creates such a wonderful glowing effect.
It’s probably the most expensive ice cream I’ve ever made, because jellyfish’s luminescence is four times more expensive than gold.
So each ball costs me about <0xC2><0xA3>140.
But it's quite pleasant to taste.
The experimental company Charlie, based in Bristol, is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef and the taste of primrose gold.
But his next creation must be even more ambitious.
He said, “I really want to develop an invisible ice cream.”
This is by definition impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists
Coach of Avangard Vladimir Chebaturkin, speaking about the preparation of his team for the match of the regular championship of the KHL against "Salavat", noted that Omichi carried out a careful analysis of the defeat from the Magnitogorsk "Metallurg".
The specialist emphasized that "Avant-garde" needs to pay increased attention to the game in defense.
We watched the video of the match against the magnetogory "Metallurg" - according to the official website of "Avangard" the words of Chebaturkin.
- We missed a lot of drives, not a very pleasant moment.
Missed because of their mistakes, because of the failure to perform the game task.
We knew our rivals had performers.
According to statistics, they had five attacks on the go - three wasps hit us.
Very good implementation.
Were these mistakes taken into account in preparing for today’s game?
We and the guys carefully understand each match, talk after the game, prepare for a new opponent.
The main thing is that the installation is carried out.
Everyone saw the first period of the match against Metallurg.
The game was played and the score was 2:0.
Missed the goal "in the locker room" - and in the third period began to make a mistake.
Given how difficult the game was, I didn't see any point in connecting the defenders.
We have to defend the whole team.
Now "Avantgarde" has a long home series, matches go in a day - the team has accumulated fatigue?
All teams are under the same conditions.
The main thing now is to realize your moments and perform the game task.
Hockey is an emotional game, if you do the installation - everything is not so difficult to solve.
Because of the new rules introduced by the Russian customs, for almost a week at the border with Russia, there are hundreds of trucks in line.
Today, Donetsk officials promised to provide drivers with drinking water and install bio-toilets
Hundreds of trucks piled up at border points when entering Russia.
This situation arose due to a change in the rules of customs clearance of goods.
Ukrainian border guards and customs officials confirm: the Russian side is creating the queue, which did not warn about the innovations in advance.
From October 28, the customs authorities of Russia began to apply additional measures to guarantee the delivery of goods, - said the deputy head of the Eastern Customs Vladimir Denisov.
The new model document applies to countries that have acceded to the Convention on International Carriage.
Passpoints work in an enhanced mode.
A FACTOV correspondent visited the border and spoke with truck drivers who were hostages of the situation.
Prices in the roadside shop-café at the checkpoint "Novoazovsk" are increasing every day, as are the queues from the trucks.
The trucks stand in several rows, stretching about two kilometers.
Customs terminal Novoazovsk - Veselo-Voznesenka provides one of the most important transport directions from the south of Ukraine on the international highway.
From here, the goods are sent to the Stavropol region of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia.
On Sunday before midnight still allowed, and after introduced these rules, - complains trucker Alexey Golovanev (pictured), who transits through Russia cargo from Turkey to Kazakhstan and has been staying in his car for almost a week.
Under the new rules, in order to cross the border, I need an additional package of documents and cargo insurance payment.
The amount depends on the cost of the cargo and the distance to which it is carried.
Minimum insurance - 4,5<0xE2><0x88><0x92>5 thousand rubles (about 1100<0xE2><0x88><0x92>1300 hryvnias).
Those who go near (say, to Georgia, Armenia) with a cargo worth up to 50 thousand dollars, pay about 15 thousand rubles (3,800 hryvnias) and pass.
And the rest are stuck - after all, no one has such big money with them!
Imagine, if the driver carries a cargo of only four thousand dollars, but all the way to Moscow, he needs 90 thousand rubles (almost 23 thousand hryvnias) to pay for transit!
The conditions for survival at the border - none - are set by truckers who have settled to eat near their cars.
In cross-border shops and cafes and so is always expensive, but such prices as here, we have not met anywhere!
The sellers were oriented and quickly screwed them: 15 hryvnias worth of baton, seven hryvnias - a cup of coffee, 25 hryvnias - a plate of soup.
And the cafeteria is one.
And there's no toilet.
We sleep in the steppe, we go to the toilet.
Don't wash or shave...
I can not get out of the car for a week, my wife prepared everything for the road.
A week has passed, - comforts another truck driver Viktor Skotarenko.
Is it only going to be a week before my car arrives?
Why do you have one and a half liters of water? - we are interested in the only border store.
There are 11 and 15 hryvnias.
What, a crystal bottle or water infused with silver?
We have a cafe, not a shop.
“Take it while there’s something else,” the saleswoman parrots.
After the situation began to be covered in the media, the plight of Ukrainian drivers was brought to the attention of the authorities of the region.
The leadership of the Amvrosiyevsk and Novoazovsk regional administrations have been instructed to provide drinking water to everyone who stands in line on the Ukrainian-Russian border, said Sergey Dergunov, acting chairman of the Donetsk regional administration.
Ambulance brigades are now on duty at checkpoints.
Biotoilettes will also be installed for the convenience of people.
According to the official, the problem related to the queues will be solved in the coming days.
According to the press service of the Donetsk regional administration, as of October 31, 32 and 68 vehicles were stationed at the international checkpoints of Uspenka and Novoazovsk, respectively.
"FACTS" will monitor the development of the situation.
Vilnius Suspects Moscow in Attempt to Defame Lithuanian President
Russia intends to carry out information provocations against high-ranking Lithuanians and Eastern Partnership countries - a statement to the BNS agency in the Department of State Security of the Republic (DGB).
Information about this is published on the DELFI portal.
According to the report, in particular, Moscow is going to "talk" the President of Lithuania Dalia Gribauskaite and publish falsified documents, allegedly found in the Russian Gosarhiwa, which relate to facts from the biography of the Lithuanian leader.
According to the intelligence service, the preparation of the information attack is carried out by the Department of Public Processes Analysis of the Administration of the President of Russia on Interregional and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries.
The structure is headed by Evgeny Umerenkov, who has visited Lithuania many times and participated in the Congress of the Lithuanian People's Party.
Also a participant in the operation is allegedly an employee of the department V. Smirnov.
According to the intelligence service, Smirnov under cover of scientific work until the end of 2012 regularly came to Lithuania and contacted local politicians, political scientists and representatives of the media.
Now Smirnov is forbidden to enter the territory of the country.
The day before, Lithuanian President Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97> said that she knew about the information attack on her.
In her opinion, the main reason is the successful Lithuanian presidency of the Council of the European Union and the "aspiration of the country to energy independence"
The Lithuanian leader has repeatedly criticized the actions of the Russian authorities.
So she said that the Kremlin treats Lithuania "not sufficiently respectful".
In addition, Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97> accused the head of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin of proposing to Lithuania "only requirements".
In September, Rospotrebnadzor suspended the import of Lithuanian "milk" to Russia.
It was reported that the quality of the products does not comply with sanitary and epidemiological standards.
Then the leader of Lithuania said that if Russia does not lift the ban, the government of the country should prepare an appeal to the WTO.
In the U.S., the school principal shot teenagers.
The director of one of the American secondary schools teenagers literally led to despair.
The man, according to him, was forced to take up arms and start shooting.
The incident occurred in the state of Tennessee.
According to the New York Post, juvenile bullies threw a man’s house with toilet paper.
Because of this, the headmaster of the school opened fire on teenagers, resulting in several injuries to the leg and arm of a 15-year-old boy.
Since the hooligans were not on the property of the director, he was charged with assault under aggravating circumstances.
The man was released from prison on bail of $125,000.
The shooting of civilians in the United States is becoming a horrific pattern.
Literally the day before, the man opened fire in downtown Ridgecrest in the U.S. state of California right on the street.
After that, the criminal took two random passers-by hostage, hid them in the trunk of the car and tried to hide.
Earlier, a shooting was opened at a primary school in Newtown, Connecticut.
Adam's mother worked in school, she was a teacher.
Shooting at American School: 14-Year-Old Girl Wounded
Another shooting incident took place on January 31 at an American school, this time in Annandale, Georgia.
Two people were injured: a 14-year-old student and a teacher.

Halloween of 2013 in numbers.
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, not go to bed until late and arrange a masquerade for our area.
I look more like a squirrel now.
I haven’t had to give out candy in my apartment in the last two years, and I probably won’t be this year.
However, the statistics show that I am a white crow when it comes to Halloween.
According to the National Retail Federation, most Americans — 158 million — will celebrate Halloween this year and will spend a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and jewelry.
The only thing I'm waiting for every Halloween is trends.
The National Retail Federation predicts that costumes will cost $1.2 billion out of the $6.9 billion spent.
This year at the peak of fashion there are sexual inanimate objects.
Women no longer have to be representatives of sexual professions; they can also be sexual food, such as pizza, hamburgers, or carrots.
As for men, I think we’ll see a lot of zombies thanks to Walking Dead, and I’m sure Daft Punk-style astronauts will be on our Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the costumes that are most often searched for are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
There is nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We dressed our dogs last year and, to my surprise, we were not the only ones.
Moreover, according to the National Retail Federation, Americans will spend $330 million on pet costumes this year.
That means a lot of funny dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don’t do anything.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on them this year, according to Nielsen.
That’s about 600 million pounds of Hershey chocolates, lollipops, Milk Duds candy, Twizzlers chewy candy, and Clark Bar bars.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, this is great news for the 41 million candy-demanding children who have prepared to conquer our areas.
What’s more, we’ll buy and — let’s not fool ourselves — eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing we don’t want to eat is candy in the form of corn grains; and yet, according to the National Association of Confectioners, almost <0xC2><0xA3>35 million of it is sold under Halloween.
That's about 9 billion individual corn kernels.
This is a mystery I still have to solve.
Nothing expresses the essence of Halloween so much as a house with ghosts.
They have amazing titles, such as “Horror Behind the Walls” (which, by the way, is in a real prison), “Wow and Scream” and “House of Shock”.
Moreover, according to the society of America Haunts, in America there are 1,200 officially recognized houses with ghosts, generating about $500 million in revenue, as well as those amazing photos where you almost described the face, which your friend posted the face, and you can not remove the face, and then the face, and the face, and then the face, and the face, and the face, and the face, and the face.
Finally, let’s talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Big Pumpkin when we were kids, and cutting out Jack’s lamp is like decorating a Christmas tree, something we’ve been doing since childhood.
Fortunately for us, the baby pumpkin fashion started only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up cutting out these pumpkins instead of sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, this year Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins.
Jack’s lamp, slowly drying out on your porch, likely came from Illinois, which grew 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.
If you want more complicated tasks, visit Tim and Susan Mathisdon in the city of Napa, California, and try to cut some of their pumpkin weighing in at <0xC2><0xA3>2032.
The website of the Ministry of Defense of Estonia was restored after the attack of Ukrainian hackers
The work of the website of the Ministry of Defense of Estonia has been restored after the morning cyberattack, the press service of the ministry said.
According to the Deputy Chancellor of the Ministry of Defense on information and administrative issues of Timar Peterkop, it was a primitive attack, the site was simply overloaded with a large number of requests.
Our specialists quickly set everything up, so far the work of the site has been restored.
"The damage done to the ministry is minimal," Peterkop told Postimees.
According to Peterkop, it is too early to talk about who organized the attacks.
"We will certainly analyze the causes of the incident and draw our own conclusions from it, but it is completely impossible to prevent such incidents," he said.
On November 1, the group Anonymous Ukraine posted on the network an appeal in which it confirmed the hacking attack on the website of the Ministry of Defense of Estonia and opposed the partnership of Ukraine and NATO.
We want NATO leadership to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We should not be servants of NATO.
Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of NATO member states.
Ukraine does not need a NATO bloc.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Ukraine doesn’t need Russia either.
Ukraine should not be anyone’s slave.
We are in favour of an independent Ukraine.
“Hands away from Ukraine,” Anonymous said in a statement.
Earlier, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported that the company of the Marines of the Feodosia separate battalion of the Ukrainian Marines will take part in the command and staff exercises of the NATO Steadfast Jazz-2013 reaction forces.
Due to the violence, several schools and hospitals had to be closed.
Four schools in Zimbabwe’s southern Matabeleland province had to close due to students being attacked... by goblins.
As the local elder said, the children panicked, and it was impossible to continue the classes.
The story of the goblin may sound like a child’s invention to a European, but in Africa it is quite a serious argument to close the school.
Adults are also afraid of impurity.
In the summer, for example, a hospital in Zimbabwe was closed due to the fact that the medical personnel were also attacked by goblins.
Announced the release of the Land Rover racing series

In addition, you can get upgraded brakes, a service package that provides access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and car storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “Rally participants addressing Bowler have changed.”
Some of them are not experienced racers, but people looking for excitement, adventure and access to world-class events.
We are pleased to offer such a path in partnership with Land Rover and MSA and believe that this format offers a new way to try different rally disciplines in the UK and abroad, as well as to prepare participants for the difficult conditions and realities of the rally.
“We were very excited to develop the Defender Challenge – it’s going to be a really exciting championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge provides one day in February for training and testing, as well as the opportunity to take part in desert events in North Africa and the Middle East.
Russian security forces do not know anything about the group "Brother's Circle" - New Izvestia
This is written by INTERFAX.RU with reference to an informed source in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation.
“After media reports surfaced that the U.S. Treasury Department had put Leps on checklists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate ‘Brother’s Circle’, we searched all the databases, but such groups were not found,” the agency’s interlocutor said.
In his opinion, the dissemination of this information contributes to maintaining the myth of the so-called Russian mafia, which allegedly operates abroad.
As we wrote earlier, yesterday the U.S. Treasury Department published on its website a list of alleged members of the criminal group "Brother Circle".
Among them was named the Russian singer Grigory Leps.
It appears on the list as "Greece", posted the day before.
With the data of the popular Russian performer, they coincide.
The exact name - Grigory Lepsevridze, creative alias, place and date of birth.
In addition to Leps, there are five other people mentioned.
Two Russians, a citizen of Israel, a citizen of Uzbekistan and another from the former USSR, whose citizenship is not indicated.
In the United States, Gregory Leps, who lives on the island of Phuket, transported money to the bandits on their order.
This message is accompanied by a photo of the singer and all his data that corresponds to reality.
Moreover, Leps really recently bought a house in Phuket.
The ministry noted that they intend to impose sanctions against Leps.
The blacklisting of a person by the U.S. Treasury involves blocking his assets in the U.S. and banning business contacts with people living in the United States.
Leps' assistant Maya Serikova said that no notifications to the singer had been received: "It is difficult to answer the question whether this is Gregory, about which everyone is now talking about in connection with the scandal in the United States."
All Leps knows is the media.
Officially, there were no notifications to him personally, although I do not know if they are in such cases.
“And, of course, it’s all funny on the one hand, and surprisingly and unexpectedly on the other,” she told RIA Novosti.
According to her, in Phuket Gregory Leps does not live, but, according to the U.S. Treasury Department, he really has a house on the Thai island.
She said that now Leps is on a long tour of the Far East and Siberia, and that the news caught him during the flight to the city of Blagoveshchensk.
Runner on the field in the match "Shinnik"
Some details about the personality of the fan who ran on the field during the match of the 1/16 final of the Cup of Russia between Yaroslavl "Shinnik" and Moscow "Spartak" became known.
According to the head of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation Artur Grigoryants, citing the data of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, this fan is a Muscovite.
He is currently under arrest.
In addition, Grigoryants talked about how the fan managed to break through on the field: "It turned out that this, let's call him a spectator, went to an ambulance accompanied by two spectators, citing problems with the heart.
He went to an ambulance, the ambulance confirmed to us.
And then he pushed away the two companions and ran to the field.
He fled from the corner of the Eastern and Southern Tribune to the corner of the Eastern and Northern Tribune.
He ran all over the field.
Stewards are responsible for this.
Before the entry into force of the sport law, this is the area of action of the stewards - the police can not interfere in what is on the field.
He ran to the stand, passed through the East Stand.
And at this time, riots began on the Eastern Tribune and on the runways," the head of the KDC said.
Recall that the decision of the KDC Moscow "Spartak" will hold without spectators the upcoming matches of the 15th round of the championship of Russia against "Lokomotiv" and "Zenit", and will pay a fine in the amount of 600,000 rubles.
Firefighters were summoned to rescue a lost puppy who was stuck at a height of 50 feet above the ground in a dangerous career downturn.
Cocker Spaniel Ruby ran away after getting into a small accident
Three days later, her, stuck in a quarry, noticed a man walking a dog
Firefighters descended on a rope on a steep slope to save the dog from imminent death
The puppy was lucky to be rescued after being summoned by firefighters to pick him up and take him to a safe place after he was somehow stuck at a height of 50 feet on a dangerous slope.
Nine-month-old Cocker Spaniel Ruby ran away after getting into a car accident on Sunday afternoon, and spent three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Her hosts, 25-year-old Scott Alderson and his 20-year-old friend Becky Hall, were at the Flappit quarry in the town of Denholm in West Yorkshire to reunite with Ruby, and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They were feverishly searching for their missing dog and posting addresses on social media sites after she ran into a career after a small accident.
At about 14:15 on Wednesday, a star dog walker spotted Ruby, stuck at a height of 50 feet in a career downhill.
A technical rescue team from the Cléchhiton fire station rushed to the scene, descended down the ropes to rescue Ruby, and used the carry-on to lift her up the slope.
Rescue officer Andy Clayton said: “She was in a dangerous position.”
It was right in the middle of a sloping slope — 50 feet to the top and to the ground.
She didn't move her muscle during the rescue, she was completely frozen.
But now she's fine.
Then she ate cookies.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog was spotted is unbelievable.
Rescue officer Peter Lau said: “Ruby is very lucky to have been rescued.”
There was a chance that she might have suffered a very serious injury or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for examination, and it was found that everything was fine with her, except exhaustion and dehydration.
Mrs. Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “Watching salvation was scary.”
I couldn't believe she was even there.
It was great when she was in our hands again.
The veterinarian said that if she became obese and lost consciousness, she would probably fall.
The firefighters were great.
It was very brave, what they did.
We are so grateful and each of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr. Alderson of the City of Kitley added, “We were afraid it might fall, but it stayed there.”
The firefighters were amazing.
I just can't believe she was there.
Mick Jagger Says He Didn't Play With Katy Perry When She Was 18
During an interview on the Australian radio show this week, the pop star stated that she was a backing vocalist for Jagger's 2004 song Old Habits Die Hard.
Perry said she was having dinner with a veteran rocker, and noted, “He played with me when I was 18.”
She added: “It’s been a very long time, and he was very kind.”
In a statement on Thursday, a spokesman for the 70-year-old Jagger said he "categorically denies that he ever hit Katy Perry."
The representative added: “Maybe she confuses him with someone else.”
Perry was among the performers who appeared as guests on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album Prism debuted at number one this week.
George Kerevan: the gap with Europe gives the Scots a choice
Another day, another scarecrow about independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland will have to join the pan-European free movement zone as a condition of EU membership.
There is a series of stories about passport control in Berwick and the border with barbed wire along the Adrianov shaft.
True, the Strathclyde newspaper pointed to the possible economic benefits of more free movement across the rest of Europe, although — predictably — this did not appear in the headlines.
No one has also pointed out that EU member states spend a lot of time turning their formal rules around as they see fit.
Since Scotland is now not part of the Schengen area, continuing non-compliance would be a cheap concession for Brussels in exchange for what it really wanted from the Scots.
So this is not a worthy story.
And so old that it turned into a fossil: for the first time I heard a duck say that “independence means passport control” at least 40 years ago.
And yet there is an interesting moment, lost in the retelling of an ancient fairy tale.
Why should an independent Scotland obey Europe’s orders?
Why change the yoke of London to the yoke of Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real European news: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stalled.
With the Euro crisis, the project “Europe” is officially dead.
Throughout the European Union, parties opposed to the EU or for the abolition of the euro as a single currency are gaining momentum.
Even in Germany, the “Alternative for Germany” Eurosceptic party – founded only this year – emerged out of nowhere and won nearly five million votes in the September federal election, effectively ejecting the “Free Democrats” (an analogue of our “Liberal Democrats”) from the Bundestag.
There has always been an internal opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has become a turning point.
The austerity measures put in place by Berlin and the European Central Bank, and the shackles imposed on national economies through the preservation of a single currency, have led many people to think that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments are working with excessive budget deficits – this was only true for Greece.
In fact, the euro system has blocked its members at exchange rates that benefit German exporters, which German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, southern Europe is in a pre-disadvantaged position in terms of production capacity compared to Germany.
The only way out is to cut wages and government spending, which is actively supported by Berlin.
Behind the current problems of budget and currency lies a deeper problem of Europe’s productive capacity.
As a result of the set of measures on “green” energy implemented by Brussels, a code that means subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer, European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as in the US.
This is paralyzingly unfavorable price conditions, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
No freezing of wages in the world will stop the crushing victory of cheap US shale gas over the European petrochemical industry.
As a result, the rebellion, especially in France, once the EU’s most fervent supporter, is ripe.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on a par with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of gaining political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving France’s devastated economy in a dire situation.
The result is the right-wing anti-EU party Marine Le Pen’s “National Front” has just won crucial by-elections, putting the ruling Socialist Party in third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote — a timely warning to British Labour that it cannot be assumed that a split between the right and the left will automatically affect the left.
What does Le Pen do with his newfound popularity among the French white working class?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to create a bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and against the single currency.
If – and this is very likely – anti-EU parties get support in these elections, such a bloc will be able to take a dominant position in the European Parliament for the first time.
Here is my opinion: the soon-to-be-growing sentiments against the EU and against the single currency in Europe are coming together to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will again become something of a vague “Europe of (sovereign) nations” that General de Gaulle liked.
Germany and several dependent economies can keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will recover their own currencies.
I assume that the UK is distancing itself from this project in the hope of getting closer to the US.
However, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific indicates the likelihood that Britain will be left unattended in the cold Atlantic.
What is the situation with Scotland?
We can choose to become a region (in essence) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which means, among other things, sending Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect that Scotland will be able to succeed under a more free European arrangement, provided that we keep our currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider repeating Norway's experience and maintaining our economic independence.
The Government of the Scottish National Party in Scotland is, oddly enough, the most successful political movement in Europe against austerity measures, which received an impressive majority of votes in 2011 thanks to objections against the cost reductions proposed (and implemented) by the Labour Chancellor of the Treasury.
It would be absurd for Scotland to vote for independence only to take the austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Aging earlier
African-American and Latin American girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts, research shows.
Physical changes do not mean that sexual maturation is close
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are to blame.
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic may be one of the triggers of early puberty
The tendency to early sexual maturity is not so pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children’s health and family issues.
Should a mother be afraid if her daughter begins to form breasts and grow pubic hair at 7 or 8 years?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplovitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time reassuring parents — usually it doesn’t mean a quick onset of full sexual maturity,” Kaplovitz said.
Obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and axillary hair and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
But there has been only a slight shift in the age of menarche (the first menstruation) over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, down from 12.75 in 1970.
“After the breast begins to develop, it takes at least two to three years before the menarche,” said Kaplovitz, who is also the author of the book “Early puberty in girls: how to cope with this common problem.”
Time is the most accurate test of how sexual maturation will progress.
There is a discussion about what constitutes the actual onset of sexual maturity, but is considered “premature” when breast augmentation is accompanied by a sharp increase in growth up to 8 years.
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop - this is something that the pediatrician can monitor closely.
A faster progression may serve as the basis for tests by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to slower growth and low growth in adulthood.
Recommendations for drug or hormone therapy are based on the child's age, level of development, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplovitz is wary of medications, but admits that “suppression of puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and the feeling of girls that they are different from their peers.”
Another big problem is clear: parents just don’t want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
“They worry about the risk of pregnancy or even how they handle hygiene issues,” Kaplovitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls one woman whose daughter began menstruation at the age of 10.
Although there were signs and we were talking about menstruation, she was not emotionally ready.
She came home from school scared and upset that she was the first of her friends.
There are many theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent evidence that hormones are to blame in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media.
In boys, as in girls, sexual maturation occurs earlier.
Kaplovitz argues that the prerequisite that has the greatest weight is an obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped carry out a study of girls between the ages of 6 and 9, which links the amount of fat in the body with the timing of puberty.
Other data support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African American and Latin American girls tend to reach sexual maturity earlier than their white counterparts.
There are different explanations.
Around the world, early sexual maturation appears to be affected by everything from economic conditions and climate to genes.
Another mystery: although the hair on the face and on the shank of boys appears at a younger age, the tendency to complete early sexual maturation is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors participating in the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of this topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair occurs even in infants and children of infancy.
“We need to be careful about how we determine the true onset of sexual maturity,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Gorieb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not be ashamed to receive instructions from the pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
“This could mean earlier than expected conversation,” Kaplovitz explained.
If you remain calm, your child will usually respond well.
Girls who bloom early need confirmation that even when it happens earlier than usual, this process is a normal part of life.
U.S. Boeing stuck in Chita prepares for flight
The U.S. aircraft that carried out observation flights over Russian territory under the Open Skies Treaty and made an unplanned landing in Chita on Wednesday, November 1, at 8:30 a.m. Moscow time, will leave the city’s air port.
The management of the airport allowed the flight on board, having received money for fuel.
As reported at the airport, the plane will fly to Ulan-Ude.
According to other data, he will go to the United States.
As reported, the plane flying to Ulan-Ude landed in the Trans-Baikal region due to fog.
Due to unpaid bills, he was not released from Chita airport.
On board the plane are 30 people, including the crew, two nights they spent at the airport, reports ITAR-TASS.
According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, according to the terms of the Open Skies Treaty, people on board the aircraft do not have the right to go outside the Chita airport, they can pass border control only at two Russian airports - in Kubinka and in Ulan-Ude.
The Open Skies Treaty was signed in 1992, involving 34 States.
Observation flights are carried out over the territories of Russia, the United States, Canada, and European countries.
The main objectives of the Treaty are the development of transparency, the promotion of the monitoring of the implementation of agreements in the field of arms control, the expansion of the possibilities for crisis prevention and resolution of crisis situations within the framework of the OSCE and other international organizations.
How Much Do Dead Celebrities Earn - MK in USA MK
The ranking of the highest-income living celebrities in 2013 was headed by Madonna, who earned $125 million.
But it was spewed by the late Michael Jackson, whose posthumous income from October 2012 to October 2013 amounted to 160 million.
Significantly behind him are other deceased celebrities, who last year "earned" several times less.
Elvis Presley was second in the list of the most "sustainable" departed celebrities compiled by Forbes magazine at the end of the year - 55 million for the year, and the line below the author of the comics Peanuts Charles Schulz with 37 million.
In addition, the top five included Elizabeth Taylor, who was the leader last year (25 million), and musician Bob Marley (18 million).
The list also included Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon and Albert Einstein.

Manufacturers of jet aircraft are annoyed about the width of the seat, when large orders are at stake
Leading aircraft manufacturers have sparked a fierce dispute over the width of tourist-class seats on long-haul flights, setting the tone for a fierce confrontation at this month’s Dubai Aviation Exhibition.
The dispute revolves around the width of seats provided on long-haul flights to economy-class passengers, whose interests are not always in the center of attention of airlines, while the volume of space allocated to them plays a key role in the claims about the effectiveness of the latest AiringAS aircraft.
Airbus this week called for the introduction of an industry standard that would provide for a seat width of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in economy-class cabins, but its main American competitor Boeing says this should be decided by airlines.
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing in sales of increasingly larger versions of their two-engine long-haul aircraft, and potentially record orders are expected at the event on November 17-21.
The layout of the rear of the aircraft – especially whether there are 9 or 10 people in a row – occupies a central place in the statements about the economic efficiency of new projects “mini-aerobuses”.
Boeing claims that its updated 777X will accommodate 406 people, based on seats in the economy class more than 17 inches wide, placed 10 in each row.
Airbus says the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economy-class seats 18 inches wide, 9 in a row.
Aircraft giants often exchange blows on technical issues with the help of advertising in the professional press.
And now Airbus is addressing the public directly in front of the airshow in Dubai, where the 777X is expected to become the leader with more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated what could be the beginning of a new advertising war by showing financiers a slide depicting three people in a restaurant pinched to each other, titled “Would you agree to this?”
“Boeing offers long-haul flights on narrower seats than regional turboprop aircraft,” said Airbus Chief Sales Officer John Lihi.
With a change in diet, people gain weight, but the airplane seats have not changed dramatically.
Between the early 1970s, when the wide-body Boeing 747 set the standards for modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the weight of an average American man aged 40 to 49 increased by 10 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Health.
The waist circumference of an average 21st century American man is 39.7 inches, according to statistics from the U.S. Health Service.
Airbus claims that its competitor adheres to the 1950s seating concept, when the average waist circumference of those recently called the “reactive audience” was already.
Airbus says it has ordered a study showing that an extra inch of seat width improves sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing is challenging Airbus' seat size figures and says manufacturers shouldn't interfere with decisions about how airlines find a balance between fares and convenience.
According to her, studies show that the comfort of the cabin depends not only on the width of the seat.
“It’s really all about giving airlines the choice and the opportunity to do what they think they need to do to be successful,” said Kent Craver, Boeing’s cabin specialist.
They do not want us to decide for them what will bring them profit.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, the issue is to increase the space on the sides, but for suppliers, this is increasingly becoming a factor that can affect profits.
Behind this dispute is the race for aircraft orders, estimated at least $700 billion in catalog prices in the coming decades — enough to change the ratio of American and European exports.
As Reuters reported for the first time in July, the location of the seats is exactly what fuels the rivalry in the battle between the newest jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing are claiming a 20 percent increase in profitability by one place in their latest two-engine long-haul models compared to the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
Boeing's stated specifications are partly based on a comparison of the 777X 10-seat rows with the original 9-seat row layout of the 777 design solution.
The gain in the individual cost is reduced when compared to the 10-seat layout currently used.
“The reason Boeing is doing this is to squeeze more space and make its aircraft more competitive compared to our developments,” said Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at Airbus in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins with full 10-seat rows for the existing 777s indicate that many passengers prefer a dense landing that can go hand-in-hand with lower fares.
“Eighteen-inch seats would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view, the Airbus offer is a threat from the 777 model,” said interior designer Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats, but offer a catalog of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
Traveling around the world, jet aircraft sellers even take roulette with them to check out competing schedules.
Praising comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a very dense cabin layout for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers the A350 with 10-seat rows, but says it hasn’t sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus has emphasized the need for additional cabin modifications, offering wider passageways on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, experts say, its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to "fly up", but can distract from the sales wave of the 777X.
New Anti-Nicotine Vaccine May Deprive the Smoking Process of Pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could deprive the process of smoking cigarettes of pleasure.
One dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine addiction for life.
Further tests are needed before human trials begin, which will take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Wells Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results are encouraging.
“We very much hope that such a strategy of using the vaccine can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to quit by trying out all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their nicotine addiction is strong enough to overcome it with these modern means,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that was designed to carry genetic information to produce anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begin to produce a stable flow of antibodies.
Antibodies track down any nicotine molecules in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting a nicotine shot.
In the tests, the vaccinated mice, who were subsequently given nicotine, continued their normal activity.
And the mice that were not given the vaccine “relaxed,” and this is a sign that nicotine reached their brains, the researchers say.
These experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
The previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies to the virus.
To maintain high levels of antibodies, the injections had to be done so often that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of a new vaccine is likely to be much lower because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine were completely safe, it could be given to children before they have a desire to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely that it will be used by smokers to quit smoking.
“They’ll know that if they start smoking again, they won’t get pleasure from this because of the nicotine vaccine, and it can help them get rid of this habit,” he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but warned that more research was needed.
Oleynikov: a third of rural settlements of the Moscow suburbs are fully subsidized
Deputy Governor of the Moscow Region Yuri Oleinikov said that almost a third of the rural settlements of the Moscow region are fully subsidized
A total of 187 out of 288 settlements receive subsidies from the region’s budget.
In 2013, 187 out of 288 settlements received subsidies from the regional budget.
The share of subsidies in the revenues of the budget of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50%, and 83 - 100%.
Within the framework of budget security, about 25 billion rubles are sent from the regional budget," Oleinikov said.
Also, the Deputy Governor noted that only three urban settlements - Mytisht, Odintsovo and Pushkino - the volume of revenues of the budget is more than 1 billion rubles for 2013.
The income of rural settlements in many areas is less than 3 million rubles, "this is not enough".
The costs for the maintenance of the local administrative apparatus in 88 settlements of the Moscow region is more than 70%, "while there is a decrease in the quality of services," Oleynikov noted.
Earlier, he instructed the heads of municipal entities of the Moscow region to think before the end of November about which settlements need to be enlarged, merged into urban districts or changed the administrative management system.
These proposals will be worked out by the end of January.
Previously, the governor of the Moscow region said that as part of the administrative reform in the Moscow region, it is planned to reduce the number of subsidized rural settlements.
Also in Mozhaisky, Kashirsky, Solnechnogorsky, Kolomensky districts, Luberts and Kotelniks there is a request for the enlargement of municipalities.
The discussion of this issue in cities and regions of the region will begin in November.
The Chairman of the Moscow Duma, Igor Brynzalov, also said that about 30 rural settlements in 12 districts of Moscow are planned to be united in the framework of the upcoming admreform.
This is due to the fact that of the 178 rural settlements in the Moscow region, less than a third have an "acceptable" financial base, and 100 have a subsidy base.
Diana Arbenina Celebrates Halloween With Her Kids
Diana Arbenina does not hide how much pleasure she receives from raising her children.
Despite the fact that right now Arbenina spends a lot of time on creativity and social activity, she still finds the opportunity to play with Martha and Artem, and not only spends time studying them, but also entertains as much as she can.
Over the past week, Diana has twice reported to her fans about her pedagogical talents.
First, she posted a photo on Facebook that shows how she teaches children to read.
And yesterday, she cheered the fans, showing how she dressed Artem and Martha for Halloween.
To the broom races ready! our first halloween" - so called Diana photo of her children dressed in festive costumes.
Which is unwise, because they, like no other Russian boys and girls, are related to this holiday, since they were born in America.
Germany is the first in Europe to introduce "undefined sex" when registering children
Germany will be the first country in Europe where it will be allowed to indicate "unspecified" instead of male or female when registering children born to hermaphrodites.
The parents of the child will have the right to leave the "sex" in the birth certificate incomplete for a while.
Instead of "F" (female gender) or "M" (male gender), parents can write "X" (unspecified) for a time.
This decision is aimed at not pushing parents to rush with the operation to "specify" the sex.
According to statistics, one in 2,000 newborns in the world is born with hermaphroditis.
Tripodi denies being subject to Obeid's influence
Former New South Wales Labour Minister Joe Tripodi will be the lead investigator of the state’s anti-corruption watchdog.
Former New South Wales Minister Joe Tripodi denies any changes to the order of the lease of seaside facilities at the request of his political adviser, Eddie Obaid, who secretly owned shares in three properties on state land.
The Independent Anti-Corruption Commission (ICAC) on Friday expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obeid had lobbied several ministers of state to extend leases to Serkular Ki, where the Obeid family own two restaurants and cafes, without passing a tender after their expiry in August 2005.
It is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obaid's secret involvement in real estate following testimony given by Mr. Tripodi's former deputy head of administration Lynn Eshpool on Thursday.
During several years of discussions, which began in 2005, the Government insisted that the lease be submitted to an open competition.
The tenants were against this and also wanted longer lease terms.
In 2009, the lease agreements on Serkular Ki, which brought the Obaidov family about $2.5 million a year, were extended without being submitted to an open competition.
Mr. Tripodi, who was Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 to November 2009, initially advocated open competitions.
But he denied that the changes had been made at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, as Mr. Tripodi acknowledged, had strongly advised to make changes to the Government's rental policy.
The ICAC decryption of the telephone conversations presented was conducted in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obaid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dann, a senior official who came to the port ministry after working under Mr. Obaid in the Department of Fisheries.
“Was the issue discussed during these telephone conversations an issue of commercial lease policy development?” asked Commissioner Anthony Willy’s assistant, Mr. Tripodi.
"No," replied Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it was definitely wrong.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obid.
According to a high-ranking official, Israeli military aircraft attack targets inside Syria
A senior administration official in an interview with Fox News confirmed that Israeli military aircraft had struck a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday evening.
The official did not specify what the purpose was, but said at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel carried out airstrikes on cargoes with missiles inside Syria.
Foreign workers on subclass 457 visas can be tested for “authenticity”
The “authenticity” test for foreign workers on class 457 visas is under consideration by the government as it envisages an expansion of repressive measures.
This test, if accepted, will be applied to the criteria aimed at preventing the use of Class 457 visas to fill unskilled positions or as a loophole for moving family and friends to Australia.
The paper, submitted by the government for discussion, was published today, while former Labour MP Maxine McKee criticized the government’s rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia’s neighbors.
“Ugly statements like ‘foreigners are at the end of the line’ and ‘work for Australians first’ represent a very unpleasant reversal of the times when trade unions were demanding a protected labour market,” she told the Australia-India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that it was white labor that needed to be protected — and if some in the region saw the echoes of this historical artifact, I wouldn’t be surprised.
The document presented for discussion outlines 12 measures that were previously considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he meets with officials about human smuggling, has already made five of the recommended changes, and the rest are under consideration.
If the criteria for “authenticity” are accepted, the applicant for a visa may be examined to determine whether the application is genuine in a situation where the applicant is a relative or close acquaintance of the owner or a person relevant to the financing of the enterprise.
Businesses may also be required to report on the number of visa holders in subclass 457, as businesses that intended to sponsor a small number of employees were then recruited by hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker has reportedly died of a heart attack after arriving on Christmas Island this week by boat with refugees.
The man's nine-year-old son, who was sadly killed, accompanied him on his way to Australia, and since his father's death on Wednesday, he has been supported by a cousin who was also aboard the ship.
Australian authorities rushed the man to a hospital on Christmas Island, where he died.
A friend of Semen Varlamova said that the hockey player suffers from alcoholism
A friend of the hockey player Semen Varlamov Yevgeny Vavrinyuk said that he suffers from alcoholism, reports the Russian News Service.
“He has no idea how to stop drinking,” the woman said.
Recall that Vavrinyuk sued for beating the goalkeeper of the Russian national team Semen Varlamov, who is also a member of the club "Colorado".
According to her, the hockey player pulled her by the hair, and also beat - after the attack, her hands, chest, stomach and neck were damaged.
Varlamov himself came with guilt to the Denver police and confessed to the beating, describing in detail what happened.
He was arrested, but later released on bail for $5,000.
The court did not restrict the athlete in movements around the country, but prohibited him from approaching Vavrinyuk.
He is also facing up to six years in prison for domestic violence.
The UK government has announced a study aimed at increasing the economic impact for Scotland from the HS2 railway project.
Project HS2 envisages the opening of high-speed communication with Scotland and the North of England, with the start of the First Stage in 2026
The Minister of Transport, Baroness Kramer, noted that the project “will unite the UK”.
Scotland’s transport minister, Keith Brown, said he was “excited” about the prospect of working with the UK government on a plan.
The first stage will be the construction of a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When Stage Two is completed, the lines will be laid in Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and northern England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The UK government, which is negotiating with Transport Scotland, has instructed HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements in rail throughput and reduced travel times for Northern England and Scotland.
This should include the ability to cross the road from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal at HS2 is to create a truly national network that will make Britain and its cities closer to each other.”
We are developing HS2 because the benefits it will bring are huge.
Without it, we will face a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it’s also about connecting cities to each other; across the UK, 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will get the best communication thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael added: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael “unambiguously” to support Scotland’s inclusion in the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: “The high-speed railway has every chance of bringing huge economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds the economic weight of Scotland to the general argument for the high-speed railway across the UK.”
We are therefore pleased to work in partnership with the UK Government to consider options for building a high-speed railway in Scotland, creating benefits for all and continuing the Glasgow-Edinburgh railway line that the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the results of the study with the British ministers next year and taking a joint decision on the next steps.
Is Tory the New Hope of Nuclear Energy?
Governments around the world continue to think about how to meet energy needs.
The burning of hydrocarbons (where they exist) has a negative impact on the climate.
Renewable energy requires a large amount of space to generate.
Atomic energy costs no more than that, but leaves behind a lot of expensive waste in recycling.
Recently, scientists have paid attention to thorium - another radioactive element of the Mendeleev system.
It is found all over the world, and, according to experts, its splitting does not leave any waste that needs to be stored for centuries.
Rules for the use of electronic devices on aircraft in Australia will remain in force for the time being
Passengers of Australian airlines will need to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, despite measures in the US to mitigate the rules concerning these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has allowed U.S. carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during take-off and landing, provided they remain in “flight mode.”
Passengers can already do this during the main part of the flight, but many are irritated that they do not have access to their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are considering this decision, which required US airlines to spend a huge amount of work to meet the new requirements, but have indicated that they do not plan to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Office also noted that it is considering the statement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in the critical phases of flight are still in place in Australia.
“The Civil Aviation Safety Administration currently has no specific rules governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft,” it said.
This issue is governed by rules that require air carriers to ensure safety at all times, and passengers to comply with safety rules, which are communicated to them by crew members.
Virgin, which has already discussed with the Civil Aviation Safety Board the expansion of its on-board entertainment system with Wi-Fi, was not opposed to the changes, but said it would follow the regulator’s instructions.
“We would welcome the Civil Aviation Safety Board’s consideration of allowing the use of electronic devices because we really think it will improve the quality of customer service now that it (the onboard wireless entertainment system) is on our planes,” the spokesman said.
Qantas has said it will abide by the rules in force at the moment.
“Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we do not plan to change it in the near future,” she said.
The FAU regulation applies to U.S. airlines.
However, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will certainly carefully study the FAU’s decision and the reasons behind it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the ruling will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to prove that their aircraft is resistant to radio waves from mobile devices, as well as review manuals, training materials, rules for carrying hand luggage and instructions for passengers.
“Once the airline checks and confirms the interference resistance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-books and smartphones, at any height,” the FAU said.
In rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their devices during landing.
In addition, according to the group’s recommendation, heavier devices should be located under the seats or in the upper luggage compartments during take-off and landing.
The head of Dagestan heard in the anthem of Kubani notes of extremism
The football match between "Anji" and "Kuban" ended in a political clash between the authorities of the Krasnodar region and Dagestan after fans burned the Dagestan flag, and the anthem of Kubani sounded differently.
The head of Dagestan Ramazan Abdulatipov on Thursday invited Republican parliamentarians to go to court, because the anthem of the Krasnodar region allegedly calls for inter-ethnic diversity, in particular, calls for a war with the "basurmans".
Take the anthem of the Krasnodar region, it was in our time in 1995 that this anthem was approved.
It's a shame, and nobody's doing it.
"Remembering you here, as a mother of the native, the enemy, the Basurmanin, we are going to a mortal battle" - for which such words are recorded in the hymn, to poison some believers on other believers, - expressed solidarity with the Abdulatipov the Speaker of the Parliament Hizri Shihsaidov.
Putin achieves impunity for his friend Assad
And now, news from across the ocean, namely from Syria, where, as we learned today, Israel struck Russian-made missiles, which reportedly were intended for Hezbollah.
Today, Syria has fulfilled an important condition - to destroy its chemical weapons production by November 1.
This was done within the framework of an agreement reached through Russian mediation that allowed the United States not to carry out a military operation to which it was close this summer.
More details about the weapons and what all this means for the Syrian president will be told by our chief international correspondent Richard Engel.
Washington said the Assad regime would be punished for this.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, were killed in August by poison gas.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of American bombings, but in the form of a deal that Assad's friend Vladimir Putin made.
Syria will give up its chemical weapons by the middle of next year.
Today is an important milestone.
A group of international experts said that Syria had dismantled the declared chemical weapons factories.
A more long-term and difficult task is the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and their components.
As we understand it is about a thousand tons.
Earlier, Washington said the days of Assad were numbered.
I think Assad should go.
The question is not whether it will happen, but when it will happen.
He's no longer legit and has to leave.
Assad remains.
And he feels even more confident.
His troops still use artillery, rockets and napalm.
His opponents are divided and poorly armed.
His people are forced to leave their homes, many are starving.
Some have to feed on leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar al-Assad escaped punishment for mass murder.
The agreement on chemical weapons is called the success of diplomacy, inspectors were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself made the impression of a person ready to cooperate.
Today in Washington, the U.S. ambassador to Syria had to answer difficult questions.
When a child dies of starvation, it is unlikely that his mother will find it easier that he was not killed by chemical weapons.
Assad is still there.
It changes weapons to power.
The President of the Russian Federation created a separate Ministry of Construction and Housing
Russian President Vladimir Putin created a new ministry that oversees construction and residential housing and proposed to head it to the former governor of the Ivanovo region, Mikhail Menu, in the process of a personal meeting.
The President met with Mikhail Meneh at the residence in Novo-Ogarevo, and Meneh did not refuse to head the new office.
The press secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov explained that all functions related to construction and housing are transferred to the new ministry from the Minregion.
Mikhail Men - son of the famous Orthodox priest proto-priest Alexander Menya, graduated from the Moscow Institute of Petrochemicals named after Gubkin.
Since 1995 began his political career - he was elected to the Moscow Regional Duma from the Sergei-Posad district, was a deputy of the State Duma, first Deputy Prime Minister of the Government of the Moscow Region, Deputy Prime Minister of the Government of Moscow.
From 2005 to October 16, 2013, Mikhail Men was the governor of Ivanovo region.
The pawnshop owners in Singapore are doing well, while the middle class is experiencing difficulties
In a pawnshop in Singapore’s Bendemir shopping mall, Janani Amirthalinga puts on a gold bracelet, ring and earrings to pay for her daughter’s schooling.
“My husband and I just bought a house, so all my money is invested there,” says Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although she earns S$3,000 ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, the family’s monthly income is not enough, she says.
Indeed, demand in various parts of Southeast Asia — where household debt is growing — is such that ValueMax, where it conducts its transaction, this week became the third pawnbroker listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
A jewellery loan is not just a quick way to get money (S$1,300 in Mrs. Amirthaling’s case), but almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In Singapore, pawnbrokers typically charge an effective annual interest rate of 17% — just above the 15.4% offered by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping mall.
However, pawnshops have the advantage that they do not require credit checks or proof of salary and can issue loans faster than banks.
That’s why millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops as families feel pressured by rising cost of living and the rapid growth of household debt and consumer debt.
After five years of sustained growth following the global financial crisis and cheap loans fuelled by free monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnshops to offset a decline in income savings as their growth slows.
This week, Standard & Poor's, a rating agency, indicated an increase in family credit leverage, largely due to rising mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia led the list with 80% of GDP compared to 60% in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has barely emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continued decline in exports and a weakening of consumer demand.
“The bottom line is that as prices rise, people in the middle and bottom [income range] will be looking for ways to replenish their income wherever they can,” said Song Seng Woon, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Record-high gold prices over the past two years have intensified the rush with which people put their personal belongings on, as they take advantage of the opportunity to get money for their family jewellery.
In Singapore, about 70 per cent of the goods deposited at 200 city-state pawnshops are gold.
People say, “The price of gold looks good, let’s put on Grandma’s gold chain and get it back next month.”
In Thailand, the largest pawnshop operator EasyMoney has seen an increase in the number of customers using its office in recent months, up to 20%.
Growth in the pawnshop business is such that ValueMax, a branch operator in Bendemir and 15 others in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighboring Malaysia, where it has four stores, but also outside Asia, says Yeah Li Ching, CEO of ValueMax.
The company will finance the expansion using 60 percent of the S$66 million raised this week as a result of the placement of shares on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some lenders have sparked criticism because of high interest rates, Ms Yeah says the pawnshop not only offers cheaper rates than other lenders, it also does not increase debt directly.
“Customers are putting up items they already own, and monetizing personal assets doesn’t increase household debt,” she says.
The institution is gaining increasing public recognition as a means to obtain short-term, secured financing.
And at the same time, pawnshops are used not only by those categories of people who are in a difficult financial situation.
Wealthy people in Singapore also use ValueMax offices, laying gold bars or Rolex watches, which can give up to 60 percent of their purchase value in cash.
We see clients from all walks of life.
“They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow money for short-term commercial projects or investments, or small businesses who need to overcome temporary monetary difficulties,” says Ms Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Today, it is not the number of existing medical facilities and their status that matter to the population, but the quality of medical care provided.
Implementation of the program "Modernization of health care of the Tula region for 2011 - 2013", the reorganization of medical institutions of our city will allow to create an optimal structure of medical care to the population, including gynecological patients, pregnant women and congenital mothers.
Thus, after the association with the humpback whale, there was an even greater opportunity to attract narrow specialists from the NHKB University for consultations of pregnant women with various pathologies, to carry out additional examinations on the basis of the hospital.
During the implementation of the modernization program, the logistical and technical base of the maternity home was significantly improved, and modern equipment conforming to world standards appeared.
Over these years, about 8 million rubles have been allocated for overhaul of premises, 112 units of equipment worth 42 million rubles have been purchased.
The most modern equipment is equipped with an intensive fast for newborns.
In the operating room, during the caesarean section, the "Sell-Sewer" device is used, which allows you to collect blood from the surgical wound and after special treatment to return it to the nasal cavity, avoiding transfusion of foreign blood.
Modern equipment is also equipped with a department of clinical and laboratory diagnostics.
In the women's consultation, the electronic registry functions, in the near future it is planned to introduce electronic cards and histories of patients.
Thanks to the development of telemedicine, it was possible to consult gynecological patients, pregnant women, newborns and newborns with regional specialists.
Chechens beat and rob 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg
Chechens have been arrested by French police on suspicion of serial assaults on prostitutes.
The investigation has been ongoing since March of this year.
About 60 women complained about the actions of the Caucasians.
The bandits reportedly ordered prostitutes to one of the Strasbourg hotels, and then beat and rob them.
The head of the gang was a 27-year-old former Chechen national.
Bayern defender David Alaba became Austria’s top athlete in 2013, according to the official website of the Bundesliga.
In this dispute, he overtook the representatives of winter sports, which have traditionally become the best in the country.
The second place was taken by the skier Marcel Hirscher, and the third - the ski jumper from the trampoline Gregor Schlirenzauer.
Last season, the 21-year-old Austrian of Filipino-Nigerian origin helped his team win the Champions League, the Championship and the German Cup, as well as the UEFA Super Cup.
Arshavina's ex-wife rests with actor Andre Chadov
Former civilian wife of Peter Zenit footballer Andrey Arshavin Yulia Baranovskaya spends the holiday together with actor Andrey Chadov.
Yulia rests in Italy in the company of the actress Anastasia Zadorozhna, her fiancé - the figure skater Sergei Slavnov, and the actor Andrei Chadov.
Photos from the joint walks of couples published on Instagram Anastasia Zadorozhna.
This is not the first photo of Andrea and Julia.
On October 5, Zadrozhnaya published a photo in which the couple stands hugging on the shore of the Gulf of Finland in Komarovo.
In mid-October, Zenit's chieftain Andrei Arshavin admitted that he lives apart from his civilian wife Julia.
Yulia Baranovska and Andrei Arshavin have been together since 2003, they have three children.
Recently it became known that Arshavin is dating the ex-model Alisa Kazmina.
Arshavin's new girlfriend was married to a top manager of the corporation.
$325 million rescue package for Tasmanian health care
The federal government insists that the $325 million rescue package for Tasmania’s weakened health care system will be supplemented by tough conditions that ensure the state government doesn’t waste money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is taking “urgent measures” to prevent the crisis caused by the island state’s aging population, higher levels of chronic diseases and systemic restrictions.
The decision on funding for four years was made after consultations of the government with the independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has proposed a package of emergency rescue measures that we believe will solve the specific problems facing the state,” said Ms. Plibersek.
The $325 million package includes $31 million per flash campaign for planned operations.
Another 2,600 surgeries, including orthopedic and cataract removal operations, will help overcome the lag.
There is also money for clinics accepting patients without prior registration, in Hobart and Longston, to improve the quality of post-hospital care, training of health professionals, mental health services and the implementation of personal electronic medical card systems in local hospitals.
“These investments will go to the advanced doctors to implement ideas on how best to help the health care system in Tasmania,” said Ms. Plibersek.
The Minister insisted that the Government of Tasmania will work under strict accountability and accountability.
The State will need to maintain current funding levels in order to receive Community funds, and report monthly on where it spends those additional funds.
A three-person commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides services as efficiently and effectively as possible.
Mr Wilkie said today that $325 million will not solve anything unless they are followed by a genuine reform that will put Tasmania’s health care system on a more sustainable basis.
However, he commended the government for its response to his request for urgent assistance, with which he first approached the Prime Minister in early May.
“I hope that the federal aid package will contribute significantly to the removal of this state’s health care system from a critical condition,” Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional screening procedures largely offset recent cuts.
But federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today’s statement is a “solution similar to leukoplasty.”
“The reason we’re here is because the state’s Labour government has stolen $430 million from the health care system,” he told ABC TV.
When the state government takes out nearly half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth invests 300 million, you can’t pretend that’s good news.
Mr. Dutton asked Ms. Plibersek to ensure that not a single dollar of the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicla’s portrayal of Deni Diderot may boast exceptional staging and historical details, but it’s also more difficult to perceive than it should have been.
The film, which takes place in France in the 1760s, tells the dark story of Susanna, a young aristocrat sent to a monastery by her family.
When she starts to rebel, she experiences extreme cruelty at the hands of a sadistic boss and becomes the object of erotic fantasies for others.
The film never goes down to oblivion or sensation – and that’s the problem.
Because of its serious solemnity, the narrative risks becoming a test for the audience as well as a hairdresser.
Syria Destroys Its Chemical Weapons, Says Monitoring Group
Syria destroyed key equipment for the production of chemical weapons and poison gas munitions, an international watchdog said on Thursday, while fierce clashes raged in the north of the country, near one of the facilities where toxic substances are believed to be stored.
Also on Thursday, a group of Syrian activists said more than 120,000 people had been killed since the start of the civil war in the country almost three years ago.
A statement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made one day before
the deadline of 1 November set by the Hague-based organization for Damascus to destroy or “disable” all means of chemical weapons production and mechanisms for mixing chemicals with poisonous gas and filling them with munitions.
The completion of what is essentially the initial stage of destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious schedule that aims to destroy all of Damascus’ chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Nevertheless, Damascus has yet to begin the destruction of existing weapons and stockpiles.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and nerve gas sarin.
The statement was made during fierce fighting Thursday in the city of Safira, which experts say is home to a chemical weapons facility as well as its storage location, the UK-based Syrian Centre for Human Rights said.
A group of activists who tracked the losses through a network of activists in Syria said on Thursday that 120,296 people were killed.
Of this number, 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
The government said 29,954 people are members of President Bashar al-Assad’s armed forces, 18,678 are pro-government militants and 187 are Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Also among the dead, the statement said, were 2,202 army defectors and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
According to the UN estimate of 25 July, 100,000 people have died in the conflict since March 2011.
Since then, this figure has not been updated.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops fought in Safira for weeks with rebels, many of whom are affiliated with al-Qaeda groups.
The center said on Thursday there were casualties on both sides, but did not provide specific data.
The battles underlined the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, adjusted for the tight deadlines of their mission to rid Syria of a toxic arsenal in the midst of an ongoing civil war.
The OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, said its team was “now satisfied that it has checked and destroyed all of Syria’s declared critical production facilities and mixing/refueling equipment.”
She added that “no additional inspection activities are currently being planned.”
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of verification work by visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the two sites for security reasons, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW said both sites were, according to Syria’s statement, “abandoned and ... the chemical weapons program items contained in them were moved to other claimed sites that were checked.”
It was not immediately possible to determine whether the facility in Safira was one of two places that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which is due to be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
“I welcome the courage and courage that you all have shown in carrying out the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization,” said Ahmet Uzumju, Director-General of the Monitoring Group, in a commentary published by the OPCW.
For the third year of the civil war, rebels, mostly Sunni Muslims, have clashed with the Assad government and its security forces, which consist of members of its Alawite sect, a branch of Shia Islam.
As for the other events, the head of the center, Rami Abdurrahman, said there was a strong explosion on Wednesday at the air defense facility in the coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Anger over sentencing of the organizers of the terrorist attack in Bali
The survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing reacted furiously to the sentence handed down by the last of the conspirators who appeared before the court and said that Umar Patek should be shot.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for his role in creating explosive devices used during the attack.
He may be released for 15 years if he is granted parole.
The 45-year-old defendant was found guilty of mass murder as a result of an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, in which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and dozens more were injured.
He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorism-related charges, including the wave of explosions of churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors have demanded a life sentence, although they could insist that a person called a "subversive" for his reputation as a master of explosives must be sentenced to death.
The decision aggravated the painful memories of a mother from Perth, June Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in a terrorist attack by Patek and his accomplices nearly a decade ago.
Hardly holding back tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
“I really think he should follow in the footsteps of other guys.
He has to appear before the shooting team, said Mrs. Cortin AAP.
“I have to live every day knowing that I won’t have grandchildren and I won’t see my daughters.”
The Sari club was destroyed when a massive explosive device parked in an outside van was put into operation just after 11 p.m. on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy bar, where a suicide bomber blew up a backpack filled with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
After this attack, he fell into a coma for a month and "died" three times, being connected to the life support system.
Mr Hughes said Patek should share the fate of three other members of the Jemaa Islamia terrorist cell responsible for the bloody massacre, Amrozi, Muhlasa and Imam Samudra, who were executed four years ago.
Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty the most.
To save his life, well, there's no reason to save his life.
To get 20 years after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds is not that much.
Patek is the last participant in the Bali terror attack to be brought to justice.
He hid for nearly a decade, but was eventually detained in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. troops killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent showed that the intelligence data showed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an attempt to restore ties between the terrorist groups of Southeast Asia and Al Qaeda.
“He didn’t give up,” Mrs. Cortin said.
Until recently, he did not regret how much grief he caused to other people.
The verdict comes on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attack, which will be celebrated later this year in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of tears this year,” says Mrs. Cortin.
Patek can still appeal his sentence.
FAU: “Air passengers can now use gadgets on airplanes (but not to call from a mobile phone)”
Air passengers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not to talk on mobile phones, according to long-awaited new guidelines released Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
However, passengers should not expect changes to occur immediately.
How quickly such a change is implemented will vary depending on the airline, FAU administrator Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
Airlines will have to show the FAU how their planes meet the new guidelines and that they are updating their flight crew training manuals and device laying rules to comply with the new guidelines.
The FAU said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that have already presented their plans.
“Depending on the status of the plan, we could approve the expansion of the use of electronic devices very soon,” the FAU said.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft door closes.
They should not restart them until the plane reaches a height of 10,000 feet and the captain does not give "good".
Passengers should turn off their devices again when the aircraft is lowered for landing, and not turn them on until the aircraft is on the ground.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are adequately protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use these devices during take-off, landing and flight, the FAU said.
Most new airliners and other aircraft modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at high altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Guides, welcomed these changes.
“Once the new policy is successfully implemented (and we are going to work closely with the carrier to achieve this) it will be a win-win option,” Glading said.
We are frankly tired of feeling “duty at school” when it comes to this issue.
But Internet access for surfing, sharing emails, text messages or uploading data will still be banned at a height of less than 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to airplane mode.
Thus, still no "Words with Friends" - an intelligent online game, in which the actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when there was a rumored case: the actor was removed from the aircraft of the airline American Airlines for refusing to turn off the device at the time when the plane.
And heavier devices, such as laptops, will still need to be stored in the luggage compartment, as they can injure someone if they fly around the cabin.
Calls from mobile phones in flight will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory authority for telephone calls belongs to the Federal Communications Commission, not to the FAU.
FAU may lift ban on some electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Council, a national transportation safety expert at CBS News, said mobile phones were still considered a risk.
“Cell phones are really a problem, not only because they could potentially create interference for navigation devices, but we know from the FCC that they can create interference for cell towers when the plane is in the air,” Rosenker said.
A sectoral advisory committee set up by the FAU to study the issue recommended last month that the government allow more widespread use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, there has been an increase in pressure on FAUs to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as Missouri Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill, argue that there are no compelling security reasons for the bans.
Compliance with restrictions is also becoming increasingly difficult to ensure, as the use of devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore the instructions to turn off their devices.
The FAU began restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to reports of interference with navigation and communication equipment when passengers began carrying FM radio receivers — high-tech gadgets of the time.
New airliners are much more reliant on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also developed and approved by the FAU as resistant to electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi at cruising altitude for several years now.
Airplanes modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of liners have been adapted for wider use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today’s electronic devices typically emit radio signals of much lower power than previous generations of devices.
Devices for reading e-books, for example, emit only minimal signals when scrolling pages.
But the signals become more powerful when devices load or send data.
Among those who sought to ease restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers was the company Amazon.com.
In 2011, representatives of the company loaded an entire airliner with their Kindle e-book reader devices and flew on it to check for problems, but never detected them.
Members of the FAU Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about whether the use of the devices posed any risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Airline Passengers Association said he believes interference from the devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the committee said there were only individual pilots' messages confirming that the devices could create interference for aviation systems, and most of these messages are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAU allow pilots to require passengers to disable the devices during landings on the devices in conditions of limited visibility.
A group of representatives of the tourism industry welcomed these changes, calling them a sensible step towards passengers who are now using many technological devices.
“We are pleased that the FAU recognizes that passenger comfort is not incompatible with safety and security,” said Roger Dow, director general of the U.S. Tourism Association.
Schools will be able to take exams for obtaining driving licenses
Driving license exams will be accepted by private companies that have their own computerized driving licence.
This is written by Kommersant with reference to the draft government decree "On the admission to driving vehicles".
According to the newspaper, there are currently only about 30 such highways in Russia.
It is assumed that students of such "privileged" motor schools will count the results of internal testing.
At the same time, the State Inspectorate will monitor the passing of exams every six months.
If it turns out that more than 30% of the exams in theory and more than 20% of the site students do not pass the first time, such a school will be deprived of privileges for six months.
The technical requirements for the racetracks contained in the draft government decree come into force on November 5, 2014.
The project also contains requirements for training in driving two-wheeled vehicles.
From January 1, 2015, owners of motorcycles will have to pass the exam in urban traffic conditions to obtain category A rights.
In addition, from May 5, 2014, companies will not be able to hire drivers of foreigners with foreign rights.
Such workers will have to receive Russian rights after passing the exam.
Bird, airborne to a safe place from a drilling facility in the North Sea, released back into the wild
The bird, airborne on the shore after it was found in a depleted state on an oil rig in the North Sea, was released back into the wild.
The water cow was placed in a helicopter heading to Aberdeen last month, and then it was taken out by the Scottish branch of the Society for the Prevention of Animal Abuse (SPCA) at a rescue center in Alloa.
Center manager Colin Seddon said: “This water cow is most likely a winter migrant from Northern Europe who has fallen into a zone of strong winds over the North Sea.”
It seems that the bird has become obsessed and was able to find shelter on the oil tower.
He added: “She was not able to take off again, so we asked for help.”
The water cow was healthy and in good condition by the time it was released.
Is Europe’s elite ready to do business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a commitment to bring together business representatives and determine what changes Britain’s wealth and jobs creators want to see in relations with the EU.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts on the UK, business and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business leaders representing a broad range of UK businesses across sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will come as a surprise to many.
We have found that the vast majority of businesses are currently looking for export opportunities outside of Europe, paying particular attention to countries that are upgrading and growing while EU countries are in stagnation.
They want the government to prioritize new trade ties with countries like China, India and Brazil, rather than wasting time on the long and difficult process of reforming the EU’s messy institutions.
When asked about their views on specific policy issues, from antitrust regulation to product laws, most business leaders felt that control over these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, with business representatives saying that the costs of regulation from Brussels now outweigh the benefits of being in the European trading zone, even 40 percent of large enterprises, traditionally the most pro-European of all companies, agreed.
Last but not least, our survey of business leaders revealed that a clear majority want the UK to pursue a course of treaty change and EU relations based on trade rather than politics.
This result, which has been observed among enterprises of all sizes and the largest business groups, shows that the business is insisting on a “significant change” that will bring power back to the UK.
High rates – Achieving treaty changes and more favourable conditions for the UK will provide a 16 percent shift in voting to stay in the EU.
The prime minister should have no doubt: this poll shows that British business supports his plan to revise the terms of Britain’s EU membership.
It also shows that the business expects the revision to lead to a significant shift in the current balance of power back towards the UK.
The best conditions for British business are possible and becoming increasingly necessary as the euro area embarks on a path of closer economic and financial integration.
Priority should be given to jobs and economic growth in the UK, and, as the results of our survey show, for businesses this means a stronger focus on trade and fundamental changes in Brussels’ regulatory activities.
U.S. Secret Service Intercepts Pope’s Personal Phone
The activities of the Vatican are under the watchful control of the American intelligence services.
New documents from Edward Snowden’s collection show that U.S. intelligence has been listening to all of Pope Benedict’s previous talks, and is now closely caring for Pope Francis.
His phone started ringing even before he became the head of the Vatican.
The process of electing a new pope was also under observation.
What is important in the United States?
The special services connected to the cell phones of the cardinals, who gathered in Rome to choose another Pope.
The telephones of the residence where the participants of the conclave lived were also heard.
American spies auditioned all the main contenders for the papal throne to prevent the appearance of an unwelcome figure for Washington.
Panorama magazine writes that the “big ear of the United States” continued to intercept the conversations of the prelates until the conclusion of the conclave on March 12.
In the United States, since 2005, Argentinian Archbishop Bergolio has been designated as the future Pope of Rome.
U.S. intelligence has also been tracking negotiations related to the election of the new president of the Vatican Bank.
The Italian magazine writes that a secret group of CIA and NSA operatives working in the Roman Embassy continues to extract information about policies and financial flows.
In turn, the Vatican has reconciled that it does not care about the American “listening”, even if it happens.
The U.S. leadership has no secrets from the Holy Fathers.
The snowboarder for the Olympic ticket was specially photographed
The Bank of Russia on Wednesday issued a commemorative banknote dedicated to the city of Sochi, where already this winter the Olympic Games will be held.
The denomination of the bill is 100 rubles.
But on the net, bloggers are already actively ironic about the commemorative banknote.
After the presentation of the Olympic banknote on October 30, they drew attention to the fact that the image of the snowboarder from the banknote can be found in the photo banks.
In particular, in the free stock photo repository StockExchange, where this photo is dated 2005.
The same photo is used in a lesson on Photoshop, published on the Russian site Megaobzor on January 18, 2011.
In addition, it has already been used in the advertising of smartphones RugGear.
The Olympic banknote is made in blue-blue range.
On the one hand, the snowboarder flying over Sochi is depicted, on the other hand, the view of the Olympic stadium and the Birdstrap.
The author of the design of the banknote is Pavel Bushuev, who won the competition among students of the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts named after Repin.
The presentation noted that several sports were considered - skiing, freestyle and jumping with a trampoline, but in the end chose snowboarding, as it is a relatively young sport.
According to Izvesti, a source close to the Central Bank, the regulator is not indifferent to the public opinion about the widespread distribution of the image of a snowboarder from an Olympic banknote and is now studying the situation.
But in Goznak are not too worried about the noise around the Olympic banknote.
The head of the press service of the State Trademark Natalia Nikiforova told Izvestia that all the arguments about plagiarism are ridiculous.
The snowboarder on the banknote turned right, in the photos on the network - to the left, - Nikiforova specified.
The person at the photo session to create the bill was taken from different points, then the final image was selected, on it - a characteristic position of a snowboarder.
She also noted that the copyright laws do not apply to the Olympic banknote, as the artist was paid for the work.
According to experts, the discussion around the image on the Olympic bill is quite positive.
Recognition of the image on the banknote - plus for its promotion, - believes the executive director of NP "RusBrand" Alexey Popovichev.
Proving the one hundred percent similarity of images on a banknote and in photo banks is quite difficult, so claims to challenge intellectual property for this image are unlikely to arrive.
The first Olympic banknote appeared in China - a commemorative banknote of 10 yuan was issued at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
Russia has decided to support this tradition.
Legislative bans forced Russians to drink less beer
Russian beers are in a bad mood.
According to them, the consumption of beer in the country next year will remain at the same level, and this is at best.
Initially, businessmen were looking for growth.
After all, this year is not a success for them: sales fell by 7 percent.
All this was told by the head of one of the largest brewing companies of the country, the Chairman of the Council of the Union of Russian Brewers Isaac Sheps at the third annual conference of the Adam Smith Institute "Commodities of daily demand in Russia", which just ended in Moscow.
It discussed the state regulation of the market.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has already contracted by 18 percent, as in recent years the country has seen a significant strengthening of the regulation of the brewing industry in terms of the production and turnover of beer - a drink with a low alcohol content, - Sheps told listeners.
No country in the world has such a severe restriction on the beer market, the unpredictable introduction of new and new illogical prohibitions, which are justified by the alleged fight against alcohol abuse.
The brewer noted that many legislative bans aimed at reducing the level of alcohol abuse do not have a particular impact, however, new initiatives are constantly emerging.
The most painful of all beer producers hit the ban on selling alcohol in kiosks since this year.
“We immediately lost 35,000 consumers,” Isaac Sheps said.
The brewers have two forecasts for next year.
Optimistic is the one that Shepps was talking about: sales of sparkling drinks will remain at the same level.
Pessimistic - will fall another 2-3 percent.
To save their profits, businessmen are forced to leave the varieties designed for the mass consumer, in the class of "premium": beer will become less, but it will cost more.
Meanwhile, the radical consequences of falling sales with a small amount of alcohol are not yet visible.
“According to my observations, the level of diseases due to alcoholism remains at about the same level,” said narcologist Alexei Sotnikov.
True, the proportion of patients who consume surrogates of strong drinks, as well as those who "possessed" on alcohol-containing tonics such as "Jaguar", while ten years ago, "beer" alcoholism prevailed.
In September, 600 people were fired from the Ford car plant in Vsevolozhsk.
As they say in the trade unions, all fired have received compensation.
However, much more acute than the problems of workers, the question of reducing industrial production in the region arises.
Deputy of the regional Zaksa Alexey Etmanov at the meeting said that at the plant of the company "Ford" in Vsevolozhsk reduced about 600 people.
According to him, it happened in September: then under the program of voluntary dismissal, which was developed together with the union of the organization, about 600 people left the plant.
Workers who decided to quit voluntarily were offered “golden parachutes” in the amount of several salaries.
As a result, the vast majority of them left their jobs on their own.
However, according to Etmanov, such a number of people is a whole night shift.
I don't think that's all it's gonna take.
However, in the next two years, the authorities do not plan to adopt any programs to support regional enterprises in a difficult situation," he explained, adding that when adopting the budget, the government does not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and the large reduction in jobs.
In Ford, this information is not denied or confirmed.
We are waiting for a response from the company, and as soon as it appears, we will definitely publish it.
Talks about the reduction of workers at the Ford plant in Vsevolozhsk have been going on for a long time.
For example, the company’s plans to fire 600 people became known in September.
Earlier, the plant announced the suspension of the production of cars.
As a reason, the plant called the fall in demand for cars "Ford" in Russia.
According to Petrostat, after the results of nine months of 2013, the volume of industrial production in Lenoblasti decreased by 5.4%.
Production of vehicles and equipment decreased by 11.5%.
In the United States, you can use mobile phones during take-off and landing of the aircraft.
New rules for the safe use of mobile devices during take-off and landing of the airliner have been approved in the United States, according to the BBC.
US airlines are expected to allow passengers to use smartphones and tablets throughout the flight, the new rules will come into effect by the end of 2013.
However, communication with the Internet for receiving and sending e-mails will be prohibited during flights at an altitude of less than 3 kilometers.
Due to the danger of interference with aircraft radio equipment, cellular voice communication will still be banned.
In this way, passengers will be allowed to read e-books, play games on tablets and other gadgets and watch videos during domestic and international flights.
Before the rules are adopted, airlines will be required to check the safety of using electronic devices throughout the flight.
In addition, airlines will have to convince the U.S. Federal Civil Aviation Administration that they will be able to cope with the supposed impact of mobile on aircraft and aircraft controls.
According to the source, for example, the United States, in the UK, it is also possible to revise the current rules for the use of electronic devices in flights.
The Russian mafia in the United States has finally established a new name - "Brother's Circle"
This week, the blacklist of the “Russian mafia” in America was replenished with new names and four companies.
The U.S. Treasury Department has introduced into the Brotherhood three representatives of Russia, two citizens of Uzbekistan and an Israeli.
One of the Russians turned out to be the famous singer Grigory Leps, whom the United States is suspected of transporting money for members of the group.
In total, 22 people involved in the Brotherhood and six affiliated organizations are on the U.S. blacklist.
However, many experts doubt that such an organization really exists.
“The statement about the Brotherhood is more like an attempt to unite disparate criminal groups,” said Mark Galeotti, an expert on organized crime and a professor at the University of New York.
In his opinion, the "Brother's Circle" reflects the popular perception of the "Russian mafia".
“I have not met anyone in the Russian law enforcement agencies or anywhere else who would confirm the existence of such a criminal organization,” said Mr. Galeotti of the Center for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
Mr. Galeotti and Professor Liz Shelley of George Mason University agree.
“If they act together, it’s more like a criminal network, but not an organization,” the Center for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime said.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotti suggested that the "Brother's Circle" more closely aligns the Russian thief in the law of Aslan Usoyan, known as Father Hassan.
The criminal authority was assassinated in January of this year.
Thus, the activities of Lasha Shushanashvili and Zakhariya Kalashova, who supplemented the list in 2012, were closely related to Father Hassan, and another participant on the list, Temuri Mirzoev, was the nephew of Father Hassan.
However, Mr. Galeotti notes that some personalities are not related to Usoyan.
In his opinion, all of them were more united by common financial and criminal interests, for example, the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal surrounding the inclusion of Grigory Leps - the beloved singer of Russian President Vladimir Putin - in the "Brother's Circle" attracted the attention of the Kremlin.
Naturally, we expect that we will receive more detailed information from our American counterparts, in connection with which such a decision was made, why it was included in such lists, - said the spokesman of the head of state Dmitry Peskov.
In any case, he (Leps) is a citizen of the Russian Federation.
As well as the interests of all Russian citizens, his interests will be protected.
The head of Gazprom Alexey Miller says that the pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new era in the gas sphere
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, the head of Gazprom said.
“Today there was a landmark event: the construction of the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, began,” Gazprom Chairman Alexey Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is designed to diversify Russia’s export routes across Europe.
The dispute over the contract between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which contains most of Russia’s gas destined for Europe, increases the level of risk for conventional routes, officials say.
Miller said that a direct connection with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated "forever".
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at a reduced price as soon as the entire project starts working in 2015.
Gazprom said construction should begin in other countries further along the gas pipeline route by the end of the year.
The annual project capacity of the pipeline is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
This morning in the Saratsk district, the driver of the car "Peugeot" drove to the opposite lane on 115 km of the Odessa-Renya route, and encountered a bus, in which there were six people.

Two YMCA employees charged with sex crimes before charges against Jonathan Lord, as the Royal Commission became aware
Two YMCA NSW employees were charged with child sexual offences prior to the indictment in 2011 of a child care worker at Caringbach Jonathan Lord, the Royal Commission on Sexual Violence against Children said.
But the commission’s introductory statement said it had “never dealt with cases of sexual violence against children within its organization.”
Chief Executive Philippe Heir was asked about one case when a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography crimes and about another case when a gym instructor at YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sex crimes against children under his supervision in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gale Ferness, a lawyer who assisted the commission, that he knew about the first case but did not know about the second.
He acknowledged that the YMCA in its introductory speech to the commission also admitted inaccuracy, claiming that “there were external YMCA checks that recognized that the YMCA is at the forefront of child safety.”
The evidence presented by the commissions indicates that the YMCA has been notified that it has received the second of four possible evaluations from the end of the quality audit conducted by the Department of Education and Communities in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who joined the YMCA at the age of 21, acknowledged that he and the lower management had failed in hiring Lord and had failed to provide staff with a clear understanding of their obligations regarding reporting child safety policy violations.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sex crimes against 12 boys during two years of his work at the YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
But Mr. Hare rejected the suggestion that YMCA’s corporate ethics prevented employees from reporting Lord’s violations of child safety.
Employees testified that they observed the violations, including that Lord was alone with the children, personally cared for them, put them on his knees, said that he loved one of them and allowed them to play with their mobile phone.
Danielle Oakwell, who was under Lord’s leadership and asked to be trained to protect children because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that she found Jackie Barnatt, the child care manager at the YMCA in Caringbach, who was Lord’s head, “very frightening and often difficult to handle.”
The Executive Director said he did not accept staff explanations that it was embarrassing for them to report the situation to their senior executives.
Rather, according to him, their friendship with the Lord led them away from the thought of the need to communicate about him.
Mr. Hare said he presented his opinion to the YMCA Board of New South Wales that the lesson for the organization from the “incident with Jonathan Lord” is not “involving the provision of information” by employees, and the Board agreed with it.
Mr. Hare stated that the decision to force employees to sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the charges were made was made by the YMCA’s Director General for Child Custody, Liam Whitley.
He said that this was meant to prevent the corruption of evidence, but at the same time “overburdened” and this decision was poorly implemented.
The New South Wales YMCA was not a child-safe organization while working with Jonathan Lord during the 2009-2011 period, according to the commission’s Child Abuse Expert Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University.
He said there were “serious problems” in recruiting, selecting, instructing, training and monitoring staff.
Hearings are postponed until December 20.

Tony Blair said he would seize a chance to return as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, but admits that a return is unlikely.
Last night, in an interview on the fifth anniversary of his resignation, the 59-year-old politician outlined his views on various aspects of domestic policy.
Since retiring in June 2007, after ten years as leader, Blair has largely avoided discussing British politics, limiting most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as ambassador to the four Middle East peacekeepers.
Asked if he would return to the post of Prime Minister, Blair, according to the London Evening Standard, said: "Yes, of course, but it's unlikely to happen, so ..."
Milan head coach Massimiliano Allegri expressed regret over the result of the match of the 10th round of the championship of Italy with Lazio.
The specialist also noted that the failures at the start are due to a series of injuries to leading players.
“I’m very sorry that we failed to win,” Allegri said.
The team played a good match, creating 3-4 good opportunities.
In the first half, we didn't let Lazio do anything.
In the second Roman added, but in general I can not say that we have lost concentration.
We had to win.
“Last season we completed the task of getting into the Champions League.
We are now behind schedule, but this is due to a series of injuries to key players.
Rami and Honda?
They are very good players, with character.
However, our composition is still good.
Take a look at Kaka, who held a high-level meeting.
The experts of the sporting events going to Cardiff to fight for the Horse of the Year prize knew that the competition would be very high.
But no one was ready for the appearance of three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even a schoolboy, just a few months before he took his first steps, this kid with his pet Shetland pony Toffy sledged through three laps to easily take the top prize, leaving 30 adult rivals far behind.
This inseparable pair – of equal growth – received high marks for appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition, which is held by the Sunnybank equestrian centre in the town of Radley near Cardiff.
Going public against the backdrop of men and women in elegant hats, he shifted his cap and proudly spent the circle of two-year-old Toffy.
The judges praised Fenton for his not at all developed congenital ability to handle horses.
And Toffy received the highest rating for his appearance and character.
Fenton was gifted by Toffy on his third birthday in March last year, and since then he has been practicing Shetland pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother Donna said, “Fenton and Toffy are a great duo.”
They had a lot of rivals, but these two left with a gold cup and a chip.
It was just his second performance with Toffy, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Completely unfamiliar people in the arena considered him so phenomenal that they wanted to take a picture with him.
This boy from the village of Nantiglo, near Abb Vale in South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been exhibiting horses for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said: “The whole audience was shocked, and everyone was shouting approving shouts and clapping.”
He ran on the sand all over the length of the arena and, although he looked so tiny, did his job perfectly.
Fenton is crazy about animals — he loves horses, tractors and farms, and he has two chickens he cares about.
Judging by how he started, he’ll be taking part in Horse of the Year soon – and I’m sure he’ll be performing well.
A representative for this annual horse show said, “Fenton has only been around for three years, but he knows how to handle his pony.”
Together they are a great team.
The judges noted Fenton and Toffy for their appearance and for how they presented themselves in the show ring.
They appreciate the consistency of the pony and the breeder's performance - Fenton and Toffy were the best in the ring.
I’m sure Fenton was helped by his attractive outfit, he really looked good in his role.
Chinese newspaper’s published call “should be reorganized”
The Chinese newspaper, which published a first-line call for the release of a reporter accused of libel, should be reorganized, the regulator said.
The Guangzhou-based New Express newspaper made an unexpected public statement calling for the release of journalist Chen Yunzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he took bribes for writing fake articles about a company with a state-owned stake.
Now the “New Express” should go through “the process of complete error correction”, as reported by the regulator.
The order to “correct errors” came from the Guangdong Administration in the field of press and publications, radio, film and television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the Yangcheng Evening News Group newspaper New Express published several false reports about the exchange-registered company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The editorial board of the New Express has been disoriented,” the regulator said in a statement.
He said it had been decided to “mandate administrative retaliation against Chen Yunzhou in the form of a revocation of his reporter’s license.”
He also “instructed the Yangcheng Evening News Group to make a full correction to the errors in the New Express and recommended that it conduct an investigation into those responsible for the situation of the newspaper and make immediate changes to the leadership of the New Express.”
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express, in which he claimed financial violations in the company’s construction equipment business called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, his newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page, saying that it supports his journalistic activities.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on state television with the acknowledgment that he had published fake articles for money.
“In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion, as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to earn public trust,” he told state broadcaster CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was thirsty for money and fame.
I realized my guilt.
After Mr. Chen’s confessions, the New Express published apologies on the front page, saying that the newspaper failed to properly check his reports.
Recently, several high-ranking suspects made confessions on television.
Experts say the practice of breaking confessions in China is still widespread, despite recent amendments to laws prohibiting authorities from forcing anyone to self-recognize.
U.S.-Mexico Drug Transfer Tunnel Detected With Own Railroad
Found one of the most complex tunnels for drug smuggling between the United States and Mexico, equipped with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail system.
The U.S. authorities have described this four-by-three-foot-wide tunnel as one of the most complex secret walks they have ever discovered.
This tunnel, whose zigzags make up the length of almost six football fields, connects the warehouses near the city of Tijuana (Mexico) and San Diego (USA).
This area is filled with imperceptible warehouses, which facilitates the hidden loading of drugs into trucks.
The tunnel was closed before any narcotics were unnoticed, authorities said.
According to court documents, law enforcement officials confiscated eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine when they discovered the tunnel.
The three men, who according to law enforcement officials were working as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine for distribution.
In the event of conviction, they face imprisonment from 10 years to life imprisonment.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use extensive underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passageway discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Several of the largest tunnels were discovered in Central Mexico after harvesting marijuana in October, which put the drug cartels on a difficult task of delivering their product to consumers quickly.
In 2010, authorities found a pass about 700 yards long, equipped with railroads that ran from the kitchen of one of the houses in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Pensions have been increasing in Belarus since November.
Pensions have been increasing in Belarus since November this year, the Belta correspondent in the main pension management of the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection told.
From 1 November of this year, the adjustment of the average wage of workers in the republic applied in the previous recalculation of pensions will be made, with an increase of its value by 5.4% and a corresponding recalculation of labor pensions will be made in accordance with the decree of 21 October 2013 on the increase No. 478.

The average pension by age will be Br2 million 295 thousand.
The increase in pensions will affect 2.4 million inhabitants of the republic.
The expenditure of the Fund for Social Protection of the Population of the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of Belarus for the payment of pensions in increased amounts from November this year will increase to Br274.3 billion per month.
Simultaneously with the recalculation of labour pensions in November of this year, minimum and social pensions, allowances, increases and supplementary pensions will be recalculated due to the increase in the budget of the subsistence minimum per capita.
The BPM for the period from 1 November 2013 to 31 January 2014 was approved by the Government in the amount of Br1 million 47 thousand 530 - by 2.1% higher than the one in force in the period from 1 August to 31 October.
Accordingly, from November 1, the amount of minimum labour pensions, social pensions and allowances, increases and allowances to pensions will be increased by 2.1%.
In Belarus, more than Br53 trillion was allocated for the payment of pensions, taking into account increases in 2013
British police hand Assange extradition notice <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
British police today issued notice of the extradition of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who took refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London and requested asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had handed over to the 40-year-old Australian a “official demand to surrender” with a demand to appear at the police station, adding that in the event of non-compliance, he would continue to be subject to arrest.
Assange is facing extradition to Sweden on sexual crimes charges after he ran out of options under British law when the Supreme Court rejected his extradition appeal earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would hand it over to the United States, he took refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19, asking the South American country for political asylum.
“Scotland Yard has entrusted a 40-year-old man with an official surrender requirement that obliges him to arrive at the police station on the day and time of his choice,” the spokesman said.
He is still violating the terms of bail.
The embassy declined to comment on the delivery of the police notice.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the U.S. to face possible espionage charges after posting more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic posts on the anti-secretary website WikiLeaks.
Driver who drove at 130 miles per hour with a hot drink between his legs is fined <0xC2><0xA3>1000
The driver was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving at speeds up to 130 miles per hour (210 km/h) with a hot drink held between his legs.
The 35-year-old Andrew Howie of Tipperary, Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 route to Braintree on May 27.
When the police stopped him, they found a drink to carry between his legs.
In the Colchester World Court, Howie admitted to the charge of driving without due diligence and attention.
The addition of seven penalty points to his driver’s license resulted in a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also required to pay a cost of <0xC2><0xA3>90 and an additional fee to assist victims of crime of <0xC2><0xA3>100.
Tax for foreign property owners will lead to the fact that the London bubble bursts
The Treasury has carried out a preliminary assessment of the capital gains tax measure, but expects a final decision from Mr. Osborne, who introduced a 7% state duty rate in the 2012 budget for homes worth more than <0xC2><0xA3>2 million and annual payments to buyers who choose not to own homes.
At present, the property tax in Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, which was <0xC2><0xA3>708 million in 2012/13, already exceeds the total in Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northeast, North West, and York.
Mr. Cook said: “After the increase in state duty on expensive homes and the introduction of related anti-avoidance legislation, it is very difficult to argue that the taxation of expensive real estate is undervalued regardless of the impact of the outdated municipal tax system.”
“But this step may result in some foreign investors being reluctant to buy a property in London or its current owners not wanting to sell it,” he added.
The cost of top-notch real estate — the top 5-10% of the housing market by price — in London’s rich southwest belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, rose by a record 11.8% over the past year.
According to a study by Savills, prices in central London continued to show steady growth of 5.6% year-on-year, but they were overshadowed by an actively developing “domestic market” with price spikes in the south-west, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) of the city.
Scientists have shed light on how the dog’s tail movements are related to her mood.
Earlier studies have shown that happy dogs curl their tails to the right (from the dog’s point of view), while anxious dogs curl their tails mostly to the left.
But now scientists say that other members of the dog family may notice these subtle differences in tail swinging and respond to them.
Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trent, says: “It is well known that people on the left and right sides of the brain participate differently in the formation of stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions.”
Here we tried to look at this and other species.
He added that just like humans, dogs have the right side of the brain that controls the left side of the body and vice versa, and the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the versatile intrusions of other dogs’ tails, the researchers observed the animals as they watched movies about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the animals and analyzed their behavior.
We’ll probably soon understand why their tails sometimes point to one side, and sometimes to the other.
Professor Vallortigara said, “We showed dogs videos with dogs — either naturalistic versions or silhouettes to get rid of any other distorting factors, and we could manipulate the movement of the tail and point the tail more to the left or right.”
When the animals saw that the otherwise expressive dog was moving its tail to the right (from the point of view of the wagging dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that the tail leaned mostly to the left (again from the point of view of the dog waving its tail), their heartbeat increased and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think that dogs intentionally communicated with each other through these movements.
In fact, he believes that dogs have learned from their experience what movements they should worry about and which ones they should not.
He notes: “If there are multiple encounters with other dogs, and often their tail tilting to one side is associated with more friendly behavior, and the right side gives less friendly behavior, the dog reacts based on this experience.”
The researchers say these results can give owners, veterinarians, and trainers a deeper understanding of their animal’s emotions.
Dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, an invited research fellow at the University of Bristol’s veterinary school, said this was not the first study to test whether the left and right sides are relevant to dogs.
Last year, a group of scientists at Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads to the left if they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right if they look at a contented dog.
And in another scientific paper at the University of Victoria in Canada, he reported: “Dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when the weaning of its tail was directed to the left, rather than to the right, instead of becoming alarmed, is the opposite behavior toward the Italians.”
He said the differences could be due to the fact that dogs in various studies did not fully perceive animals in films or robot dogs as dogs.
It could be useful to study how dogs react to real dogs, he explained.
“While there is enough evidence across different mammals that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for different purposes, many details have yet to be clarified, and dogs are no exception,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, it is likely that we will soon understand why their tails sometimes point to one side and sometimes to the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpone concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness
The rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed the concert in Glasgow after her vocalist was diagnosed with laryngitis.
The band was due to perform at the city’s Hydro concert venue on Friday.
However, the illness of vocalist Alex Turner forced them to postpone the show.
This statement was made after she was also forced to postpone the concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, Arctic Monkeys said: “After deciding to move the show to the Birmingham LG Arena tonight and after seeking medical help, Arctic Monkeys should also postpone the show at the Hydro site in Glasgow on Friday, November 1st.”
“Alex Turner has been diagnosed with laryngitis and, unfortunately, he is unable to perform.”
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on November 20, and the show in Glasgow at the Hydro arena will take place on November 21.
All tickets to these shows remain valid.

Pope Francis will name the first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals to the Catholic Church for the first time in his term of office on February 22, the Vatican announced on Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and it is they who elect the pope, so Francis will appoint his first group of people who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, after reaching the age of 80, the cardinal can no longer participate in the election of the pope - this is the prerogative of the group of 120 "electoral cardinals".
Announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said that a meeting of all current cardinals, known as the Consistory, would be held before the erection ceremony.
“Pope Francis has decided to announce in advance his decision to convene a Consistory in February in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings with the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinal electors is likely to decline by February.
He said that the pope usually calls as many cardinals as necessary to bring back the number of cardinals-elections to 120, as well as as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wants.
The Consistory next year will be of great importance because it will be the first since the election of Francis in March this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a kind of bias in favour of Europe and especially in favour of Italy.
“It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint cardinals from other regions of the world to restore balance,” he said.
In South America, forty percent of Catholics live, but they are represented by a small number of cardinals.
They will also be the first cardinals to be elected since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with finding ways to reform the church.
In the past, Dad decided everything on his own.
“Now Francis has chosen eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He said that “it is quite possible” that Francis would turn to the cardinals for advice.
But we haven’t been in this situation before — it’s all for us for the first time.
Valero said that the popes were usually appointed as cardinal bishops from major parishes, but Francis was “a pool of surprises – so we don’t know who he would call.”
GM recalls a number of new pickups in the U.S. to refine the back seats
General Motors Co recalls nearly 19,000 all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups to address problems with manual seatback tilt adjustment, according to a notification from U.S. auto safety regulators on Friday.
On some of the pickups, the front seats may have a defect in the mechanism of the inclination of the back.
As a result, the seat backs do not meet the federal standards for vehicle safety on head restraints.
“In the event of a rear impact, the head restraint may not properly protect the driver and passengers, increasing the risk of injury,” a notice posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s website said.
The recalled models were manufactured in the period from August 1 to September 10.
The production of GM pickups began in June and is the most important launch of the car into series production for the leading American automaker since its restructuring due to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed pickup owners of the defect in the first half of October.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration could not consider notifying owners of a 16-day government shutdown that slowed growth in car sales in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra pickups, which have been upgraded for the 2014 model lineup, grew about 20 percent in the first 10 months of this year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM’s stock on the New York Stock Exchange rose 1.4 percent to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
Obama Voter Desperation Scream
I voted for President Obama twice, sharing hope for change.
He says Obama has allowed the obstructionism of Republicans to nullify commendable efforts.
Obstructionism cannot serve as justification for problems with the website of Obama-reformed health care system, drone attacks
The memoirs of the 2008 Obama campaign are a sad reminder of what could have happened.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year medical student at Harvard University.
I read a very sad book these days.
I thought that this book would inspire me in times of despair in the second year of medical school and revive a sense of hope in me.
It’s called “Courage to Win,” and it’s a memoir about Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish writing reports on my patients in the evening and go to bed, this book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and speeches could take a breather.
The victory in the election was impressive, and the news program leaders paused to understand this historic moment.
My classmates were crying for joy, and my parents kept all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of strategists had to come to the White House, and the people were ready for change.
At the time of Obama's inauguration in 2008, his level of support was 82 per cent.
Then I close the book.
A return to the present is a rough awakening, like a pulling out of a dream.
It’s hard to remember those days of optimism — they seem like a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I dropped my first ballot, the changes have really happened.
It was something I couldn't even imagine.
I pay tribute to Obama for his great and diverse achievements, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act to the withdrawal of our military from Iraq, the repeal of the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Say” rule, and the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party obstructionism has blocked too many attempts to advance our country forward: immigration reform, the possibility of choosing public health and the closure of the base in Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo, among others.
But after countless times that I was on the side of the Obama administration, defending it from colleagues and peers, I ran out of explanations that I could provide.
I have reached a point of political desperation.
The obstructionism of Republicans cannot explain the permission to eavesdrop on foreign leaders or strikes by drones on innocent children in other countries.
It cannot explain the collection of U.S. privacy data by the National Security Agency or the prosecution of whistleblowers revealing government wrongdoing.
He cannot explain the killing of American citizen Anwar al-Awlaki without trial and investigation or non-compliance with state funding and spending limits during the presidential campaigns.
He cannot justify the report’s conclusion that the White House’s efforts to silence the media are “the most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration.”
And lately, he can’t justify failing to develop a simple website for more than three years after signing the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if I should have expected that.
Should I have understood at the age of 18 that leadership can contradict the political campaigns that precede it?
Obviously, working in an elected position is not a predictable agenda, as our public dialogue will be shaped by the opposition political party and by such incidental events as the Newtown massacre.
Nevertheless, from all the examples I have listed above, it can be seen that they were largely the administration’s own choice.
And that's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was an incomprehensible and rude alternative, it seemed that he was unable to make a decision on his own policies or views.
I believed that in his second term, Obama, having freed himself from the pressure of future elections, would justify the hopes that we have heard about for such a long time.
However, when Obama’s rating fell below 45% this week, it became much harder to return to 2008 with this book.
It makes me cringe at the many promises that have gone away.
This week, I read that part of the book that describes how Clinton defeated Obama in the primary election in Pennsylvania.
At a meeting to analyze the causes of failure, he told his employees that they should return to normal course and remain faithful to their goal.
“I want us to regain our attractiveness,” he said.
We need to remember who we are.”
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I totally agree with you.

Clive Palmer argues that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in the issue of parental leave.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over childcare leave because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
This mining tycoon, who has an unresolved $6 million carbon tax dispute, made this statement at a time when he was trying to evade questions about whether he has a conflict.
Palmer’s combined party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which may be crucial in deciding to lift carbon and mining taxes.
But Mr. Palmer argued that there could only be a conflict of interest among ministers, and said that Mr. Abbott's daughters would personally benefit from the policy measures.
“He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid childcare leave, because if any of these daughters get pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether they get leave or not,” Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat in the Fairfax constituency with a majority of 53 votes after the counting of the votes.
Mr. Palmer called for a revision of the electoral vote counting procedure to speed up the process.
Daughters of Tony Abbott Francis and Bridget.
Should the decision on these elections be taken two months after we have voted?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why shouldn't we have a system like this so that we can come in, enter our data into the computer, vote right away and get the result at 6:30 p.m. the same night?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils for bulletin boards.
Is it because they can erase the result if someone doesn’t like it?
To use a pencil in our time seems strange.
The Electoral Commission is exploring opportunities for electronic voting and has recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer, 59, said his program includes an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and he would be “very serious” about his new job.
Public office implies service to society.
“We are not seeking any awards other than the gratitude of history for the fact that at a critical moment we can serve this district,” he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has temporarily suspended two traders in its currency operations division, according to two people familiar with the situation, which is another confirmation that global regulatory scrutiny of alleged manipulations in the currency market is rapidly gaining momentum.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in investigations related to the world’s largest financial market, which has a daily turnover of $5.3 trillion.
These two traders will be the first employees of RBS to be removed during an ongoing investigation, which is reminiscent of a scandal related to manipulations of the LIBOR interbank rate.
Refusing to comment on the suspensions, the bank confirmed that it had received requests for information from regulators this month.
“Our ongoing investigation into this issue is ongoing and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other regulators,” the bank said in a statement.
Last month, whistleblowers said RBS had forwarded records of emails and instant messages received and sent by its former trader to the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
This trader, Richard Asher, left RBS in 2010 and is known to have been granted leave of absence for his current position as head of European spot currency trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, went on vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended from work by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any violations.
Mr. Asher’s IM contact group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to insiders.
UBS said this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating alleged currency market manipulations at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six regulators in the world — the European Commission, Finma, Switzerland’s Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority — are considering allegations that bankers have colluded to influence the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also started internal checks or received requests for information from regulators, people familiar with the situation said.
Banks look through instant messages and e-mails for several years in search of cases of offenses.
News of the checks has swelled traders in the area of activity, which in recent years has been one of the largest sources of income of trading units of investment banks, which this year, however, faced difficulties due to the fact that low currency volatility reduces favorable opportunities for buyers.
Some bankers have tried to mitigate the seriousness of the situation by saying that an extensive and highly liquid foreign exchange market is almost impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say this is not always true.
According to the senior trader, despite the huge volume of daily trading in the foreign exchange market, fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and wider use by banks of their domestic platforms means that “you can start to influence the market for a very small price.”
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had fired one of its stock exchange traders at the London Stock Exchange this week, after he caused losses of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank has immediately notified the relevant authorities and cooperates with its regulators.
“We are confident that the trader acted alone and that this issue was localized,” Credit Suisse said.
Supreme Court upholds Obama's health care law
The U.S. Supreme Court today ruled that Barack Obama’s landmark health care law is constitutional, which is a major victory for the Obama administration.
By voting 5 against 4, the judges ruled that certain provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requiring citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014 or pay a fine are constitutional in accordance with the government’s powers on taxation.
Supreme Court President John Roberts joined the four more liberal members of the court, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito, and Kennedy were opposed.
The court also left the remaining sections of this 2,700-page law in force and further ruled that the requirement of the Health Care Act to require states to increase compliance with the requirements of the Medicaid program, otherwise they will lose all federal funding for the Medicaid program, is not unconstitutionally enforceable.
The lawsuit to block the bill was filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was strongly opposed by each of the main Republican presidential candidates during the 2012 primary season, including alleged candidate Mitt Romney.
Football - the cause of different?
In the State Duma, within the framework of the Open Tribune, politicians and experts talked about how to preserve the national peace in Russia.
Among the proposals was the following: to ban football in the North Caucasus, because from this game - some scandals and dissension.
Speaker Sergei Naryshkin recalled the recent events in Biryulev and said that to reduce the "degree of tension in society" politicians and the media must be correct in their statements.
Probably, he meant the recent scandal with Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who in one of the TV shows threatened to surround the Caucasus with barbed wire, if there do not want to limit the birth rate...
All speakers spoke about measures to regulate migration from the CIS countries, and about measures to harmonize relations between the peoples inhabiting Russia, which gave the discussion confusion.
Maxim Grigoriev said that the events in Biryulev are "a model conflict that could be predicted", but "we have too many people and agencies responsible for these questions", and seven babysitters have an eyeless child.
The concept of multiculturalism, which Europe has long practiced with regard to migrants, has failed, in the opinion of the public, and it is necessary to look for its own way.
The historian Yuri Petrov placed great hopes on a new single history textbook.
“It is still necessary to create a handbook on the history of the culture of the peoples of the country, so that schoolchildren in Tatarstan know what kind of people live in Dagestan, and vice versa,” he said.
Gennady Zyuganov proposed to introduce criminal responsibility for "calls to dismember Russia": "If in the United States to say on the radio that it is necessary to give Alaska to Russia, you will be arrested and given 20 years in prison!"
Vladimir Zhirinovsky tried very hard "not to inflame".
As usual, he accused journalists who bring sick and acute national problems to a public discussion of everything: "In the heat of controversy, there is little to say!"
The leader of the faction "United Russia" Vladimir Vasilyev immediately advised journalists to conclude a "paper" and agree to talk about this topic carefully, and then the same commitments can be made by politicians.
We have passed about 30 laws that regulate migration, and the order in general is established, said Mr. Vasilyev.
As an example, he cited a law that places responsibility on regional and municipal authorities for international peace on their territory.
But Lyudmila Andrichenko did not share the enthusiasm about this law: it does not "have a clear idea of what adaptation of migrants is, about its mechanisms and limits.
Thus, subjects will interpret the scope of these powers in different ways.
In addition, municipalities do not have the personnel necessary to solve such complex issues, there are no funds, and the center does not give them methodical recommendations that they could use.
The head of the Duma Committee on Nationalities, Gajimet Safaraliyev, proposed the creation of a special department called the "Ministry of National Security", which would deal with national policy issues.
But Valery Tishkov, who in the 1990s headed a similar department, subsequently abolished, opposed it.
It is sufficient to have at the federal level a special person, a "minister without a portfolio", to whom one could turn, if any.
“We are walking around the country, shells are firing around, it is very important for representatives of different ethnicities and religions to stand up together against provocations, and this work should receive worthy informational support,” said Vsevolod Chaplin, a representative of the Russian Federation for relations with society.
No neutrality of the state with regard to dangerous ideologies, religious including, in his opinion, should be.
Here Oleg Nilov led the discussion in an unexpected direction: "More talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan, still need to be searched, but they are pushed not the way, not the way", - he said.
"Not the road" is the development of football: "The football player is beaten by the whole crowd, the flags are burned, the comrades throw stones at each other...
Maybe we don't need that kind of football?
There is another sport - rugby is called...
"There will be no equals in the world in this kind of sport!" - hotly said provoross.
No one will play rugby in the Caucasus! - immediately Mr. Zhirinovsky intervened.
You'll offer them another curling!
You need to know the national characteristics, it's like offering a Georgian "Zaporozhets"...
In Yaroslavl, representatives of the Moscow club distinguished themselves by wild behavior on the stands - during the game with the local club.
Football has to be banned across the country.
The head of the control and disciplinary committee of the Russian Federation Artur Grigoryants said that "Kuban" is fined 500,000 rubles, reports from the House of football correspondent "SE" Filip Papankov.
Such sanctions against the Krasnodar club were applied for the burning of the flag of Dagestan by fans at the stands during the home game of the 14th round against Anji.
At the meeting were representatives of both clubs, a man from the RFPL.
We looked at all the available materials.
For the illegitimate behavior of the spectators "Kuban" was fined 500,000 rubles.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued for Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, filed a series of patent lawsuits on Thursday against mobile phone makers, including Google, the price of which it interrupted at a bankruptcy auction for Nortel.
The Rockstar consortium, which bought Nortel for $4.5 billion in patents, has filed patent infringement lawsuits in the U.S. District Court in Texas against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
These patents cover technologies that help match search keywords on the Internet with their respective advertising, the lawsuit said, which is the basis of Google’s search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were unavailable and did not comment.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture phones running on Google’s Android operating system, which fiercely competes with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google offered an initial price of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google has raised the price several times, eventually offering as much as $4.4 billion.
After losing the Nortel patent case to the Rockstar consortium, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, with Motorola’s patent library partially determining the deal.
“Despite a failed attempt to purchase patents that are the subject of the lawsuit at auction, Google has violated and continues to violate them,” the lawsuit reads.
Rockstar is demanding increased damages from Google, as it claims that the patent infringement by Google is intentional, according to the lawsuit.
Egypt's first freely elected president takes oath
Mohammed Mursi takes the oath, but the day of his triumph is unlikely to mark the end of the political struggle in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammad Mursi promised a “new Egypt” when he took the oath of office, becoming the country’s first freely elected president, replacing Hosni Mubarak, who was overthrown 16 months ago.
At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and the fifth head of state in Egypt after the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took an oath before 18 black-robed judges in a court building on the banks of the Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,” Mursi said during a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
“Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundations of a new life – absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability,” said Morsi, a 60-year-old American-educated engineer from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been a banned organization for most of the 84 years of its existence.
The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and police when Mursi arrived with a small coach shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered at the courthouse to welcome the new president, and unlike the presidential pump of Mubarak’s time, the movement was halted only for a short time to miss his car-column on the usually busy road connecting the city center with the southern suburbs.
Although Morsi was ridiculed as an uncharismatic “spare wheel” by the Brotherhood, his personal prestige has risen sharply since his victory and Friday speech, in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only of the Islamists, but also of all those who want to bring to an end the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak.
“Egypt today is a civic, national, constitutional and modern state,” Mursi, dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie, told judges in a wooden paneled courtroom where he took the oath.
Morsi later went to the University of Cairo, where he was to deliver his inaugural speech.
He was given an official reception with the army orchestra, which performed the national anthem, during which he stood on the stand "peacefully".
Field Marshal Hussein Tantavi was present.
His arrival was greeted by the slogan "Army and the people - one hand", which chanted hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
Founded in 1908 as a fort of secular education, Cairo University in the 1970s became a fort of Islamist student groups.
Mursi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where an uprising erupted that ended Mubarak’s authoritarian rule last year, and vowed to return the president’s powers, which were deprived of his office by a military council that took cases from the overthrown leader.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before the court, and not before the parliament, as is customary, he is doing the will of the military, and this is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursi’s speech at Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures.
The next meeting of the Association of Mechanical Engineers of the Tyumen region was held on the basis of the Yalutorov Automobile Plant.
As part of the event, a new line for the production of electric welded steel pipes was presented.
According to the commercial director of the enterprise Denis Gribanov, in 2011 with the appearance of a new owner, a marketing study was conducted to study the market of sales of steel structures in the Tyumen region.
It turned out that the region consumes more than 50,000 tons of electric welded pipes per month.
After that, it was decided to change the profile of the plant and install equipment for their production.
This year, more than 7,000 tons of manufactured products have been shipped.
Investments in the plant amounted to more than 120 million rubles, - said Denis Gribanov.
In October, a new plant was launched, which allows to increase the assortment.
The plant produces both a small profile of the pipe, which is used for the private sector, small forms of construction and in the furniture industry, and a large one - for the construction industry.
We plan to reach the production level of 50,000 tons of products per year, which will make up about 10 percent of its consumption in the Tyumen region.
Despite the transition to other activities, the number of employees at the enterprise has not decreased - now it is 157 people, in plans when buying new equipment - an increase in staff by more than 50 employees.
The company is undergoing retraining of personnel, and the necessary specialists are selected from existing ones.
In the coming year, it is planned to introduce a new unit of longitudinal cutting steel thickness up to five millimeters, which will reduce the cost of production, as well as another plant, with the production speed of the pipe up to 47 meters per minute.
By the end of 2014, the company is going to master the production of pipes, which are used in the housing and communal economy.
The management of the company sets the task of closing up to 70 percent of the needs of the Tyumen region in this product.
Deputy Director of the Investment Policy Department Leonid Ostroumov, addressing the heads of production, advised to pay more attention to the modernization of machine-building enterprises.
This is also addressed by forms of state support to industry, which include reimbursement of interest rates on loans for the purchase of new equipment and the cost of leasing it.
This year it is planned to allocate 150 million rubles for these purposes, two-thirds of this amount has already been spent.
The last commission, which will consider subsidy agreements, accepts documents from enterprises until November 15.
In addition, the budget reimburses the costs of participation of local producers in international fairs.
For the next year, the budget provides funds in the amount of 150 million rubles, which can be used to compensate for leasing payments and loans for the purchase of new equipment.
5 million will be allocated for participation in fairs, 3 million - for energy saving programs.
Reduced to 72 million rubles of funds for the reimbursement of ordered and paid equipment, which is produced in the south of the Tyumen region for the oil and gas complex.
According to Leonid Ostroumov, in the future, this form of support will stop, as the reason for its introduction was the compensation of the mineral extraction tax, which oil companies paid to the regional budget.
At present, they do not do so and subsidies become direct spending obligations of the region.
With this in mind, the regional government considers the direct support of industrial enterprises to be a priority, rather than the financing of the oil industry through them.
Budget assistance will be associated with investment projects that will be implemented in production.
Many business executives have expressed concern about the emerging situation in relations with oil companies.
The subsidy on the equipment purchased by them is a competitive advantage of the industry of the southern Tyumen region, and if it is abolished, it will be difficult to compete at a price with the average Russian band, where the cheaper labor force.
In addition, the question of the continuity of the new owner of TNK-VR - the company "Rosneft", which is not yet placing its orders on the Tyumen enterprises is unclear.
The agreement for the implementation of the Uvat project expires in 2013, and no application for its extension has been received.
Currently, enterprises in the south of the region, which specialize in equipment for the oil and gas sector, cannot form a portfolio of orders for the coming year.
The question remains whether taxes on oil produced in the Uvatsky district will be paid to the region's budget or whether they will be paid at the place of registration of the new owner of the fields.
Tomic will work 240 hours for an extremist video on social networks
The Lenin district court of Tomsk sentenced to 240 hours of mandatory work of a resident of the city, who posted in the social network video of extremist orientation, RIA Novosti reported on Friday a representative of the press service of the regional court.
According to the court, in March 2013, the man posted a video on his page in the popular social network, which was included in the federal list of extremist materials.
In respect of him, a criminal case was initiated under the article of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation "Actions aimed at inciting hatred and enmity, as well as at humiliating the dignity of a person committed in public".
“The Leninsky district court has considered this case in a special order and has found the man guilty of the above-mentioned crime, having imposed a penalty in the form of 240 hours of compulsory work,” the interlocutor of the agency said.
She added that the man had fully admitted his guilt.
Azarov promised the Ukrainians the collapse of the prices of goods after the signing of the association with the European Union
Ukrainian Prime Minister Nikolai Azarov is convinced that prices in the country will fall significantly after the country signs an association agreement with the European Union.
He said this during a conversation with readers of his page on Facebook.
I can definitely say that prices are determined by a large number of factors, including customs payments.
Thus, after the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the provision on the Free Trade Zone, the level of customs duties on imports of goods from the EU will decrease significantly.
This means that prices will have to go down as well.
“This is about goods that come from EU countries,” Azarov wrote.
As for other goods, the effect of the agreement on prices will not be so direct, it will be indirect.
However, there should also be no price increases.
Therefore, the messages on billboards, which have recently appeared quite a lot in our country, that the association with the EU is a price increase, it is not quite so, or, more precisely, it is not at all so.
Investigators check information about child abuse in Bielsko
On October 29, the media published a report that a teacher of one of the kindergartens of the city of Biysk for educational purposes locked the child in the basement.
Investigators are now figuring out all the facts and giving a legal assessment of the activities of kindergarten staff.
After the accusation of bad taste Evgenia Vasilyeva spoke
Yevgeny Vasilyev, to whom almost a year of close media attention has been attached, has never commented on numerous publications in the press, both about the robberies in the Ministry of Defense and about her personally - relations with the former Minister of Defense Anatoly Serdyukov, her poetry and poetry.
However, on November 1, the figurehead of the case of "Defense Service" violated the silence.
In an interview with Life News, Vasilyeva said: “Initially, of course, the task was exactly the same: to extract from me any negative information about the former defense minister.”
There was blackmail for me to testify, or I'm going to jail.
To date, these threats have ceased.
Then we go to court and prove our innocence.
We are 100% sure of the win.
At the same time, it can be concluded from the interview that, perhaps, Vasilyev was most impressed by the words that she does not care about taste.
Probably, it is meant the statement of the official representative of the SK of the Russian Federation Vladimir Markin that in the collection of paintings, which was collected by the protagonist of the case of "Defense Service", there were counterfeits.
Among the arrested property there are a number of paintings that the hostess, being confident in her deep knowledge of art, acquired as masterpieces of world painting.
However, the art expert review, appointed by investigators after the arrest of these paintings, found that they have no artistic value and, simply put, are cheap fakes," Markin said in early October.
Some of the paintings stolen from the Ministry of Defense...
Then they admitted that they were not stolen from the Ministry of Defense, while saying that I was bad at taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss some personal moments?
In my opinion, this is just nonsense,” Vasilyeva says.
Asked if she admits her guilt in at least one of the 12 criminal episodes she is accused of, Vasilyeva said: "Of course, no.
There's nothing to admit.
Moreover, there is no harm to the Russian Federation in question.
They're just misleading people, that's all.
In addition, in response to today's statement by the SC of the Russian Federation that Vasilyeva is avoiding studying the materials of the criminal case, the lawyer of the defendant stated that he and his client "does not allow the investigator to familiarize himself with the materials of the case".
What was the reason for the revelations of Vasilyeva under house arrest, who has not yet communicated with the press?
Maybe how could a woman not respond to the accusation of bad taste?
Or are the journalists of Komsomolka, who claimed a few days ago that she “fallen into an even greater trance under house arrest” because of the news about the reconciliation of Anatoly Serdyukov with his wife and his return to the womb of the family?
The famous military observer of the "KP" Victor Baranets in his article "Serdyukov returned to his wife?" wrote: "The investigators do not rule out that after such a shock, she can become more talkative in interrogations."
Earlier, Vasilyeva took on some accusations of illegal sale of real estate of the Ministry of Defense.
Pre-winter trouble.

From fungicides in the fall it is better to choose copper-containing drugs, for example, 1% Bordeaux mixture or drugs Abiga-Pick, Oxy, Ordan, etc.
Do you think travel agents have gone back in time because of the Internet?
At Flight Centre, there seems to be a reverse trend.
The company has updated its profit forecast for the full year and expects record revenue from vacationers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now expects its primary full-year pre-tax earnings to range from $325 million to $340 million, compared to the previous forecast in the range of $305 million to $315 million.
If the current benchmarks are reached, it will represent a 12-17 percent increase from a record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/2012.
Managing Director Graham Turner said Flight Centre received 8 percent of profits in the first half and started the second half with good performance, especially on weekday trips to Australia and the UK.
“For the period since the beginning of the year, we have been working with profits in our 10 countries, and some of them for the full year are expected to record high profits before deduction of interest and tax contributions,” he said.
“This includes Australia and the UK, which usually bring us the biggest profits.”
In Australia, leisure business recovered in the second half of the year, offsetting a somewhat weaker domestic corporate travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre’s leisure business went well, while corporate customers spent less.
Its U.S. business offset losses incurred during the seasonally weak first half, and is expected to make a profit for the third full year in a row.
Yesterday, Flight Centre shares rose 3 cents to $38.20.
On October 31, Barnaul police identified two gambling halls.
The first worked in the Industrial District on Vzletna Street.
There was a game at the time of the inspection.
There were 24 cars in the club.
Another gambling club was found in the Leninsky district on the street of Anton Petrov.
There were 20 slot machines used.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia on Barnaul reports that administrative materials on the article "Illegal organization and conduct of gambling" have been compiled.
They've taken the technique.
In the near future, the materials on these facts will be sent to the courts of the Industrial and Lenin districts of the city.
In Yekaterinburg, the criminal killed two sisters and burned their bodies.
In Yekaterinburg, the police are searching for a criminal who brutally abused two sisters.
Their bodies were burned after they were killed.
As reported to the "New Region" in the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation in the Sverdlovsk region, the bodies of two women were found in the morning in the Kirovsk region of the Ural capital after a fire was extinguished in a three-room apartment located in a residential house on Uralskaya Street.
The identities of the victims were soon identified.
It turned out that they were sisters, one of them is a resident of Yekaterinburg for 44 years, the other is a 33-year-old resident of the Orenburg region.
The apartment was burned down a few days ago.
His investigation took under personal control the chief policeman of the region Mikhail Borodin.
Internal authorities are working out different versions of the murder, checking the alibis of previously convicted citizens and persons prone to such acts.
In addition, it is established for what purpose the women rented the apartment, and where they lived before, what they did, who they maintained relations with.
Schools called for more attention to mathematics, spelling and grammar
School courses in English literature will require students to study at least one play of Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and modern British art literature since 1914.
The exam will also feature “out-of-the-box texts” to encourage more extensive reading.
The combined course in English Literature and Language will be cancelled.
Beginning in 2015, students will be required to take a separate language graduation exam, with persistent recommendations for choosing English literature as a separate exam.
The Department of Education is due to release new curricula in English and Mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects subject to radical revision.
It will make changes to other major items next year.
The separate regulatory body in the field of OFQUAL exams will present a revised structure of secondary school graduation exams, with a new system of assessments and less coursework.
Speaking in the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said there was “a broad consensus that we need to reform our exam system to restore public confidence,” insisting that school graduation exams would be “more challenging, more ambitious, and more rigorous.”
Studies show that English schools devote less time to mathematics (116 hours per year, or three hours per week for a quarter) than in most countries.
For comparison, Australian schools give an average of 143 hours a year, while in Singapore, students do about 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to devote more time to the math schedule, sources in the coalition said that large-scale school graduation exams in mathematics combined with an increased coefficient in the ranking table would likely serve as an incentive for schools to provide additional training on the subject.
In the curriculum, more attention will be paid to “real-life tasks,” including financial mathematics.
Tickets to Heihe will cost tourists 2,200 rubles
From tomorrow, from Blagoveshchensk to Heihe, tourists will begin to carry ships on an airbag.
For those who want to travel to China, this means additional expenses.
A ticket for a cougar is traditionally much more expensive than a boat.
As reported in the reference service of the company "AmurASSO", the cost of the usual ticket will be 2,200 rubles.
The passage through the hall of increased comfort will cost 2,800 rubles.
By the way, this season the tickets did not travel: at the same price, the cougars drove tourists last spring, and a year ago - in autumn.
Dmitry Medvedev: the growth rate of GDP of the Russian Federation is not enough for the development of the state
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev believes that the growth rate of its GDP is insufficient for Russia and is confident that the situation can be improved by simplifying the conditions of business lending and changing the structure of the Russian economy, focusing on innovation, Reuters reports.
We planned to increase GDP in the region of 3% this year, perhaps even a little more.
Actually, it will be a little less than 2%.
Against the backdrop of a recession in a number of European countries, it would seem not very bad, but for us it is not enough, because the economic base is not as strong as in a number of countries, and in general, in order to develop, there must be higher rates.
Now it is very important that Russian companies, Russian business receive normal loans at a normal price - this is the first thing that must be done," the head of the government stressed.

A trip through the mud, rivers and jungles to provide free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in rural Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend taking in hundreds of patients
There aren’t that many doctors in this West African country — just one in 5,000 people.
Vote here or through your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of CNN’s Top 10 Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other 10 main characters to make him CNN Hero of the Year.
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his outstanding work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle saw his father come back to life and relapse into unconsciousness, wandering through hospitals that were not properly equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he only had a broken arm, but the resulting infection spread to the brain and caused a hematoma that reminded him of himself for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” said Georges Bwelle.
If we had the money, we would have taken him out of Cameroon.
Instead, Bwell had accompanied his father for years in crowded clinics and hospitals, receiving whatever treatment they could get.
“It’s not easy,” Bwell said.
“You can leave the house at 5 a.m., run to the hospital to be the first, but you’re not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people may die because of what they have to wait for.
The situation has not changed much since Bwell’s father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, only one doctor per 5,000 people in Cameroon.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 people.
And even if the Cameroonians could go to the doctor, many of them would not be in their pockets.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of health care spending in this country is private.
“Their only problem is poverty,” Bwell said.
And because of poverty, they can’t enjoy their lives.”
Seeing the suffering of his father and many of his compatriots, Bwell was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. Georges Bwell and his team of volunteers conducted 700 free surgeries.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at Yaounde Central Hospital.
He also founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, which organizes trips to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have assisted nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 other people pack in vans, tie medical supplies to roofs, and drive across the intersecting area to visit the village in need of help.
They are not always lucky.
Many times they had to push cars across rivers and dirt.
But when they come, they are greeted as true heroes: it is a holiday with songs and dances and the best rooms that the locals can offer.
Free medical care in these villages is indeed an occasion for celebration, and Bwelle with his broad smile and boundless energy is more than happy to join the fun.
The next morning, the brigade begins to receive hundreds of patients.
“We take 500 people on each trip,” Bwell said.
They come from all over the county within a radius of 60 kilometers from the village, and they come on foot.
Each of these clinics on weekends provides a variety of medical services.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may get ribs, donated glasses, or free birth certificates—documents needed for school that many poor families simply can’t afford.
In the evenings, the brigade performs simple operations under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually carried out in a school building, municipality or home; after the procedure, patients get up and go to the postoperative zone to make room for the next person.
Using the generator to illuminate the operational and sanitary treatment of the equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work until early Sunday morning.
It’s an unbearable pace, but the brigade’s determination usually helps to support village musicians.
“They’ve been drumming all night so we can stay awake and keep working,” Bwell said.
On Sunday, members of the brigade return to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group, consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, has conducted 700 free surgeries over the past year, and they know that their help can be of great importance to those they help.
One person explained that the free surgery he received to treat the hernia would allow him to work again.
“It will change the future for me and my family,” the man said.
In addition to these clinical treatments on the weekends and working in the hospital, surgeon Bwelle also works at night in private medical clinics around Yaounde.
It is this second work, he said, that provides 60% of the funding for his non-profit organization; the rest is covered by private donations.
"I don't even know when he's sleeping," said Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia, a volunteer in the Bwell group.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to make money for the organization so that these campaigns can continue.
For future doctors and nurses like O’Malley, coming from the US and Europe to join Bwell in fulfilling his tasks, this is an opportunity for practice that they would never get at home.
“We were given the opportunity to assist in operations where we helped remove blood stains or hold instruments for Dr. Bwell,” O’Malley said.
As a second-year student, you would never have had such an opportunity in America.
Volunteer students usually pay for their own travel to Cameroon, often arriving with donated medicines.
But when they arrive in Yaounde, their food, transportation and training are paid by Bwell.
“He’s a hero, no doubt,” O’Malley said.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwell, almost constant workload is not a difficult test.
Helping others to live a happy life, fulfilling their father’s promise, is something that brings him great joy.
“I’m so happy doing this job,” Bwell said.
And I think about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do this to make people laugh to reduce their pain.
Go to the ASCOVIME website and see what you can do to help.
Snowden agrees to testify about Merkel's eavesdropping
Hans-Christian Szczebele, a member of the Bundestag, met with Edward Snowden in Moscow.
During the conversation, the question was discussed whether Snowden could be interrogated as a witness by the German Prosecutor General’s Office in the case of possible wiretapping of the German Chancellor’s phone by US special forces.
Snowden expressed his willingness to give the necessary testimony.
The meeting could take place either in Moscow or in Germany.
"He made it clear," said Hans-Christian Straubele, "that he knows a great deal.
And despite the fact that the National Security Agency led by Keith Alexander blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, first you need to clearly define all the conditions of his arrival. .
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers are beginning to take action in response to a scandal surrounding U.S. spy programs.
The Senate Intelligence Committee approved a bill yesterday introducing additional restrictions on the activities of the U.S. Department of Electronic Intelligence.
Belarus and Turkey are interested in developing and deepening relations in all spheres and areas.
Belarusian Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei told reporters at a press conference following a meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, a Belta correspondent said.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in developing and deepening Belarusian-Turkish relations in all spheres and areas.
Belarus, for its part, is also interested in this, so we have agreed that the public administration bodies of the two countries will provide universal assistance and support to entrepreneurs who establish direct trade and economic contacts with each other," said Vladimir Makei.
He stressed that the Government of Belarus will create all the necessary conditions for this and provide maximum assistance.
The minister also said that the 8th meeting of the Belarusian-Turkish joint intergovernmental economic commission was held in Ankara, following which the protocol was signed.
The parties have developed a road map of Belarusian-Turkish cooperation, which, according to the head of the Belarusian foreign policy department, is aimed at deepening bilateral cooperation in the trade, economic and investment fields, in the fields of industrial cooperation, transport, agriculture, and new forms of energy.
"The minutes of the last meeting have been fully implemented, and I am convinced that the current minutes will also be implemented, because Belarus and Turkey consider each other as reliable partners," he said.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, in turn, said that during the negotiations, the heads of the foreign policy departments of the two countries decided to further develop mutually beneficial cooperation and implement various projects.
The trade between Belarus and Turkey, according to the minister, needs to increase and bring it to an indicator of $1 billion.
Turkey is also an important partner in the area of investment cooperation, which needs to be further developed, as there is untapped potential in this area, he believes.
There has always been a very warm relationship between our countries, and we hope that in the future they will be further strengthened and expanded.
And all the necessary conditions for trade and economic ties and for the successful work of Turkish companies on the territory of Belarus and Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey will be created," Ahmet Davutoglu said.
Obama renounces his words on health care
In the midst of a storm of criticism, President Obama went on a rampage yesterday regarding his often-repeated, unequivocal promise that “if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it.”
Seeing hundreds of thousands of people receiving notices of cessation of service from their providers, Republicans have criticized the president in recent days for misleading American society.
Yesterday, Obama made a few adjustments to his original public promise.
“Most people who have health insurance that works can keep it,” he said in a speech in Boston.
Referring to what he called a "revival in the news" about the cessation of services, Obama urged those receiving these notifications to look for other options in the market.
Most people will be able to get the best, comprehensive health insurance plans at the same price or even cheaper than expected.
“You will get more favorable conditions,” he said.
The administration said it should come as no surprise that 5% of the population who buy insurance on their own may be forced to change plans because their coverage does not meet the new standards required by the Affordable Care Act.
“Let me say directly to these Americans: you deserve better,” Sibelius said in a speech to the House Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sibelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online sales platform has been "horrifyingly bad" since October.
“I’m just as upset and upset as everyone else,” she said.
“I want your trust back.”
Irritated Sibelius rejected the phrase, which was captured by the included microphone sitting behind her assistant at yesterday's hearings in the House after a heated debate with a member of the House of Representatives, Billy Long, a Republican from the state of Missouri, about whether she owes the program to herself.
After more than three hours of hearings, Long once again urged Sibelius to say why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily waived government-sponsored insurance to purchase the plan through HealthCare.gov, which it now imposes on millions of Americans.
Rosbalt Agency deprived of the status of media for indecent fighting
On October 31, the Moscow court decided to invalidate the license for the registration of the Rosbalt agency.
The deprivation of the media agency's status insisted Roskomnadzor - for systematic and gross violations of the law on the media.
During the process, an unpleasant precedent was created: the court considered it possible to close the media, de facto denying the publication the right to present counter-arguments.
What is "Rosbalt"
ZAO "Information Agency Rosbalt" was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In the following years, the agency opened a second head office in Moscow and a number of regional units.
The agency also has representations in the countries of the former USSR.
Since 2001, Rosbalt has developed and functioned as a federal information and analytical agency.
By the mid-2000s, the agency was on the list of the most recognizable private Internet media in Russia.
At the same time, Rosbalt has always occupied a rather specific niche: the core of the agency's exclusive publications were (and still are) notes with reference to sources in law enforcement agencies.
Talks about the publication's proximity to the force structures continued throughout the agency's existence.
In addition to the fact that "Rosbalt" had an extensive base of sources in various departments, in favor of such assumptions said that at the head of the project was Natalia Chaplina - the wife of Viktor Cherkesov.
At the same time, the role of Chaplina in the Rosbalt leadership is not clear to the end: she is most often called the "project manager".
The general director of the agency is Larissa Afonina, the editor-in-chief is Nikolai Ulyanov.
Recently, Rosbalt has not appeared in the ratings of the federal media - neither in terms of citation nor in terms of audience.
In October, the agency took the 25th place in the ranking of visits of Russian media sites according to LiveInternet.
According to the same LiveInternet, the average daily audience of rosbalt.ru site is about 150,000 unique visitors (and up to 500,000 views), monthly - about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials in the last five months are remarks about the helplessness of the Kremlin in relations with Ukraine, the death of the soloist of the group "King and Shot", pogroms in the capital Biryulev.
Rosbalt’s conflict with Roskomnadzor began in July 2013, when an amendment to the media law came into force that banned journalists from engaging in indecent campaigns.
The agency found a banned lexicon in two videos published on the agency's website ("Gigit from Krasnodar" and "Pussy Riot defiled the oil towers").
Further sides are described in different ways.
Roskomnadzor accused Rosbalt of a gross and systematic violation of the law on the media and appealed to the court with a demand to withdraw the license from the agency.
Rosbalt claimed that the claims of the agency were wrong: firstly, the videos were not editorial materials, secondly, the mother words in them were masked, and, thirdly, immediately after the warning, the videos were removed from the site.
Representatives of the agency appealed Roskomnadzor's claims in the court of peace - and when on October 22, 2013, the Moscow court accepted Roskomnadzor's claim, the examination of these complaints was still ongoing.
However, already on the 25th the world judge made a decision not in favor of "Rosbalt": the editor-in-chief Nikolai Ulyanov was found guilty of violating the code on administrative offenses and fined 20 thousand rubles - 10 thousand for each video.
Obviously, this pre-determined the outcome of the hearing in the Moscow court - if you give up the thought that the outcome could have been predicted even earlier.
On October 31, the court decided to invalidate the certificate of registration of Rosbalt, de facto depriving the agency of the status of media.
It cannot be said that "Rosbalt" remained alone during this confrontation.
The agency was supported by deputies of the State Duma (a statement to the head of Roskomnadzor Alexander Zharov on October 10 signed 26 deputies; the document itself was submitted at the initiative of the KPRF).
The head of the Union of Journalists of Russia Vsevolod Bogdanov, the chairman of the Moscow Union of Journalists Pavel Gusev and the head of the Presidential Council on Human Rights Mikhail Fedotov said about the illegality of the closure of the publication.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, the management of Roskomnadzor even provided him with some guarantees that the revocation of the license would not happen.
The Rosbalt court showed: under whose jurisdiction it is safer to be in the media in Russia today - a big question.
Syria Destroys Chemical Weapons Equipment
Syria has destroyed all declared chemical weapons production facilities, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said.
This first phase of disarmament was completed by Damascus a day before the deadline.
By November 1, Syria was supposed to destroy production and other auxiliary facilities intended to prepare combat poisonous substances for use, the BBC reports.
The destruction of the stocks of poisonous substances or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014.
According to a representative of the OPCW, poisonous substances are currently in sealed storage facilities.
International inspectors went to Syria after more than 1,400 people were killed in a chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus on August 21.
The main task of the inspectors was not to waste time - to prevent the Syrian authorities from producing more chemical weapons - and to destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and ammunition equipment.
These production facilities will now be closely monitored to prevent their repairs.
The next milestone is mid-November: by this time, the OPCW and the Syrians must agree on a detailed plan to destroy the already existing stocks of poisonous substances.
There are a lot of questions here.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide the equipment for this?
All Syrian statements will be carefully checked by the Western intelligence services.
They will be willing to advise inspectors of new facilities for inspection if there are grounds to suspect that Damascus is not fully open.
The United States believes that this shelling was carried out by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that this is the work of the Syrian rebels.
The world community demanded from the Syrian leadership, in accordance with the agreement reached through Russia, to destroy or put into disrepair all the capacities for the production of shells, poisoning gases and liquids and for the filling of the shells with these substances.
Now that this stage has been completed, the next step should be the destruction of the already existing chemical weapons in the Syrian army.
The arsenal is believed to contain more than 1,000 tons of nerve agent, mustard gas, and other banned chemicals stored in dozens of different locations.
To destroy it, it is necessary that the OPCW and the Syrian authorities agree on a timetable of action for the first time, which is two weeks.
OPCW Field Operations Chief Jerry Smith told the BBC that his inspectors “were personally watching the destruction of the equipment.”
“They now have no opportunity to continue producing or mixing chemical weapons,” he said.
The OPCW statement said the inspectors visited 21 of the 23 facilities in Syria and made sure that the shell and poisonous substances factories were either destroyed or dismantled.
The remaining two facilities are too dangerous to carry out an inspection there, the document says, but the equipment from there was transported and inspected by OPCW experts.
According to Smith, the process of destroying the chemical weapons infrastructure was “particularly difficult” as work had to be done in the context of the ongoing conflict.
In early October, the OPCW won the Nobel Peace Prize, but Smith said the inspectors had not yet had time to celebrate – they were too busy with their work.
John Kerry says in his unprecedented admission that U.S. espionage “has gone unnecessarily far”
John Kerry has demonstrated a softening of U.S. surveillance program protection tactics by making an unprecedented admission that in some cases U.S. espionage has “gone unnecessarily far.”
The secretary of state also admitted that he was guilty, along with Barack Obama, of being “on autopilot” during the appearance of Edward Snowden’s loud disclosures about NSA spying activities.
These leaks put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Speaking on video at an open government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: “There is no doubt that the president and I, as well as other members of the government, actually perceived some of the things happening on autopilot because such an opportunity had already existed — both during World War II and in the very difficult years of the Cold War.”
He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage went too far, but stressed that no one’s rights were violated.
He said: “In some cases it has gone inappropriately far.
And the president is determined to shed light on this issue and explain himself to the people, and is now conducting a thorough analysis so that no one has a sense of abuse.
I assure you, there is no abuse of innocent people in this process.”
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA had acted in good faith and that his surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We are working in a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up.
There is radical extremism in the world, reckless and determined to kill people, blow up people and attack governments.
And if you were able to intercept it, stop it before it happens?
We actually prevented plane crashes, building explosions and killing people because we were able to learn about these plans in advance.”
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will head to Europe to help resolve issues related to alleged U.S. espionage abroad and convince Europeans to continue joint anti-terrorism efforts with the U.S., the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs chairman said on Thursday.
Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about threats to stop participating in anti-terrorism organizations due to disappointment over the surveillance carried out by the National Security Agency.
“It is really important for U.S. national security interests that Europeans remain our advocates for our common counter-terrorism efforts,” Murphy, who is serving as the first-term Democrat and chair of the Senate’s Subcommittee on International Relations on European Affairs, said in an interview from Washington.
“And I’m going to Europe to let them know that we have to continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger at these NSA programs.”
The news that the NSA had collected millions of records of phone calls in Europe has worsened relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the agency said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of metadata collected by NATO allies and shared with the United States.
Other disclosures cited documents released by Snowden suggesting that the NSA was monitoring German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s mobile phone, as well as the phones of some 34 other world leaders.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper defended espionage activities against the Allies as necessary and said it was a normal affair on both sides.
Against the background of this rumor, Murphy said that his office is organizing a trip of members of Congress, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hopes that the delegation will include members of both parties and both chambers.
The names of other participating legislators should be announced in the coming days.
According to him, the travel program is still in the development stage.
While Murphy said the trip's goal was to help improve the relationship, he said a degree of "hardness from the best motives" would also be displayed.
He said European leaders should be honest with their people in what spyware they themselves have used for years.
“While we can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also agree that we are not the only ones engaged in intelligence activities,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry is due to head to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to address the issues of hostility to the U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as U.S. intelligence activities.
In the new compositions of the public monitoring commissions will increase the influence of prisoners
Today, the Council of the Public Chamber (CPC) can approve new compositions of public supervisory commissions (PCOs) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the option put to the vote is adopted, the lobbyists of the security forces will increase their influence.
The NGOs are public bodies that control the conditions of detention in places of deprivation of liberty.
The cases of Sergei Magnitsky and Leonid Razvozhaev, the riots in the Coptic colony - it is through the ONK that most of the resonant incidents are reported behind bars.
The struggle between human rights defenders and lobbyists of the security forces is under control.
At the meeting of the OP working group on the formation of the OC, I suggested that human rights experience should be used as a selection criterion.
"It was not accepted, and the lists were formed without developing the criteria," says Valeriy Borshchev.
Borshchev is the current chairman of the Moscow Observer Commission and the Association of Independent Observers, an all-Russian body of human rights defenders working on prison issues.
As a member of the State Duma from Apple, he drafted a law regulating the activities of the ONK.
The OP Council is expected to vote on the composition of the ONK in 43 regions of the country.
Fewer than 1,800 vacancies are claimed, and in Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria competitions could not be organized due to the lack of candidates.
OP promises to organize a subset of vacancies.
MOSCOW is one of the few commissions with the competition, despite the fact that in the new composition instead of 20 there will be 40 participants.
According to Borshchev, in the current composition of the metropolitan commission 11 human rights defenders and 9 security forces, and in the variant, which is on the ballot in the OP, the ratio changes by 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights defenders wanted to get into the capital commission.
But the representative of the "Military Brotherhood" Vyacheslav Kalinin can re-enter the new composition.
For three years he was a member of the ONK, but never visited the prisoners.
Borshchev believes that the security forces, having appointed their chairman, will be able to make the work of human rights defenders unbearable, so the human rights defenders do not exclude a collective exit from the commission.
According to them, the promotion of the security forces is coordinated by Anton Tsvetkov, a member of the ONK, who heads the "Officers of Russia" - an organization defending the interests of the security agencies.
"I don't eat babies on the turn track," Anton Tsvetkov told RBC daily.
He denies that he is lobbying the promotion of any lists and says he is not going to prevent human rights defenders from visiting arrested opposition members.
According to Tsvetkov, he was not even interested in what list is currently being voted on in the OP.
He considers the disclosure of Borshchev information a form of pressure.
The possible success of human rights defenders is the planned change of leadership of Chelyabinsk ONK.
Its former leaders will be removed due to last year's Copeland unrest.
The Public Chamber concluded that the leadership of the local commission ignored the problems of the prisoners.
But the Rostov-on-Don NGO can move from human rights defenders to security forces.
From the new lists “missed” the human rights defender-chairman of the local commission, but turned out to be one of its opponents, despite the fact that in May 2013, the Federal Public Chamber excluded him for unethical behavior.
Lists of Moscow and Rostov commissions Borshchev considers "place for Kopeysk".
The revelations of Nadezhda Tolokonnikova did not affect the ONK of Mordovia, which is considered "force": only one human rights defender wanted to get into the new composition, and she did not even accept the documents for the competition.
OP board member Nikolai Svanidze told RBC daily that he voted against the proposed list, as he is outraged by the situation in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don.
He sent his position to other members of the council.
His OP colleague Pavel Gusev says he voted in favour, as he likes the proposed Moscow list.
The drafting of the lists was coordinated by the Deputy Secretary of OP Vladislav Grib, who is also an employee of the FSIN Research Institute.
Mushroom told RBC daily that he does not consider it correct to divide candidates into human rights defenders and security forces and does not agree that the chairmen of the commissions have enough powers to hinder the work of its members.
The mushroom does not begin to predict the results of the vote of the OP Council.
If the proposed list is rejected today, the amended version will be put to the vote in the coming days.
Australian woman appeals against jail term in Thailand <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, sentenced to 15 days in prison on Phuket Island for falsely claiming to have been attacked by a taxi driver, filed an appeal and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by the Phuket Provincial Court of filing a false suit on June 15 following a Thai police report that a local taxi driver carried out the attack on the night of Sunday, June 10, while two other men detained her.
However, video surveillance footage later revealed that she had safely returned to her hotel after a breakup with her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police interrogated Bamford for two days before she admitted to fabricating the story.
Before the trial, she was held in local police cells.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison term in a general-regime detention center on the outskirts of Phuket, rather than a women's adult prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian League player Peter Tanks, who turned to the Foreign Office in Canberra for help for his daughter.
Tanks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about her daughter's well-being and was waiting for her return to Australia.
"Obviously it was an alarming time, but we hope that she will come home safely as soon as possible," Tanks said.
Bamford appealed her sentence and was released on bail at 50,000 baht.
According to reports in Australia, she is currently spending her vacation in the Krabi resort area in southern Thailand.
Thailand's legal sources said Bamford is currently representing a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that the appeal could lead to a court increase her sentence to two years and force her to serve an adult prison term.
However, after the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also seek to restore its undermined tourist image, leading to an acquittal.
Now Roman Senchin is in Paris at the presentation of his novel "Eltysheva", translated into French.
Recall, it was this novel that became the finalist of four awards: "Clear Polyana", "Russian Booker", "National Bestseller" and "Big Book".
And last year the writer for this book was awarded the prize of the Government of the Russian Federation in the field of culture.
Roman Senchin is the undoubted leader in the generation of current thirty-year-old and forty-year-old prose writers.
Practically every publication of his harsh, built on modern life material stories and short stories provokes heated controversy among critics of various directions.
It can be argued that the combined articles on the prose and journalism of Senchin, reviews of his books and magazine publications create a curious and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the late 1990s to the early 2010s.
In the discussions about the works of "one of the most controversial modern writers", according to the critic Sergei Chuprinin, it is mostly about what its participants understand by the word "literature" as they see the present and future not only of our literature, but also of life.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not allow to include most articles and reviews from regional media and blogosphere.
Analytical and review articles are usually given in abbreviation in the "Abstracts..." sections.
