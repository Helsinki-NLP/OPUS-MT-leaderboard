Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
A madhouse where young people are supposed to meet today.
A tomb chapel, where now is excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Small gardeners cultivate the former grounds of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories to the day.
It doesn’t matter if the maps are not up-to-date.
This is known to anyone who has ever had to get excited, because the car navigator indicated a green meadow instead of a bypass road.
The historical maps of the digital Bavaria Atlas, an offer of the state government’s geoportal Bavaria, are anything but up-to-date – but that is precisely why they are very informative.
Especially when you compare them with current online maps.
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the distribution area of the Munich Mercury since the 19th century.
The digital Bavarian Atlas is a patchwork carpet that is not recognized as such.
More detailed maps, so-called map sheets, have been incorporated into the large overview map for cities and municipalities.
These originated according to the Bavarian Survey Administration between 1810 and 1864 and originated from the first survey of Bavaria.
Its client: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria from the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied land and commissioned a topographical survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.
Although the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801: it was the present-day neighbors who created the idea of a comprehensive Bavarian map.
Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph continued the project, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Surveying Administration.
The Urpositionsblatt for Munich dates from 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library, like all others.
The comparison between the former and the present is most impressive in the example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which appears in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated.
Sendling was incorporated 21 years after the creation of the map, i.e. in 1877, as the Munich district.
Today Untersendling is in the middle of the city.
The Untersendlings houses are concentrated around 1856 along the present-day Plinganserstraße, which was only named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the rebellion of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.
Where the West Park is today, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: When zooming in, a smaller map appears with dozens of lines and numbers: hand-numbered passages from the so-called "take-up", from which the property tax was derived.
Small plots no longer occupy farmers - but small gardeners of the plant "Land in Sonne".
A large green area stands out north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810 the scene of the Oktoberfest, was actually still a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the Urpositionsblatt you can read in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen not only the street name "am Gasteig" or from the hill "On the air" - but also in capital letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here on Auerfeldstraße people with delusions were once locked up.
There, in 1858/59, the Munich County Irrenanstalt "Auf der Auer Luften" was created.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - that psychiatrist who is associated with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chaining of so-called fools.
In addition, he has forbidden the personnel to use violence against the occupants," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has been involved in an exhibition of the facility.
At first there was room for 280 patients, later it was expanded to 500 places.
At some point, even this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the circuit center in Haar in 1905.
Since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of the largest psychiatrists in Germany, has been located there.
On the grounds of the former Auer Anstalt, young people now meet in the Munich Salesianum.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training facilities.
To the west is the football field of the TSV Munich East, to the east are residential buildings from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built - in architectural renown to the original construction of the madhouse, which had been destroyed in World War II by bomb attacks.
The Marienplatz was listed as "Main Square" around 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
A decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich.
In December 1944, the Allied bombs tore many holes into the city centre.
A big one remained to this day - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a medieval tomb chapel once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preparatory work and on April 5, 2017 the groundbreaking for the second S-Bahn line took place.
With the slider, the old Munich map can be compared to the aerial view of today - and the hole at the Marienhof can be filled up.
Citizens’ Rights Group Releases Travel Warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning to people of color who travel to Missouri because of the state’s discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is due to enter into force by August 28, 2017, urges African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention to and exercise extreme caution when traveling through the state, as a number of questionable, race-based, and statewide incidents are reported to occur here lately."
A recently passed Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state’s law enforcement agencies disproportionately targeting minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
“They have civil rights violations that happen to people.
They’re being stopped because of their skin color, they’re being beaten up or killed,” Missouri NAACP President Rod Chapel told the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet."
It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.
The group cited incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year after he had no more gasoline during the state trip and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
The council also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General’s Office, which shows that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more likely to be arrested than whites.
“The recommendation is that people be aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People need to be ready, whether it’s bringing bail money or letting relatives know they’re traveling through the state.”
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI’s hate crime reporting program, which ranks the state 16th in terms of the number of such violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a business for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after states passed immigration laws obliging local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration violations, which the ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately, interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Weidezaun project is elementary
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year.
CDU parliamentarians Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have obtained a picture on the spot.
Representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU-Ortsverband met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs at the Schwendemann family’s right-of-way graveyard.
Markus Schwendemann initially provided insights into his farm, where he farmed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, provided 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and housed holiday guests in five apartments.
For him, the "black forest milk" is the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows, according to Schwendemann.
On the table of the holiday guests comes exclusively regional.
As he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he called the grazing fence project "elementarily important".
I can't profitably operate on such steep surfaces.
The lawn area provides a lot of work, a lot of things had to be processed with the motorsense.
"We have to deal with the conditions and the topography here," Schwendemann emphasized.
In 2003, he took over the parent company and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he does not run an organic business.
To Mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear: "The municipality has recognized the importance of the pasture fence project and is pleased with the Leader funding".
At a cost of between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3,000 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4,000 per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.
It is hoped that the reforestation of the areas could be extended for a while.
"The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are thinking about how they can continue to operate," the mayor said.
Farmers are often criticized for their support.
In 2013, a total of 25 parcels of 11 participants were fenced over the pasture fence promotion.
The open holding area is 40 hectares, which must not be reforested until at least 2023.
Half of the total cost of 71,500 euros was funded by Leader, a quarter was borne by the municipality of Fischerbach.
Thus, the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of pasture fence.
"The big advantage is the longevity of the fences," Schwendemann explained.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You do a really good job, without farmers and rural women you can't do it".
Peter Weiß once said, “Here the best food is produced.”
The Landscape Pflegerichtlinie (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state to promote pasture fences.
The goal is to keep the Black Forest open.
A prerequisite is the presence of a conveying stage designated by the LPR.
In addition, the area to be fenced must not be towed (inclination above 35%) and must therefore be threatened by deforestation.
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaun project 2018, the application is currently underway from eight participants with 24 plots, who want to build a fence of almost 16 kilometers.
The open area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112,000 euros.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Now Trump’s White House is taking over the Statue of Liberty
The surest sign of a regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
Americans appreciate these as much as anyone else - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe into a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN about the president’s proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue himself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have lynched him if he had done it.
But he addressed their meaning, and in particular the meaning attributed to it, when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument.
As Miller Acosta retorted, “I don’t want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem to which you refer, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller is actually right, but as he put it himself, it’s not really about history.
It’s about the contemporary response to the chilling words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state not only invites some old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: “Your tired, your poor, / your oppressed masses, longing to breathe freely to the poor, / to the destitute.”
There has never been a time when the “easy waste” was better seen on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism — he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump’s U.S.A.
This conflict over the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is in fact a conflict over the importance of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who were committed to putting their words at the base after her death - knew very well that they were carrying out a highly political act.
The sculpture was to show the connections between French and American republicanism by depicting the feminine embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical pictorial representation.
Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a completely different name: Mother of the Exiles.
The poem’s connection to the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change this back for a long time.
The great cry of Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anyone, but rather is an early neoconservative that brings the American flame into the night-time world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.
It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch should not light the way to the United States."
Quite unusually, Limbaugh came across something here.
The importance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible voyages on the decks of ships.
In the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.
And of course, that’s not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch is not meant to light the way, but to ignite hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team
The United Kingdom’s athletics chief executive Neil Black says the 16-member Scottish contingent in the World Championship squad will “make a massive contribution to the team.”
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, starting on Friday.
Black believes that "something special is being developed in Scotland" and that the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it.
“We welcome it, and we’re trying to understand it, and we’re going to continue it until we find out,” Black said.
“I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they did.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did.
British Athletics: It has something to do with what they did.
And also with the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it’s absolutely brilliant.”
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000-meter track, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team as the team captain.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Their captain’s speech was incredible,” says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, left the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in was great."
The Commonwealth silver medalist, who will compete at her fifth World Championships at the 400m hurdles, says it is “incredible” that 16 Scots are on the British team.
Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championships so far was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The midfielder Muir leads this route and has set five British and two European records in the past year.
It will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m races.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to watch after a great season that included winning the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she is "enormously proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots will not only be part of the team, but in some cases will also be involved in the medals and the finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and elected me makes it very special for me," she added.
"Obviously I'm very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team.
It just shows how far we have come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to get on the podium.
What about my speech as captain?
Yeah, I think she went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, because we have a home world championship.
So it’s really important to rely on this home support and benefit from being back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it’s just going to be such a great atmosphere out there.”
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don’t apply for a public office if you can’t stand the heating up of voters
The father of our country knew something about the bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn’t take long for the newspapers to hit him over everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
He scolded the critics, for sure.
But he did not silence his critics.
For in 1783, Washington said, “Freedom of speech can be taken away—and, stupidly and mutely, we are led to slaughter like sheep.”
That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan’s employees have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for that earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a backlash with "Well, and?".
“It’s just Facebook,” many people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important if it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is amazingly popular.
He has the second-highest approval of the nation's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary heathead.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very adept at using Facebook as his primary means of connecting with his constituents and making his hairless head debut after chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the governor's side - which is a public forum that is officially called and staff paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan’s spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor’s actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it’s too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hated people swinging the whip online.
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are just real people talking to their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, not trolls.
They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not profane.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not filled with hate, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the comment section of The Post.
"I don't appreciate this idea either, if a number of people take a stand on the same issue, then they are more likely to be disregarded by some as a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."
What the governor’s staff called a “concentrated spam attack,” others would probably call “advocacy.”
The Facebook era makes it easy to crop a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past if you had done the same thing, that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials, or to arrest and silence demonstrators.
This is exactly what is happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for insulting Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this issue fell last week in Virginia.
The chairman of Loudoun County’s Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous lettermen suggested his leadership.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all letters to newspapers that downplayed Washington's decisions.
Petitions that criticized his stance on the Amity Treaty, trade and shipping with the UK overwhelmed his office, according to historical documents collected from the George Washington Project’s online papers.
But he did not silence her.
Freedom of speech, diversity of opinion and discourse are the foundations of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort at the Renaissance Club
Former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for domestic comfort in the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, who led to the final at Archerfield Links last year before losing to Paul Eales, is associated with the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
“I’ve seen how the Renaissance club was built, and we’re seeing how it achieves its glory with this event,” Rafferty said.
“The players will see this course from its best side, it is in great condition.
Jerry did a great job setting up this place.
He is an avid supporter of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great window to this course.”
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
“It feels really special,” said the Southport-based player.
“I couldn’t defend the Extremadura Open because it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it.
Getting back to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate.”
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returns to the action on home soil.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
“You want to do well, but you also feel that extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played a solid golf.
I’m happy with how it went so far.”
With the trio on the field, former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty are among the top three.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

Reduced lung cancer death due to passive smoking
Over the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died from passive smoking due to lung cancer.
Scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) came to this result in a study.
“According to our estimates, 167 cases of lung cancer deaths per year are due to passive smoking,” said study leader Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he drew his own study on this topic from 1994.
At that time, there were 400 cases of lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany.
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Home connections turn out to be very complex
The construction work on Villinger Straße is in full swing and "is somewhat in time", according to the head of the construction yard Fred Heinze.
In the area of home connections, the situation is more complicated than suspected, as much is hidden underground, which was not noted in the plans.
Traffic, which repeatedly hampers the construction work, is a major problem for the construction team of the company Stumpp.
"The ignorance of the drivers about red traffic lights and lattices is already enormous," reports Heinze.
The road is closed and only the line buses are allowed to pass through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from the company Stumpp have been busy working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days have been pretty exhausting.
But fortunately, our friend Fritz Matt supplied us with cool mineral water,” says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and Death in Indonesian Goldland
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn’t use a stove.
She rarely even uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai regency in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually puts a sweet potato - locally referred to as "nota" - directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is removed and swallowed with zealous, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work, e.g. washing clothes with cloudy water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a homeless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband’s four wives, no fields were assigned to her.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, late work can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink heavily, and there are soldiers here.
“No one dares to walk around the village after 5pm,” she says.
It is a rare glimpse into the daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was captured in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were supposed to vote through a public hand-raising in front of the occupying troops.
An existing movement that rallied for independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea encompassing the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is desolate. The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour drive by rental car.
There is no public transport.
The city of about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and of corrugated roofs that have been transformed by rust into various yellow-brown tones.
Very few Indonesians have made their trip here, not to mention journalists and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes as well.
“We weren’t used to wearing these clothes,” says Degei, hinting at her lively, hand-woven turban, her dark shirt, and her bright skirt.
"In the past, we only had leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia’s poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia’s gold country.
The world’s largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix’s Freeport McMoran, is just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has timber resources worth an estimated $78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of misery for Papua, which ensures that Indonesia’s powerful military maintains a stifling presence.
A 2005 investigation in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden goats and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua’s tribal highlands in the 1970s became genocide, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year.
“We Will Lose Everything,” says a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which includes reports of previous year’s atrocities, such as unlawful executions and torture—rape and electrocution are particularly popular, according to another report—and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
“It’s difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week,” says Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have strengthened as Papua’s resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of the province's 3.5 million inhabitants is 83% Christian, but demographic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warung canteens sell fried chicken and gado gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting to stay here.
“The migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua,” explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to work in the provincial capital of Jayapura.
"It cost the native Papua - the Mama-Mama [the women] of Papua - their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, pledged to address inequalities and violations of the law in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua's 29 districts - including Paniai - en route to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel cheated.
“Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored,” You says.
In fact, Paniai suffered a low point just two months after Jokowi’s inauguration in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took a spur on her tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had been drinking were hunting and beating the group with their gunpowder, victims and witnesses said.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so hard that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered at a football pitch in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita dance—running in a circle and imitating a bird’s song—of Papua’s Mee Pago tribe.
Some demonstrators began to throw stones at police and military posts.
When the mood warmed up, a command was sent to the soldiers via an internal radio: “If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead,” according to an official document from TIME, which was not released to the local media.
Jeremiah Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto quarter of Enarotali, saw the imminent danger and called for rest and urged the crowd to return home.
No one was listening in the mood.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he said TIME on the porch of his colorfully painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was crowded, many shots were fired," he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," said Yohanes, who like many Indonesians has only one name, the TIME in a gloomy mood.
"I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him."
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers only wanted to “secure” her station because she was being attacked.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua Police spokesman Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
“It’s about life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
The news of the killings only came 'filtered' to Jakarta the following day.
For three weeks, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and vowed to address the historic misfortunes in Papua.
“I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will not happen again in the future,” he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up an extrajudicial mechanism to remedy historical human rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
“Most of the injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have committed to address these violations, but there are processes that need to be gone through,” he said.
Then Wiranto made a withdrawal when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on June 5 and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, “everything is regulated by law,” he said.
Wiranto, accused by the UN of “crimes against humanity,” which claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor’s bloody 1999 independence vote, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims received such claims with ferocious disbelief.
“I’ve been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there’s been no progress at all,” Yohanes says.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
“I’m scared,” he says.
"I'm afraid to be arrested by the military, I'm afraid to be shot."
His brother Yacobus reiterated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after helping bury four of the victims.
“After I buried the bodies, the military was looking for me,” he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in Paniais neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who was drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company’s location office.
Police said the villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd and killed one.
“We were so panicked, we’re afraid there will be revenge,” says 29-year-old Domingogu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were rushed here, according to TIME.
"I hid in my house for two days."
The Deiyai parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and for the mobile police brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a cause of unrest for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development reinforces the dissatisfaction of the tribal Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend Papua's rights by instigating sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in Paniai in recent years under the pretext of "ensuring national sovereignty".
Some never show up again.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty increases dissatisfaction.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is also out of reach.
The people here grow everything they eat: especially nuts and fruit and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women who can work four or five fields of sweet potatoes each.
They keep most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of note cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between native Papua and new migrants, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new air routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better-educated and wealthier migrants.
Papua seldom has the capital or skills needed to run their own businesses competitively.
“Young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here,” says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on reporting remain strained by international media.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basile Longchamp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although they were given the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi’s campaign promises to lift reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development were not realized.
“There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report on Indonesia’s troubled easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa refusal and a blacklist,” he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confined to Papua’s immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "diverse and widespread violations" in Papua including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the group's allegations and told reporters in Jakarta: "In Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there are free media, so it is difficult to conceal the evidence of human rights cases."
The local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence and pressed him "We want freedom", according to a source who also attended the meeting but wants to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papua says it is unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shootings," said Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a robbery military, are in poor educational and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papuas, view their voice for Jokowi as a "debt" that he has to repay.
“They don’t need money, they just want justice,” he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, the families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out one last symbolic act of defiance: the body of a victim was buried on a site right in front of the police and the military station.
They know that justice may never come to them, but at least they don’t let those responsible forget their crimes.
“One member of our family was killed,” Yacobus said with his head down.
“What else can we do?”
Dubai's 'Torch' skyscraper catches fire for second time
A fire broke out in one of the world’s tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 337-metre-high 79-story building.
It is the second fire that sweeps through the high-rise in just two years, which is accidentally called the Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no direct word on the cause of the flame.
“We slept and we got up at the fire alarm and the screaming of the people.
We ran downstairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get downstairs from the 50th floor," a resident who gave his name as George told Reuters.
Dubai’s civil protection authorities said firefighting units extinguished the fire around 4:00 a.m. local time (00:00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said it was working on providing housing for those affected.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rises around the world.
An investigation by the management of the torch building after its fire in 2015 found that most of the damage came from the cladding, the exterior cladding for decoration or insulation.
In the UK, police said they believe the system of insulation and cladding plates at London’s Grenfell Tower in June may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire that killed about 80 people.
No Davis Cup Reform: Next Best-of-five
The president of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) came through with his big Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup singles only on two winning bets was not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
The often very long, but also for this reason highly appreciated five-sentence classics thus remain the traditional competition.
63.54% of the member states voted in favour of the reform, so the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was barely missed.
“We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the entire Davis Cup and Fed Cup reform package.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions,” Haggerty said.
We will continue to work on improving the application process.
It was not until after many objections that the proposal to hold the final in a neutral place was put to the vote.
New from 2018 are only comparatively minor details: For example, the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the right to host the first round in the following year.
To reduce the costs for the organizers, the requirements for training places, etc. will be eased and players will have to complete fewer official media deadlines before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 in 5 U.S. travelers bring banned items to plane, survey finds
A survey of air passengers found that more than 20 percent knowingly or unknowingly smuggled prohibited items past U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 percent who entered the plane while accidentally carrying prohibited knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1 percent said they had discovered late that they had mistakenly traveled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people — conducted by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. — also found that younger travelers were more likely to disregard the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted they knowingly tried to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared to less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items that were intentionally smuggled by TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted to knowingly carrying items with blades through security checks, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they had intentionally brought banned drugs into the plane.
The company said it had surveyed travelers across the country to find out how many had accidentally smuggling through airport security and how many had intentionally done so.
It’s no surprise that the people most likely to carry smuggling goods – knowingly or unknowingly – through safety were the ones most frequently flying.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure what liquids they are allowed to take with them or how much of them.
So it’s no surprise that the largest amount of items seized by the TSA are prohibited liquids.
For a while, people thought the TSA could look at books as smuggling.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn’t care: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order
Elon Musk is happy to announce the number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
In doing so, he has so far underlined that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever-triumphous figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed for the first time another, less glossy figure when announcing the latest quarterly balance sheet: those of the cancellations in the new mass market model 3.
In recent months, Musk had frequently advertised more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery is just beginning.
Now Musk admits: Of the total 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In the event of a cancellation, Tesla will fully refund the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,000 (US$1,000 in the US and <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 in the UK) "reservation deposit".
There are currently 455,000 such non-binding reservations, Musk admitted in a conference call with analysts.
However, the Tesla chief does not believe that the cancellation of around twelve percent of all orders could become a problem so far.
His argument: The challenge with ambitious growth goals lies not in demand, but on the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018, all models are expected to be 500,000, in 2020 one million.
The demand for it is obviously there.
According to Musk, there are currently 1,800 reservations per day.
If you order a "Model 3" today, you can expect delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new, never-before-tested production lines with maximum load without major interruptions.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are major delays, then the non-bindingness of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company can not prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in crowds.
EPA chief Pruitt resigns due to delay in Obama-era rules to reduce emissions
One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, reversed his earlier decision to delay implementation of the Obama-era rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive than previous administrations to the needs of state environmental authorities.
He did not mention the action brought against his previous position in a federal court of appeal.
It is a deadline that expired on October 1 for states to comply with the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering in local decisions or hampering economic growth."
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma prosecutor before his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly switched to blocking or delaying regulations that the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry have opposed.
Wednesday’s abrupt reversal is the latest legal setback for Pruitt’s regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of an Obama administration rule that required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his reversal of ozone standards simply reinforces the EPA’s willingness to cooperate with states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
“Among previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to meet the deadlines for execution and then waited to be indicted by activist groups and others, and to set the deadline for execution in an agreement,” said Pruitt, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
“We don’t believe in regulation through court proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and the authority that we have seriously."
Nevertheless, the EPA’s statement said that Pruitt will eventually use its “delay power and all other legally available powers” to ensure that the rules are “based on sound policy and the best available information.”
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive recast of the ozone rules.
A bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intended to maintain legal pressure.
"The EPA's reversal - according to our lawsuits - is an important health and safety gain for these 6.7 million New Yorkers and those over 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," Schneiderman said.
In this case, New York was joined by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington, and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone is created when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people, and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Representatives of public health and environmentalists cheered on Pruitt’s surprising change of course.
“It’s troubling how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the person in charge of protecting the air we inhale,” said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to fight the Trump administration’s ideological crusade to address environmental polluters and their special interests.”
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 Years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen is invited to a serenade on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 pm.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth Benefiz serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the town have made Tumlingen’s friends and supporters their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It's a unique village toddler".
In 1267, the St. Hilarius Chapel was mentioned for the first time in the Württemberg Documentary Book: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen including the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silber.
According to the text of the document there was on the Tumlinger Berg in addition to the former parish church also a sovereign court, to which the church or the patronage right belonged and not vice versa.
There were also people living there.
As can be seen from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt of 1858, next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the village picture of Tumlingen, the "mountain" was the third, the dominant settlement core of the village.
Old maps from around the year 1600 underpin these historical circumstances.
The right of patronage arose from the right of the early medieval own churches.
A master who built a church, equipped it and occupied it with a priest, remained the owner of this church and was also able to inherit this own church.
This included the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger of the two crushes on Christmas 1673.
The newly purchased bell first rang in 1692, but had to be delivered later in World War II in 1942.
In the Thirty Years' War (1616-1648), the windows were knocked in and the bell ropes were stolen.
The roof was leaking.
In 1796, French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius Cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823, the cemetery was expanded and the Hilarius Church was demolished.
Only the church tower was left standing.
On New Year's Eve in 1834, a storm split the church tower and half of it collapsed.
To prevent an accident, the tower was demolished.
Only the tower dwarf that still exists today has survived as a witness to the 750-year-old history of the church.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the "Schaffigen Rentners" as successors of Dieter Dockhorn maintain the Hilarius plant.
As organizers, the friends and sponsors of Tumlingen invite on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth serenade on the old cemetery to the St. Hilarius Chapel.
It is designed by the combination of the Kepler Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Local leader Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The program starts at 4:30 p.m.
Admission is from 3.30 p.m.
At the end of the serenade, a drink takes place in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows towards the forest," the organizers highlight the fantastic view.
The serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler.
The friends and sponsors of Tumlingen feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini affirms.
Association wants to test approval of wind turbines
"Boisheim defends itself" sees no legal prerequisite for the construction and has therefore turned to the Landrat.
The association "Boisheim defends itself" has requested Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was done illegally.
The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 no wind turbines could have been approved in the Boisheimer Nette, since at that time in Viersen only a wind turbine concentration zone existed at the city border to Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines are in principle possible, but at the same time the concentration zone excludes the use of wind turbines for the rest of the urban area.
Such zones are intended to prevent a "sparging" of the landscape.
Although the city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier due to a change in the land use plan - but the Düsseldorf district government had not approved it due to a form error.
"Due to the lack of planning law requirement, the approval granted is still illegal and therefore withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, chairman of "Boisheim Defends".
Current state of affairs: Before the summer break, the City Council has again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; an approval from the district government is still pending.
Recognizes: "The granting of an authorisation for the construction of wind turbines is therefore excluded by planning law".
The circle confirms the receipt of the invitation.
"The corresponding letters have been received at Kreis Viersen since last week," a spokesman said.
The circle takes them for the occasion to re-examine the matter.
However, they are not expected to stop the process.
In view of ongoing proceedings before the administrative court, the district did not want to comment on the arguments of the association "Boisheim verteidigt sich" on Thursday.
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, plans to build four wind turbines on an area on the Boisheimer Nette.
Already last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, had concluded lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land.
With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity demand of around 11,400 households will be able to be met - which corresponds to about a fifth of the electricity demand of all the four-seater households.
NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersen’s city council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen as well as a stake in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg.
Car and tractor crash: Woman dies in horrific accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning around 10 am on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhine-Lahn district).
A woman was fatally injured.
Two other people were slightly injured.
The highway remained closed for hours.
According to police, a 17-year-old woman from Bornich drove her car with her 53-year-old mother as an escort on the L 333 towards Bogel.
City and retailers plan "Home-Shopping" weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are expected to rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The business association and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to lure residents into shopping in the city center.
As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "home-shopping" weekend is supposed to raise awareness among customers about what offers the city has available outside of the usual supermarket goods.
A market with regional suppliers is therefore planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies should present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops of the city center are supposed to invite you to "midnight shopping".
The action is aimed not only at residents of the city and the nearby region.
In preparation are radio commercials, an internet video and printed bags pointing to the action weekend, according to Christian König.
City administration and business associations cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
With this, the business association and the city are going to another stage of the project "Attractive downtown".
These include new offers such as the first "Active Day" to the fountain festival including sales Sunday, conversations with all traders and hosts to move them to active participation.
Attractive offers on Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on that day are also part of the concept.
In addition, customer potentials should be re-explored or re-explored.
These include spa guests and tourists.
But also many locals would have lost sight of the city center when shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to contribute to revitalizing the city center - up to landlords, the operations of the whole city and clubs.
It was necessary to overcome the lethargy, which was partly widespread with a network, King had said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, Head of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen, announced that five Thuringian cities will participate for the first time on the third "Home-Shopping" day nationwide.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should "advertise the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance for the common good of our cities," Streich said.
The action under the leadership of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that each citizen can influence his or her own direct environment with his or her buying behavior.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at U.S. school
During construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people were injured.
In a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Minneapolis, two people were killed and nine others were injured, some of them seriously.
According to the fire brigade, on Wednesday (local time) another injured person was in critical condition.
One person died when a part of a school building collapsed in the explosion.
A missing person was also later found dead.
The dead were employees of the school.
As a cause of misfortune, the authorities suspected working on a gas pipeline.
During the holiday season, only a few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump puts pressure on Mexico after leaked transcripts of phone calls over payment of border wall
Transcripts of phone calls between U.S. President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump, in a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, called for him to stop publicly saying he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The U.S. president insulted him for publicly insulting the wall and reportedly told him, "You can't tell the press that."
Trump launched his presidential campaign with a promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States, and vowed to have Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade for U.S. refugees migrating to Australia was "ridiculous", "bad" and "stupid", and that the existence of trade mediated by the Obama administration would make him look like a "depp" after he had a ban on resettling refugees in the U.S.
Mr. Trump ended the call after he told Mr. Turnbull, “This is the most unpleasant call for the whole day.”
Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists Relaunch Racist Lynch Attack as Call for Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rushed to the Ford Bridge of Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns stepped out to block his way.
The leader of the mob—a middle-aged man in a needle strip suit—took a long pull on his cigar and gazed scrutinously through the windshield.
Inside, the inmates were horrified.
"We want this n ---- r Roger!" the man roared.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screams tore the silence when a young black man was dragged from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on July 22, is just a remake.
But then when a sling is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost everyone in the audience exuded very real sighs.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to mimic the night when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with the murders.
“It’s really unbelievable that not a single person has been arrested in all these years — even though we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are,” said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the reprise.
“It’s a dirt stain on a story, but it’s a burden on our souls.”
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman from the state of Georgia and a lifelong civil rights activist.
For him, the reprise serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
“We want prosecution, we want cessation, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice,” he said.
“We cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice.”
A forensic doctor puts a bed sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford lynching on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained from NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching process.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although the suspects have remained on the loose for decades, civil rights activists say the double motivation for the lynch actions throughout the city has always been known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision of the Supreme Court allowed black citizens in Georgia for the first time to cast their votes in the election campaign in the summer.
At about the same time as the election, according to the FBI, black farm tenant Roger Malcolm stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight — allegedly over a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in town was that Hester had slept with Malcolm’s wife Dorothy and that the baby she was carrying was not her husband’s.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcolm from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison.
But as they moved away from the prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
“As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders,” an FBI report concludes.
“It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local prosecution that not only was involved in the murders, eliminated evidence, and concealed the identity of witnesses.”
Brooks makes it even more concise.
“It was an election-rights massacre,” he said.
"You were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: 'If you get registered and if you vote, then this will happen to you.'
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual remake of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Their depiction is illustrative, gripping, and grounded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It’s hard to watch, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that’s the point.
“We don’t want to talk about the lynching because then we are confronted with its ugliness in all of us,” she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've been through."
Rehearsals for this year’s production began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors – a dozen whites and the rest blacks – rushed into a room and listened as Greene started a well-played overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene’s co-director.
He has been playing the role of chief clan member for years, but he said the role will never be easier.
“I feel dirty because I’m not like that,” Marbaugh said.
“But I think it’s very important to keep this story alive because we don’t want to go back to those times.”
On the other side of the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, tried their lines.
The play begins with Malcolm, who yells at Hester and oppresses him, angry that he has slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n --- he, get out of my property!"
Rascona responds to the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.
Greene laughed the loudest.
"What?" asked Rascona.
He is alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still shivering.
"I just don't think white people said 'n--he' at the time."
"Yes," joked one of the other black actors.
"You just have to hit the hard 'R.'."
And that is where the energy in the room shifts, a sense of camaraderie replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharply and emphatically.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shots and then silence.
A woman, dressed in a mourning dress, stands over the actor's corpse and performs Billie Holiday's mourning praises "Strange Fruit".
Her voice breaks with every second word.
About a hundred meters behind, a group of about four dozen spectators wipes sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple arrived from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many just come down the street.
They have all experienced Georgia’s drenching moisture for almost eight hours as Brooks takes them on a pilgrimage to the graves of the Malcolms and Dorseys.
Up to this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now that you're standing on the same land where the Lynch murder took place, the air feels spooky.
When the last notes of the song end, Greene invites the crowd to get closer and inspect the bodies.
Children squat on their heads, register the fake blood and the still bodies and whisper to each other.
“They’re not really dead,” a little boy murmurs as if he wants to remember it.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the lynch rope and wipe away their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his co-stars and then breaks down crying in her arms, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks with him.
“It’s okay,” one of the women whispered.
“We know it’s not in your heart.
You did it for a reason.”
Later, the audience gathers with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta are chatting excited about the re-enactment with a black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words that left the performance feeling.
“It’s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and who do that because they look like you,” she said.
“What this really does to me makes me believe that the lynching is still going on,” she added, “today it’s just called police shooting.”
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks keeps his yard at his table, he eats and remembers civil rights.
He said he has already started planning the show next year.
“The posture is in a way inspiring because it describes the horror of what we’ve endured, but it’s also a moment of learning,” he said.
“It’s like, if we don’t learn from it, then it can happen again.
He who does not study his own history, who does not know his own history, is condemned to repeat it.
"God's Twilight" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner’s monumental work, director Frank Castorf relies on a colourful, frivolous staging in front of a gigantic, six-story backdrop.
The stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows a shabby street corner including the remains of a wall and a Dönerbude in Berlin, a "Plaste and Elaste" logo from the GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
In front of it is an open Mercedes Oldtimer, in which the Rhine daughters pose as rocker girls, or alternatively an isetta.
Stacked oil barrels are reminiscent of Castorf's guiding motif - money, power and greed - which draws through his "ring" staging.
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize wonderfully as in the "Rheinggold".
Kess seduces Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), snatches a body into the trunk in a Hollywood manner and gives the Krawallo clique.
Stephen Milling sings the beautifully ugly garden that surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he beats Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Markus Oake) must also believe in it.
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who humble themselves and bends his hands to Merkel-Raute, are celebrated stormily.
There is great applause for the festival orchestra, which is showing up on stage for the first time - in the face of the great heat again in casual casual clothing.
Frank Castorf and his directorial team were eagerly awaited.
If in 2013 he still had to pass a valid pipe concert, five years later there was great jubilation, in which the occasional "buh" shouts fell.
Festival director Katharina Wagner may have been happy about it.
"It is noticeable that the audience has grown together with the "ring" in some way," she had said shortly before the performance of the dpa.
The audience has not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but it has also grown an understanding of his view.
I have a positive summary.
Max Menge works as a volunteer
You work in several places in your volunteer year.
Anywhere?
Quantity: Usually in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
I have also been working at the school all day.
What are your experiences with it?
Crowd: It’s a beautiful, broad spectrum that I see here.
I have to deal with different people, with teenagers, with refugees, with young adults.
You are now 26 years old, so a late volunteer.
How's that coming?
Lots: I graduated.
And then a construction engineering degree, let's say, successfully terminated.
I realized for myself that it’s wrong for me and I want to do something different, work with people.
And then I asked myself, what are you doing?
Make a social year, there is an insight, there you can see how it is real on the spot, in the focal point maybe also.
And was it so?
Lots: I have collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in social sciences in the winter semester.
I will study dual, probably do a social worker training at the Herne Youth Office and study at the University of Applied Sciences in Hamm.
Isn’t it unusual to have several different places of work during volunteering?
Amount: Yes, it is very variable.
It always depends on where you make your FSJ.
It can be done from the home of old age to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.
For me, it was very varied.
I was also partly in the OGS, i.e. in the afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly what irritated me.
I was able to recognize my own strengths and see how it really goes.
Different than in the Civil Engineering degree?
Amount: Well, of course, this is not about calculating statics.
You always have other people in front of you who each have a completely different story behind them.
Whether a refugee or a young person who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually.
Very interesting.
And you weren't afraid of touch?
A: I’m not the guy for that.
It is an area that gives you a lot.
Lots of love, lots of kindness.
There are also times when there are negative moments, but that’s the way life is.
Pearson Cuts Another 3,000 Jobs and Cuts Dividend to Revitalize Business
The British education group Pearson said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividends by 72 percent as another restructuring program is launched to overcome the pressure the company is facing.
The job cut, announced by CEO John Fallon mainly for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, comes in addition to its previous restructuring, which already lost 4,000 jobs.
In May, Pearson announced a <0xC2><0xA3>300 million ($394 million) cost-cutting plan in a third cost-cutting program to revive a business hit by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company, which sold its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said the outlook for the fiscal year was unchanged after seeing an increase of 1 percent to <0xC2><0xA3>2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital of Kabul, killing a NATO soldier and injuring several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a NATO statement said.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in the incident in the Qarabagh district.
The bombing was the last act of violence in Afghanistan this month, killing more than 30 people at a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A NATO statement said the blast took place on Thursday night when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by an "improvised explosive device carried by persons".
The statement states that all the injured are in stable condition and will be treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airport.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO troops in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which about 20% were in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mostly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they carried out this attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the country’s deadliest militant attack since U.S.-led troops ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as U.S. President Donald Trump weighs in to increase the number of U.S. troops supporting the country’s military and police.
Correspondents say that the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses decision to delay smog rule after complaints
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has lifted a decision to delay regulation by the Obama administration, under which states are required to curb smog-causing emissions, a day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
The EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to push forward the so-called “Ozone Regulations 2015” and said it showed the agency’s commitment to working with states.
“We believe in dialogue with and in responding to our state partners,” EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June the EPA’s intention to delay the ozone regulations — in which pollutant emissions are to be measured in a part of the country to determine where cuts need to be made to meet stricter air quality standards — by one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 largely democratic states, along with the District of Columbia, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday, saying the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump’s administration has tried to roll back a wide range of environmental demands imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump says is meant to boost economic growth.
However, the efforts have triggered the backlash of Democrats and conservation groups, who are concerned about the impact of higher emissions on public health.
The EPA’s website says inhaling air that contains ozone “can reduce lung function and intensify respiratory symptoms” such as asthma.
The City Council wants a community space
In the end, the decision was clear: with two votes against, the municipal council of Fluorn-Winzeln decided to establish a community room in the future senior housing facility.
Before the discussion, there is an important information: the purchase contract for the missing piece of land was signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
While it will still take some time for the area that has hitherto belonged to the church to be owned by the community, there is now no planning obstacle for the project to be voted on by a private investor.
For this there is a discussion about a community space.
One of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor, it would provide a living space - around 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with at least 70 square meters of space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council proposes that such a communal space should be provided not only as a meeting place for residents of senior housing, but openly into the municipality.
As an example, the word from the "strickcafé" made the round.
The decision, which was already taken last autumn by the provision of funds for the current budget, is being sweetened by funding opportunities.
The building is in the renovation area.
The establishment of a community space would be, according to Tjaden, with 60 per cent of 30 per cent eligible.
The proposal for a decision, in order to signal to the investor that he does not want to be knocked between the legs in this regard, provides for the conclusion that both saddle - which is based on the surrounding settlement - and canopy - which reduces the height of the tide and makes the construction more economical - would be possible.
Unnecessary, not only does Wilfried Sohmer think, be this addition.
If it helps: unanimously he passes the body.
It is not so easy in the community.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many buildings of her own, with which one does not get very far, for this one now leans at the common room from the window, she says: "I'm having a hard time with it".
Yvonne Staiger is definitely in favour of the community space - but absolutely against municipal participation.
It sees behind it a covert subsidy to anyway wealthy or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, because with the acquisition of the area you do not give a subsidy, but get a real, in case of doubt, marketable counter-value, is the counter-speech.
Staiger's request to split the proposal into three proponents.
With two votes against the original programme, which Stefan Haller sums up as follows: "If we make the decision in this way, we are taking a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure".
Collision with car: cyclist is thrown on the road
A 82-year-old cyclist was caught by a car in Garath on Wednesday and seriously injured.
As the police reported, the 82-year-old Langenfelder had been on his bike on the bike path of the Schwarzer Weg coming from the direction of Hilden at 12.20 pm.
The senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road Am Buchholzer Busch.
A car driver driving in the same direction gave him precedence.
When the Langenfelder was driving on the road, he apparently did not pay attention to the opposite traffic.
He crashed into a car that was driving a 66-year-old Hildener.
The man was thrown into the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital with a rescue vehicle.
FC Bayern Munich have to give up David Alaba and Thiago at the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Super Cup takes place without him: David Alaba has to let the game suck against Dortmund.
With personal care, FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season.
Seven pros are missing the title defender in the Super Cup against the Cup winner.
The personal worries at the German football record champion Bayern Munich are getting bigger before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 pm/ZDF and Eurosport) at the Borussia Dortmund Cup winner.
Coach Carlo Ancelotti must also give up David Alaba in the duel with the BVB.
This was confirmed by the Italians on Friday.
Also missing are Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat.
For the five defeats in the past six Test matches, Ancelotti has blamed the physical condition and the lack of balance in his team’s game.
“We know we’re not in the best physical condition,” Ancelotti said, adding, “The most important point is the team’s balance.
It wasn't good lately."
The 58-year-old, however, believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season.
“Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play intelligently,” said Ancelotti, who expects a “difficult, intense game.”
The duel between the two German heavyweights entices fans.
The game is sold out with 81,360 spectators, the Deutsche Fußball Liga (DFL) announced on Friday.
Hiking in the Harz from Star to Star
In the Harz, the first "star path" is to be created nationwide.
This is planned by the association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star path" meets the information needs of many resin visitors, it was said.
It combines nature, science, movement and athletic performance.
The members want to set up signs along the planned route and inform about stars and constellations.
In a first phase by 2018, the association plans "well-reachable installations in five to six locations" in the Upper Harz.
Inquiries would come to St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber.
The information on the boards should be supplemented via the Internet.
That is why good mobile network reception plays a role in the location selection.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the star path will be extended by train.
"On the star path, viewers learn a lot about the physics of the individual stars," the association said.
They also learned why stars have different colors, or why one star is brighter than another, even though it is much further away.
It will also be communicated in which constellation a selected star is located and when it is best to see it.
The association has been operating the highest observatory in northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg since 2014.
According to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation, the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany.
From there, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda Galaxy are often visible with the naked eye.
Since 2003, at the initiative of the Förderverein Planetarium Göttingen, there is something similar to the planned star cluster - the Planetary Path.
Starting in front of Gebhards Hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary path with its steles leads up to the Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an "alien" location in Diemarden (community like) with the planet Sedna.
The steles with the individual planets - including the dwarf-degraded Pluto at the end point - are arranged exactly at a distance and scale of one to two billion.
The Earth shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the sun standing exactly 75 meters away measures 70 centimeters.
The entire distance of the planetary path is well over four kilometers.
While the light from the sun to Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to reach the stele with Pluto.
Pedestrians are faster than the light in space.
The march to the next fixed star, however, would take another half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, went down the hallway to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super featherweight champion.
After Garcia’s victory by unanimous decision over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Showtime on Saturday, both fighters are members of the top five pound-for-pound list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How are you, Champion?
I wish you good luck."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
As the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect order of magnitude".
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia recalled.
"I went up for Broner [to 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get down to light weight.
And he has to move on lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
This is what the fans demand.
Let's give it to them."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Climate asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree on a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) who also has an interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke am Kampf.
“This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all the fans have been asking for it,” Garcia said, later expressing openly, fighting with the network that offers the best financial package.
We are the best.
No other name can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever you're ready..."
Garcia said he valued Lomachenko as "a huge fighter", and he may be participating in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thinks the three-fighter champion from Riverside looks "very slow, I'm sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-off".
Garcia said the focus was on showing strength, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum built up for their own struggle.
“This is the fight that needs to be fought.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I’m more than happy to be working on it,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It will be a great fight.”
Four injured after tire rigging
In an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon, four people were partly seriously injured.
According to initial information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at around 4.30 p.m. near the market-wide connection point after a tire gap.
The car rushed to the right into the bog, where it overturned and then remained on the roof in the green strip.
The four inmates - two adults and two children - were partly seriously injured in the accident.
During the first supply of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was blocked towards the north for about an hour, after which traffic could be passed on the left lane at the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Three-chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2:2 to the start of the season against Braunschweig that the optimization of the defense formation will bring in Aue points.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first game of the season, with the result also, if there had not been the two opposing goals in the 2:2 against Braunschweig.
"Two goals were too many, and we have to be even more careful in Aue," says the defender from Fortuna Düsseldorf.
In the Ore Mountains, the triple chain is also to be further optimized.
And a goal after a free kick the fortunes no longer want to catch.
"For the future, it will be so that no one stands next to Michael (Rensing) on the line."
Hoffmann is convinced that his team can cope better with the three-way chain than with the four-way chain, even after the experience in preparation.
"I still don't know how we're going to act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his case, "because we just have players in the three-way chain at the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann who can build up well," said Hoffmann.
"It's a prerequisite, but that we harmonize even better and we don't make so many playback errors in the build."
Of course, Hoffmann also drives to Aue to win the game.
"But whether you can talk about a failed start after a tie, I don't know.
The performance could be quite okay," Hoffmann said.
"But if we can stand there with four points on Sunday and focus on the cup, we will certainly be able to talk about a decent start to the season."
His coach didn’t want to know.
"I judge the start of the season only after six to eight days of play," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to talk about an advantage over Aue, only because the game of Saxons in Heidenheim had to be canceled prematurely due to a thunderstorm.
"Now they can start the season almost with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann believes that the players from Aue might even be a little fresher, as they did not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a climbing favorite in the bones.
“But they don’t know 100 percent where they are right now,” the insider for Fortuna said.
Although the guests from the Rhineland as an easy favorite on Sunday go to the meeting in the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue.
"The fact that we are sweeping them away just because we have the claim to be among the first six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose record is quite positive if only one defeat against Aue from nine games.
“There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the start,” explains Fortuna’s head coach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and exaggerated".
And so Funkel does not want to experience his players on Sunday at all.
New results of Swedish asylum age assessment tests published
Recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, who have been subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of those tested are over the age of 18, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority (Rättsmedicinalverket) started conducting the tests last year.
During the asylum procedure, they are supposed to make the assessment of age more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migration Agency) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were underage.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was “possibly 18 years of age or older.”
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person was “possibly under 18 years of age.”
The tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results over the past few months have been consistent.
“We don’t see a big difference in the statistics of the past few months, the numbers are pretty constant,” he told The Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases in which the person has been assessed as over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his or her age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests, saying that there were 442 cases that "suggested that the person examined was 18 years of age or older."
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, it found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which x-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints are made, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.
One skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of humans to see if they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
“I had reason to think about it, and I don’t think the type of measurement should be used.
Assessing biological age in this way is highly uncertain.
If we can’t say it for sure, we shouldn’t act as if we could,” he told the Metro newspaper.
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is low.
The biggest risk is if the person is under 18, in this case this is about 10 percent."
Full in plan
Work on the three bridges of the Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-ton concrete part was installed at the bridge at the eastern town entrance of Lauterbach.
"We are very good in time, it's going great," says Reinhold Leicht, Head of Construction at the Department of Road and Transport at the Government Presidium Freiburg.
In April, work began simultaneously on all three renovation-needed bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The end of construction is scheduled for October and Easy is sure that the schedule will be observed.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the trombach.
It is a arched bridge made of concrete, which is covered with red sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now come into its own.
In order to ensure stability and traffic safety, the three buildings are now being thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are made of red sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the village entrance of Lauterbach has now received on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.30 meters wide and seven tons heavy so-called bridge cap.
This is an edge fastening, which is also used as an operating path.
A 2.20-metre-wide bridge cap will be installed on the southern part of the bridge on Friday.
This is where the pedestrian path should follow.
The special thing is that these are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
The laying of wires through the building in Lauterbach has required a special feeling of fingertips.
Because there is also a fiber optic cable, to which many companies are connected.
The residents were informed about the project in advance of the work by hand lists.
In addition, fish and crustaceans had to be fished off first.
For the bridges between the Bauhof building and the collector's shrine in the direction of Schramberg, the traffic is regulated by a traffic light.
For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbacher village entrance, the road in the area of the bridge at the level of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is completely closed.
The total cost of the three bridge renovations is 700 000 euros.
It is financed throughout the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Colourful protest at German potato salad
It is not so common for parties to pull a string, but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to put under a hat.
The parties represented in the Kreistag Vulkaneifel (CDU, SPD, Grüne, FDP, FWG, Left) are part of a broad alliance, which on this day shows peaceful flag, because the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell invites to the "big campaign start" according to the poster.
And well-known names are starting to emerge - such as Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the September 24th Bundestag elections, and the deputy Bundespräsidentin Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are already on site hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD students, but to demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colourful".
Originally the city picnic was planned under the motto "All at one table" on the fountain square, but now takes place in the parking lot below the roundabout - and thus directly in front of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall.
This is a colorful picture that is available here.
And what Christa Karoli, Chairman of the Forums One World and one of the relevant organizers, really enjoys: "It's great how many people have gathered here".
There’s music and plenty of food, including a “German potato salad that the AfD could easily eat,” says the woman who brought him.
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, they show presence especially at the station, which is only a few meters away from the venues.
How did the AfD get to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulkaneifel reported that he had tried for such an event and received the award.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially asked in Daun, but got a cancellation there because there were not enough parking spaces due to the already built Laurentiuskirms.
Now the Rondell, Hompes is happy that "we can have such a nice event here".
Looking at the event on the roundabout, he says: "This is the right of the people, the main thing, it remains peaceful".
At around 8 p.m., a band will provide entertainment on the Rondell square, in the Stadthalle several speakers, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge.
In the hall there are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and the deputy Bundespräsident Beatrix von Storch to deliver their speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officials had a quiet evening.
The AfD event lasts just over an hour, the guests in the forecourt have a longer breath, but also there is a plan to clean up shortly after 9 p.m.
The police can deflect - no special incidents.
Trombone hits trumpet
A rehearsal with the Wolfacher trombone player Frederic Belli will take place in the series of Haslacher monastery concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 pm in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov, he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest", or "Balkan folklore" meets a classic German education with roots in brass music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and hold solo positions in top European orchestras.
Petkov is solo trumpeter at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is soloposaunist at the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire to not only transcend the boundaries of their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
For example, Johann Sebastian Bach sounds to the two as if in a new dress, Daniel Schnyder's "World Music" combines with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" of jazz choir winner Nils Wogram, classical, jazz and free play blend into a fascinating overall work of art.
This core piece of the program was only premiered this spring with huge success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it specifically for the two musicians and more: The Haslacher Klosterkirche with its special acoustics is consciously involved in the concert.
Kristen Stewart Talks About Her Bisexuality
“Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try everything,” says Kristen Stewart openly about her bisexuality.
“Once I bite in grilled cheese, I think, ‘Oh that was cool, what’s next?’”
The Hollywood star’s most famous relationship was with her “Twilight” colleague Robert Pattinson, who eventually broke up bitterly.
Despite all this, the brunette actress assures the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was seriously in love with everyone I dated.
Or do you think I would have played it?"
After her separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I've always lived and believed in dualism.
It has never confused or hindered me.
I just never liked not being taken seriously.”
She suffered particularly from this, according to "Bang Showbiz" but during her school days, when she preferred to dress like a bub: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me a lot.
When I was eleven, the kids told me I would look like a bub.
I felt really attacked, scared and ashamed.
Now I look back and think, ‘Girl, be proud of yourself!’”
Especially to the public, they don’t like to explain their love life: “People expect you to behave in a certain way and that annoys me.
And some may call me ungrateful, but I don’t like having to justify myself in front of the whole public.”
The Governor of West Virginia announces that he will change the party
West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Trump that he would change the party.
“Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have moved away from me,” Justice said.
“Today I will tell you with many prayers and much thought... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor.”
The rally broke out in cheer.
“Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans,” Justice added.
“As a coach, I would say it’s time to play another game.
Mr. Trump promised a big announcement earlier at the West Virginia Rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, according to Forbes, the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and has inherited a coal business from his father.
It is worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday night saying, "Governor Justice's change of party is another blow to a Democratic party that would rather hinder us than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governments and the control of the fewest legislatures in history, the announcement by Governor Justice is only the latest rejection of a party that is top-down without leadership and unable to find a positive, unifying message," RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement.
Coe praises 'honest' Russian apology for doping scandal
World athletics chief Sebastian Coe praised what he described as an obvious apology from Russia for a doping scandal on Thursday, but reiterated that it was not the time for the country to be reinstated in the sport.
Russia’s athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country’s expulsion from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for "all athletes who were stripped of gold and silver medals in competitions".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban, which was imposed in November 2015, after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
“I thought it was a very open response today, a very honest presentation,” IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has realized in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned."
Coe said he was also “pleased” that Russia accepts the criteria for its re-introduction.
“I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the Task Force’s recommendations that this is not the time to reinstate Russia,” Coe said.
“We need to do everything in the next few months to normalize this situation.
The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players at the World Athletics Championships, which start in London on Friday, according to the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF task force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still had to meet some of the criteria for a reset.
Drug tests are still inadequate and banned trainers are still free, he told reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Act of mourning for soldiers killed in Mali
At a mourning party in North Hesse’s Fritzlar, about 1,000 people of the two soldiers who died in a helicopter crash in Mali thought.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures.
Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing about the cause of the crash.
She described the two pilots as "the masters of her field".
"We bow to this supreme sacrifice that they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she said.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Chief of Staff from North Hesse were killed in West Africa's Mali on Wednesday.
Their carcasses were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a Federal Guard to the Fritzlar Cathedral of St. Peter.
At noon, only the family members in the church said goodbye.
After that, the mourning began in the circle of the family, close friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr as well as politicians.
Hessian Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the inspector general of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker were among them.
The mourners laid down roses, the relatives stood arm in arm at the coffins.
In front of the church, Fritzlarers and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas.
Defense Minister von der Leyen described the dead soldiers as "highly decorated" and experienced in the field.
The Chief of Staff was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regiment and was responsible for the operations of the Tiger fighter helicopter in Fritzlar.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belonged, also stated: "If this occupation could not avert the collapse, then no one would have been able to."
Doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show Minister von der Leyen: the deployment is dangerous.
But he is also of high importance “for a country from which we are separated by only two states,” she said.
After the funeral, the caskets were taken out of the cathedral.
When and where they were buried, the Bundeswehr did not provide any information on this.
Prince Henrik doesn’t want a grave next to his wife
The husband of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
This was announced by the Royal House on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple is buried in the Cathedral of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn N<0xC3><0xB8>rgaard already made a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed with her husband’s decision, the statement said.
Where Prince Henrik will be buried remains unclear.
But he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik had never made a fool of himself for not being happy with his title.
After the ascension of his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
In 2016 he retired and also took the title "Princess meal".
Since Henrik did not get the title and function he wanted in Denmark, he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - not even after his death, said Lene Balleby, the chief spokeswoman of the Danish royal family.
Where the 83-year-old’s final resting place will be remains unclear.
However, he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he has worked for for the past 50 years.
The native Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French noble family, had met Margrethe in London in 1965.
He worked in the French Embassy on the Thames.
During his later wife's time, the people's expressions of sympathy were constantly acclaimed, Prince Henrik had a difficult time with the Danes in his nearly 50-year reign.
In an autobiography, Henrik said of his first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was fluctuating, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knit socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises, whom I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of socially critical intellectuals, I could not hope for pardon.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed.
That was two mistakes!”
Prime Minister Weil wants quick re-election
CDU and FDP ahead of possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is in favour of a quick re-election of the state legislature after the loss of the red-green majority, but he does not want to resign.
On Friday, he called for the dissolution of parliament.
Previously, the surprise exit of a Green MP from her Landtag faction in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the parliamentary elections, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition from the CDU and FDP.
The previous Green MP Elke Twesten justified her step with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
“I see my political future in the CDU,” she said in Hannover on Friday.
CDU Group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his group to include them.
Together, the CDU and FDP have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony parliament, the SPD and the Greens have 68 seats.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new state legislature will be elected regularly on January 14 next year.
Thümler said the red-green state government must now decide whether it can continue to rule without a majority in this situation.
Stephan Weil, however, considers it essential that the Landtag decides on its own dissolution as soon as possible.
The CDU is expected to decide on its next move on Tuesday.
The state constitution also provides for the possibility of the state legislature depriving the prime minister of trust and electing a successor.
“Our constitution offers several options.
These possibilities need to be examined legally cleanly,” said Tümler.
"You will discuss all issues in peace if they are legally reasonably examined."
Thümler called Twesten's step "but something strange".
The politician herself emphasized: "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good.”
She called herself a follower of black-green.
The Greens called on the abdicated MPs to return their Landtag mandate.
"We assume, of course, that she will return her mandate to the parliament, which she has received via the green list of countries, with immediate effect," the country's presidents, Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner, said in a statement.
Anja Piel, chairwoman of the Green Group, said: “We regret the decision of Elke Twesten exceptionally.”
You have deliberately decided not to hold a debate in the Group.
"Even against the background that there were no substantive differences, we cannot grasp this step."
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of Green MP Elke Twesten to the CDU as treason.
"The behaviour of the former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only treason to voters, but also treason to red-green," the head of the Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday.
He supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to have the Landtag re-elected quickly.
The exit of Twestens costs Red-Green in Lower Saxony the majority.
The politician "in her wounded vanity and in her frustration puts her personal interests before the good of the country," criticized SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is participating in this dirty game of intrigue and trying to beat political capital out of it."
Lower Saxony’s CDU Group leader Björn Tümler wants to recommend his MPs to include Elke Twesten in the CDU.
The head of the SPD in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of falsifying the result of the 2013 state elections with personal career rethinking.
The CDU was at that time the strongest force before the SPD, but the SPD and the Greens had a very thin majority of one vote in the parliament.
Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from poison eggs, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is talking about contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) speaks and answers in an interview with Redaktionsnetz Deutschland (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp print.
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de, the federal states each submit the latest information on the affected egg loads.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to everything we currently know, a health hazard is virtually excluded.
Is Aldi now taking over the best possible crisis response - all the eggs out of the supply - because the central role of the enlightener is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture?
Food surveillance is the responsibility of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house has started immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since becoming aware of the concern of Germany.
All information and risk assessment are accessible to consumers.
Trade, as well as manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are safe to trade and safe for health.
If the maximum residue content of 0,005 mg/kg is exceeded for eggs, they shall not be placed on the market.
However, uncontaminated eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time, the companies are not to blame.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
According to the current state of knowledge, the production companies do not face any direct guilt.
Rather, they have to expect economic damage due to alleged illegal practices by service companies.
As always, there are too few inspectors in case of emergency.
Is it just lacking in staff or also in the final competence?
After all, it was the official controls that revealed the process.
However, the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out 100 percent.
It is precisely for this reason that consistent clarification of such events and handing over to the public prosecutor's office in cases where criminal offences may be present are crucial.
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the responsible authorities to provide a thorough explanation.
Is Regular Alertism Really Necessary in Food Scandals?
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and transportable foodstuffs.
When an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
Through the patched means, manufacturers, retailers and consumers have fallen into a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, it must be clear: the illegal use of the insecticide Fipronil in the holding of food-producing animals is not acceptable and must be stopped immediately.
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect all competent authorities to clarify the situation quickly and without any gaps.
How Football’s Financial Rules Affect Neymar’s Move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unfettered spending by European football clubs will not disrupt Neymar’s world record transfer from Spain’s Barcelona to France’s Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, because the leading organization that oversees the European game has the power to prohibit teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG has to prove at some point that the transfer of Neymar was funded without major losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars per year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly loosen up the money for Neymar to sign and take him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team’s funding from Qatar’s energy-rich ruling family.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money to acquire players, but must counteract this with legitimate sources of income that allow them to break even points in their football-related business.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had taken on huge debts in their pursuit of success, effectively cheated and risked ruining themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from concentrating on the club’s debts to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used at Chelsea in 2003 – buying a club with potential and then investing heavily to improve the team and build a global brand – should become a tougher affair.
During the current three-year FFP investment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million.
And although Platini has fallen out of favor with the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to work to deter excessive spending.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future," Andrea Traverso, UEFA's head of FFP, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG has paid Neymar’s buy-out clause in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the replacement amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>44.4 million can be disclosed in the financial statements for the next five years.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit PSG, along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the toughest sanctions.
PSG received a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 million (then $82 million), which was later reduced to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014/15 Champions League remain limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outsmart their financial oversight by inflating their revenues through companies affiliated with the owners of a club.
While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG if the value of sponsorship were to exceed standard market rates, UEFA would not consider this to be legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of sponsorship of the PSA was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar could come through payments from the 2022 World Cup Organizing Committee in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have disputed that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors and such a maneuver could be easy for UEFA regulators to figure out.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG on Neymar's transfer, people familiar with the situation said on Thursday.
They spoke with The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG 2015/16, with sales of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>542.4 million, achieved a profit of more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million.
Accounts for the last financial year have yet to be published.
PSG expects Neymar’s arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The club expects sales to increase by at least 30 percent after signing.
The Spanish league was clearly annoyed to see one of the best footballers go, and it tried to prevent Neymar's withdrawal by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.
"It's a clear case of 'financial doping' with the club and the state," La Liga president Javier Tebas told the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga’s reservations against a state that finances a club.
“It’s the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the past 15 years,” Wenger said on Thursday.
“As soon as a country has an association, anything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country."
Swiss is looking for a new Schoggi supplier
In recent years, Chocolat Frey has produced chocolate on board for the Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is coming to a possible end: the airline re-signs the order.
Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed at the request of the news agency sda a corresponding report of the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" on Friday.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be inspected every two to three years and subjected to quality control.
"We are very pleased with the current supplier Chocolate Frey," the spokeswoman said.
Around 17 million small red-and-white 14-gram shoggi boards each year distribute the flight attendants to the passengers before landing.
The Swiss did not want to give any information about the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to "Northwest Switzerland" at 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion francs.
But more important is always the advertising effect: for a shoe manufacturer, it is a prestigious order.
How many applicants there are in the new tender, the Swiss do not want to reveal.
Only Swiss manufacturers are in question.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolate Frey intends to seek a renewal of the contract beyond the spring of 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for comment.
Since 2006, Swiss have been distributing chocolate boards on board their flights.
Before Swiss signed a contract with Migros, Barry Callebaut, in collaboration with Hug, had delivered the chocolate tablets.
The opportunity to place the logo was introduced by Swiss two and a half years ago with the launch of the collaboration with Chocolate Frey.
The airline cooperates with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, First Class customers are pampered with delicacies from the Sprüngli Confectionery, in the Business Class passengers enjoy Schoggi by Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi by Chocolate Frey.
Swiss Schoggi also distributes Chocolate Frey on the short-haul route, both in business and economy class.
Athletics - Discus Olympian Robert Harting reaches World Cup final
The three-time world champion will fight for a medal in the final on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, winner of the 2016 Olympics, had failed in the national World Cup elimination and could only watch the discus competition from the stands.
Also with the first attempt, the Polish title defender Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters wide, qualified for the final fight.
Nostalgia goes into the niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This repetition of the story is simultaneously nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90s grunge era (when the forerunners David Wain and Michael Showalter filmed the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, for Pauls and Poedd's starring Elizabeth.
As a cultural artifact, it is both a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken of by H. Jon Benjamin).
Stiffening themselves to the core of the gag - middle-aged actors playing horny kids who grow up - they still managed to win back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody goes more by the casting can principle, including a riff on the 1990s stalker films such as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle".
At one point, a character browses through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates, and “a number of other things from 1991.”
Many of the central stories are the same.
The lovable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, has not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has not lost his virginity.
And there’s another crazy-evil plot that involves Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Show Age) who is now backed by George H. W. Bush (a successful impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the tours are the best part of the franchise.
It's especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's underlip beard from "Singles", whose former Big Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.
It's the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repeating "Seven Up!" series until it reaches what I take as its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose final scene will show the band how they will visit the film premiere of "Wet American Hot."
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon now recalls another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War from "The Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-West ring fight iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director claims to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles – a hard-hitting Gregor and an idealistic Joseph – are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to watch (police spends time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - ensures a decent game 'Find the Voice'.
But “Comrade Detective” is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama – a killer wearing a Reagan mask gets involved – that it often plays like a single one.
In six long episodes, it draws in, and the comedy is not fast enough or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective", edited to a shorter length, could deliver his agitprop satire better as Gregor and Joseph visit the American Embassy again and again, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men devouring a bunch of hamburgers.
The message to the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a fodder for a situation.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: we even do it with our own younger history and with theirs.
Strike against drug mafia in the country
The police have managed a blow against the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the prosecutor’s office in Konstanz announced on Friday.
Fifteen defendants between the ages of 25 and 77 have been arrested and warrants have already been issued against them.
In addition, the officials secured larger amounts of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
Two people were arrested in simultaneous raids in Italy.
There were German arrest warrants against the two Italian suspects.
The two are therefore likely to be sent to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the operation.
In total, more than 300 police officers were deployed.
The members of the mafia are accused of organized drug crime, serious acts of violence, attempted murder, and robbery and blackmail.
Since the summer of 2016, the public prosecutor’s office has been investigating Konstanz against organized drug trafficking in southern Germany.
There was a heated exchange between the prosecutors in Constance and Palermo and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, the large-scale deployment on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo.
The focus of the investigations was mainly on Italian nationals with close ties to the Italian mafia.
An incident on 27 May in Hüfingen, in which several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning, is also expected to go to the account of the gang.
Wise complains about large gaps in the foreigner register
"Data of citizens who should not appear": According to a report, the register of foreigners in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This leads to partly serious misjudgments in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, Frank-Jürgen Weise, the Federal Government’s Commissioner for Refugee Management, drew attention to large gaps in the Central Register of Foreigners.
Defects in the data recorded there could lead to "partly serious misjudgments" in asylum procedures and deportations, warned way in an analysis available to the "Süddeutsche Zeitung".
According to the register, ten million people with foreign citizenship are registered, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
Accordingly, the data is managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data has not been properly maintained, the data quality in parts has not been good so far.
In individual cases, data from 1921 were found, "of people who are no longer alive, or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register in fact".
“Faulty data entry can significantly slow down return processes,” the report said.
In addition, EU citizens who do not have to leave at all are included in the statistics on people who are obliged to leave.
Such misalignments, however, led to “a distorted debate about the treatment of persons obliged to leave”, according to the analysis.
Meanwhile, the federal government has apparently started sending refugee families with children under 16 back to Italy when they arrived from there.
This comes from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung".
Accordingly, the paper states that the BAMF is carrying out such procedures "again in relation to families with children - with the exception of infants and toddlers - to Italy since 1 June 2017".
Since the end of 2014, this was practically no longer possible, according to the newspaper, citing the difficult situation on the ground.
Under the Dublin Agreement, it is the responsibility of the EU Member State to reach refugees first.
If a migrant continues to travel to another EU country, that country can send him back to the country of entry.
To justify this, the Office now writes: "In the meantime, the reception capacity for families with underage children in Italy has increased significantly".
Italy has given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments to be sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there as part of the Dublin Agreement.
Ulla Jelpke, a spokeswoman for the Left Party in the Bundestag, criticised the decision, saying: "Families with children are threatening to violate human rights reception conditions and endanger the well-being of children because of shortcomings in the Italian asylum system."
2nd best result achieved
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach has already been made available to other people by the blood donation service.
At least from the 12 citizens who were awarded on Friday.
First of all, Jürgen Greule, who shared 50 litres of blood with his now 100 donations.
Traditionally, the community appreciates in the meeting of the municipal council the multiple willingness to donate blood.
"It's brilliant how our body is designed for this and we respect the donors who make their blood available to strangers, even if it's useless," underlined Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single blood donation helps several people," explained Holger Maisenbacher, the head of the German Red Cross (DRK), because the canned food is broken down into its components.
Three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions that will be carried out in the spring in Oberreichenbach.
"This year, with 114 donors, we achieved the second best result," said the DRC's Head of Readiness.
Obviously, the move to the theater a few years ago led to higher numbers of participants.
Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 blood donations each.
Half as many book Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter gave ten times each 500 milliliters of their juice of life.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and weakening inflation have dampened speculation about a rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain “slow” as it maintains interest rates on family income amid mounting pressure.
The Bank’s Monetary Committee (MPC) policymakers voted 6-2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members seeking an increase this month as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6%, warning that pressure on household incomes would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the fall.
But she signaled that in the next few years interest rate increases would be needed to curb Brexit-induced inflation, and she said that credit costs may have to rise more than expected in the financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth economic package issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding to banks from next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide <0xC2><0xA3>15 billion more under this system - with <0xC2><0xA3>115 billion sterling.
Minutes after the interest rate decision, the bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term as pressure on households' real income continues to weigh on consumption."
Regarding interest rates, she reiterated that “a certain tightening of monetary policy” would be necessary to cool inflation and a “slightly larger” scale than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the bank emphasized that increases would be "gradual" and "limited".
The Bank’s downward-adjusted growth forecasts for this and next year are 1.9% and 1.7% compared to the forecasts for May.
It has maintained its growth forecast at 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell after this news against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to $1.31 and fell 0.4% to $1.11.
The decision does not change after the most recent disappointing growth figures have dampened rising expectations of interest rate increases and GDP has risen from 0.2% in the second quarter to 0.3% in the previous three months.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly at the end of the year.
The latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and slight wage increases, as the tightening gets even worse first before it gets better.
She added that monetary policy cannot “prevent” income collapse in the coming years, but she added that wages will “significantly” recover at the end of their three-year forecast.
The economy is also boosted by rising demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will offset some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after interest rates fell to 0.25% last August after the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall.
The bank estimates that it will likely take four years for this to fully reach prices and the economy.
Before the bank’s latest ruling on interest rates, the call for an interest rate hike had risen as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers demanding an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell from 2.9% in June last month to 2.6%, although the bank said this was expected and will pick it up again in the coming months.
The bank said the excess relative to its 2% target was “entirely” attributable to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again as lenders are looking loudly for deals and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those where the existing deals expire and the new mortgages close, and many with free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular.”
NHS (National Health Service) to prescribe controversial HIV drugs to 10,000 people
Patients will be given access to “transformative” HIV prevention treatment from September following a battle in the High Court against funding the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by about 86 percent, is now being delivered by the health service via a first three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people.
He declared himself ready to fund the trial after the appeals court confirmed a Supreme Court ruling last year that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that local authorities should fund it.
The move, announced on Thursday, was hailed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as an “important new intervention,” while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) called it a “decisive moment.”
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register, and more clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced across England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a sequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in those at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in a person’s body to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken every day or as early as two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals, and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
In clinics, suitable participants agreeing to the study are identified, including men, women, transgender and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a GP can also register for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The program will be <0xC2><0xA3>10 million and NHS England signed a contract to deliver the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.
The study aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence on how it is being used, absorbed and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said: “This major new intervention should complement and overhaul the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuous progress in addressing one of humanity’s greatest health challenges.”
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National AIDS Trust), said: “This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when targeted at needy and at-risk people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
Starting in September, people at high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded experiment in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement.”
Ian Green, CEO of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “The priority must now be that the study is conducted quickly across the country and that no one at risk for HIV is left behind.
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been procured, we are on our way to protecting more than 10,000 HIV-infected people."
Sharon Hodgson, shadow health minister, said: “The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt takes us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study be conducted as soon as possible across the country to protect people who are HIV-infected, and that it will help bring us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.”
Living the Big Life: Upstairs and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, shrank from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It’s on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace – and it’s proof of the new design that Joanne didn’t pack and sell her bags.
“Before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room,” says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day.”
Since the first visit, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has been completely overhauled.
Originally a one-bedroom property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and an intermediate floor to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my requirement,” she says.
To this end, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5-foot-high ceilings to create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which one could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the problem.
“The steelworks are quite complicated,” he explains.
“We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without us having to bend over.
It wasn’t just about building a simple platform, it was about laying the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below.”
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms at full height above each other - with a lot of extra drama.
For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space, and light.
A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units provide space for all Joanne's cutlery and glasses.
By perceiving a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when not in use.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A little bit of engineering went in there," explains Erfan from the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.
"It's counterweight, so it slides very easily when you push the door up."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage, Joanne was able to gain an additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
“At the end of the day, you will sell the land – or how your property is valued,” Erfan says.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size."
Here, they have managed to increase the floor area while using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
“The materials are the things that touch you and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home,” Erfan says.
“You don’t fall in love with the electrical outlets in the walls.
These are important, but they don’t play with your heart.”
It shows that an apartment can turn from something standard to something quite amazing through good design and increased square meters.
In fact, like Joanne, you might decide not to leave them.
Brothers Fight Over $500 Million Real Estate Empire
Two brothers find themselves four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty in a dispute over one of Victoria’s largest real estate empires worth over $500 million.
Former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who took him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets should be divided.
Paul had wanted to retire from the family business since 2014, but a sharp debate about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, amassed since the family bought a business on Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There, the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money was invested in real estate, and De Lutis’ portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as shopping malls in the suburbs.
Following an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as the "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul owns about a third.
A court filing says this means Colin owns $316 million worth of property and Paul owns $176 million worth of property.
The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
“The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought were the best objects,” he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - which Colin, as Paul claims, has ruled out.
Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul of managing some possessions incompetently.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
“My Italian heritage dictates that family is the most important priority,” he wrote.
Costs are rising in this case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both sides.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated late 1950s milk bars and delicatessen shops and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used security to buy the Collingwood estate, where Colin opened the family’s first jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my final years of high school when Paul was still a small child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property to their sons.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $10 million on leaving the company and Luke $26 million.
Both Luke and Mark, Paul says, “became bitter about the conditions of their financial separation.”
Colin has been very reluctant, though he was a former AFL board member and according to a 2015 biography of Eddie McGuire the TV star's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin responded by texting to say “I really can’t say much” because the case was in court.
“It is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and drag our family names through the courts,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to meet his brother’s demands.
“Our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end up in our current dispute,” he said, adding that he “still hopes for a solution.”
On Friday, that hope seemed to be over.
“Our case will be resolved by the courts in the near future,” Colin wrote.
Trump’s new chief of staff plans to restrict the president’s media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump — including news media reports — in the hope of keeping the chief on a more even course.
Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:
“When John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior staff on his first working day, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump’s White House that he wanted to fix: bad information falling into the hands of the president.
Kelly told employees that information about him should flow — whether on paper or in briefings — because the president would make better decisions if he received good information.”
Kelly’s diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump’s relationship with television goes back decades – and now that he’s in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
“If candidate Trump was upset about unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from places that were to be persuaded,” former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico’s Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that “the key to keeping Trump’s Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady price of praise.”
-Okay.
But the idea that Trump’s Twitter habit was ever “under control” is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don’t know to others – that Trump’s tweets would have contained even more ignition without their intervention.
We’ll probably never learn anything about the tweets Trump didn’t send.
If his employees have managed to keep him out of trouble several times, then their efforts have been worthwhile.
But no one has consistently been able to prevent Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House made up of competing parties are constantly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump with material that may be promoting their views of the world.
In May, Politico, which is quite concerned with this story, reported on the advisers' preference to provide the president with questionable information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he’s stubbornly figuring out where they came from.
That’s exactly what happened at the end of February when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of “being the source behind a bunch of leaks” in the White House.
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of harassment or that he offered no concrete evidence or that he has made false accusations in the past and revoked them.
Trump read the article and began questioning employees about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary General Rob Porter “attempted to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump is receiving.”
How did it work?
Kelly tries to do the same thing three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence.
These immutable factors make Kelly’s mission very difficult.
Most Wanted Criminals Get Post from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the help of the population is requested and hoped.
This summer, police across Europe are sending (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run.
Since the addresses of the wanted criminals are not naturally known, indications from the population are hoped and requested.
Europol reported on Friday about the action that follows the "EU Most Wanted" advent calendar of the winter.
Experience has shown that many refugees are hiding in holiday destinations, according to Europol.
21 postcards have been compiled for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016, the website www.eumostwanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
36 of the online searches have so far been arrested, at least 11 of them due to indications of publication on the website.
Travelers Negotiate a Trench and Return to the 'Millionaires Series'
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands are back at war with some determined travelers who have negotiated a moat pulled by the community to reclaim a field in front of their mansions.
Travelers have parked their 20 caravans in a field off a wealthy Solihull road called the “Millionaires Series.”
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were only thrown out in May, but were not deterred by a trench dug by the council to prevent their incursions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defenses and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unobstructed to find a way.
Angry residents have pressed Solihull's council, which said it was "useless to deal with the problem".
An anonymous resident said: “They moved there on Monday night after being forwarded by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at the passersby.
The Council must be forced into action by shame for its implementation, as it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, were moved on and are now back.
More arrived last night, probably more today.”
She added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by holding long instructions to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I’m not happy to continue paying my community tax if the council can’t even stop it.”
One resident who didn’t want to be named said, “It’s ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travelers just to be looted by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the parking area."
A Solihull Council spokeswoman said: “We are aware of an unauthorized camp in the countryside beyond Streetsbrook Road and are working with the Solihull Police and we are taking the necessary legal steps to ensure that they move on as quickly as possible.
To support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create an image of the situation in which the court has to examine when we bring our case."
From Birkenhof to Waldhotel Luise
The former Hotel Birkenhof becomes the Waldhotel Luise.
The house at the gates of Freudenstädt is currently being renovated and is due to reopen on 1 March next year.
This is good news for the city.
Because with the closure of the hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on April 13, 2014, around 30,000 nights per year were lost, as well as revenues from the tourist tax.
In the autumn of 2014, in view of the dramatic increase in the number of refugees arriving in the district, the hotel building was offered to the county council office as a collective accommodation, which caused controversial discussions.
The city prevented asylum seekers from being accommodated by drawing up a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not undisputed in the city council at the time.
But above all, the Mayor of Freudenstadt, Julian Osswald, defended the location of the hotel and already spoke of serious interested parties at the house.
He should keep right.
The Luisenhotels Group with Managing Director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a three-star-plus-category house under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof, construction containers have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovation work is being carried out.
The floors were torn out, ceilings partially demolished, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There is still a lot to do until March.
“It’s actually a nice hotel,” says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.
Everything should later become "nicely close to the citizen", as Thomas Scherer puts it.
"We want to make a piece of jewelry out of it."
A swimming pool, a spa area and a meeting room are offered for the use of guests.
One does not want to position oneself at the high level of hotels in Lauterbad, but already at an elevated downtown level, emphasizes Scherer.
The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to be set up wide, Scherer explains further.
Both individual vacationers, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel.
He has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause, according to Scherer.
The ideas of the city are similar to those of the hotel group.
“We are on the same line.”
Asked about the level of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to specify himself exactly.
Just under a million dollars, he reckons.
The outdoor facilities are also being brought to the forefront, which is already clearly visible.
In a courtyard, a large terrace is created, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market".
Russia: U.S. Special Investigator Uses Grand Jury
In the Russia affair with U.S. President Donald Trump, Special Investigator Robert Mueller is said to have set up a so-called Grand Jury.
The panel has taken up work in recent weeks, the Wall Street Journal wrote, citing people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper saw the move as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigations.
CNN reported that there were already first invitations by the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump’s eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
U.S. intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of meddling in the 2016 presidential election campaign.
Mueller is investigating whether there was an agreement between Trump’s campaign team and Moscow.
The focus of the investigations should be several men who acted as advisers to the Republican in the election campaign.
According to reports, Mueller also took more and more of Trump’s private and business environment under scrutiny.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that Special Investigator Trump had personally moved to the center and was investigating the allegation that the president may have obstructed justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine the evidence available in possible criminal cases and decide whether to file an indictment.
Grand Jurys are also known as Prosecution Chambers.
They are usually switched on when it comes to larger and controversial cases.
The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.
The panel can also be contacted by the Public Prosecutor’s Office to invite persons to be interrogated under oath.
According to CNN, subpoenas have already been issued about the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
Persons involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement, the report said.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump’s adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his then campaign chief Paul Manafort were also present at the conversation.
Law experts said on U.S. television Thursday night that the injunction shows Mueller not to be intimidated in his work and that he wants to act quickly if necessary.
But it doesn’t necessarily mean that the grand jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the indictment.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the panel is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump.
Amid the new revelations, the president on Thursday night used a speech in West Virginia to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
“Russian history is a total invention,” Trump said.
The issue gives Democrats a chance to “feel good because they have nothing else to talk about.”
His special counsel, Ty Cobb, said in a statement that he knew nothing about the establishment of a grand jury.
But they also usually work in secret, he emphasized.
The White House endorsed any measures that accelerated the work of the Special Investigator in a "fair" way.
Former FBI chief James Comey has said three times that he will not investigate the president.
There is no reason to believe that anything has changed, the statement said.
Mueller was only used after Trump fired Comey.
Because of this outcry, accusations against Trump had become loud that he wanted to obstruct the judiciary.
Comey told a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to stop the investigation into then-national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation.
According to U.S. media reports, the White House was collecting material against the Special Investigator and his staff.
This sparked speculation about whether Trump wanted to fire Mueller.
Unlike an independent congressional special investigator, such as in the Watergate affair surrounding later-retired President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the insistence of the President by the Justice Department.
But several senators from both parties want to prevent such a move.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators introduced bills on Thursday that would make it impossible for the Special Investigator to be fired.
Antarctica: Giant iceberg drifts in Antarctica
In the West Antarctica, a giant iceberg of the almost seven times the size of Berlin has dissolved from the Shelf.
This was announced by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven on Wednesday.
The colossus, which weighs over a trillion tons and is 5,800 square kilometers, is now drifting north and will probably take two or three years to melt.
It is one of the largest ice giants recorded by researchers over the past three decades, with a length of 175 kilometers and a width of up to 50 kilometers.
There is no danger to humans from him.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in breaking down the iceberg is unclear, according to researchers.
Overall, however, there has been a series of unusual ice shelf collapses in the region for about 30 years, the U.S. Snow and Ice Research Center (NSIDC) writes in a factual background.
According to many researchers, this may have something to do with global warming.
The now demolished colossus was previously part of the Larsen-C shelf.
Shelf ice swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It thus continues to grow further into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen-C shelf is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.
To the north of this shelf, the balance of growth and disruption had been disturbed a few years ago.
A complete shale melted there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is a lot of evidence that the Larsen C-shell is also in danger, because the front edge has never retreated as far as it is now.
In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can disintegrate if a piece breaks off at a key point.
Melting ice and icebergs does not increase sea level, as they swim on the water and displace ice as much water as it produces after melting itself.
However, the loss of the shelf leads to the glaciers flowing directly into the sea and being able to drain much faster than before.
This could potentially raise sea levels, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas).
According to AWI, the Larsen-C shelf is the fourth largest shelf in Antarctica at almost 50,000 square kilometers.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.
There it breaks down regularly.
"Although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice sheet is now in a more vulnerable position," said Martin O'Leary of Swansea University.
"This is the largest withdrawal since the beginning of the recordings," he said.
Among scientists, it is disputed whether the Larsen-C shelf will now grow again or go back in the long term and possibly coincide, said his colleague Adrian Luckman, adding, "Our models say it will be less stable."
But this development will take decades.
Although these researchers do not attribute the demolition of this giant iceberg to climate change, many ice sheets of the Antarctic Peninsula have decayed in recent decades.
This long tip of Antarctica extends towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the Antarctic Peninsula’s ice sheet has declined by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The temperature rise has contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by about three degrees over the past 50 years, making it one of the areas where temperatures are rising the fastest.
CDU wants house tariff on staff
As it becomes more and more difficult to fill vacancies, the CDU is demanding to leave the employers’ association in order to become more attractive.
Just before the summer break, the Kreistag has gained 41 new positions in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now 17 trainees have their first day of work behind them.
The teaching positions in the circle are obviously very desirable.
Around 620 applications were to be registered for the places to be awarded this year.
Nevertheless, the circle still lacks personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks.
Currently, there are still 50 unfilled positions in Mettmann County.
Doctors and engineers as well as forces of the general administration are sought, among others.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG in the Kreistag and counter the shortage of specialists in the administration.
According to the parties, the administration is to "develop a concept for the recruitment and development of personnel".
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for skilled workers, but to counteract the shortage of applicants in a future-oriented way, it says.
The overall concept should be internally and externally oriented, show concrete measures for cross-entrants and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you did not know before.
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
We are talking about a real "competition of public employers".
In addition, a large number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age.
This is the best time to act so that there are no more vacancies.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, the CDU’s leader, goes beyond the joint motion with his party.
He recently made a big surprise in the roundabout, when he publicly questioned the cover for personnel costs and stunned the other parties.
Peoples want to see all the possibilities that allow for a withdrawal from the municipal employers' association.
"If we do not come to a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the district administration should seek a house tariff with the unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the cities belonging to the district," said Völker.
In doing so, the CDU is trying to pay employees and civil servants better than is actually provided for in the Tariff Code for Public Service.
Wages are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money are only available if you move to a higher level, which is oriented to professional years.
However, the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees took care of the provisions of the new Prostitute Protection Act.
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and District Director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.
Italy tightens tone to NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs operating rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they should not continue to do so unless they adhere to new rules for their operations.
“If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work,” Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German aid organization 'Jugend Rettet' because their crew had effectively worked with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organization, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on the detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, the rescue of human life is and remains our top priority, so we are very sorry that we are currently unable to operate in the search and rescue zone," the organization said in a statement on social media.
"We can only assess all the allegations that are currently being made after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of 'Jugend Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.
It is suspected that its crew is taking hoseboat migrants on board, which are delivered to them directly by human traffickers, and that the smugglers can take off so that the ships can be re-used.
At least one such meeting allegedly took place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor’s file, the contents of which were published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of evading the authority of the Italian Coast Guard to monitor rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reason.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must have an Italian police officer on board who oversees their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to adhere to the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable as they would not bring "substantial changes or obstacles" to their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti said the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the rescue measures had fallen sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and to cooperate with local mayors had borne fruit.
"In the last few days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Climbing and Trials
Neun Weilermer bikers, the "Berliner Außenposten" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz to enjoy four days of trials and sights.
Three friendly guides were available for this.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.
It was followed by viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far beyond the Palatinate forest and the outlying plains.
In the meantime, there were always longer climbs, for which long trials rewarded.
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Again, the viewpoint lined up to the viewpoint, connected by "flowing" trials and moderate increases.
In the last two days, many meters of altitude were again indicated.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and huts brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathed healing sol in the outdoor inhalation room.
Neustadt was also driven.
After 173 kilometers and almost 4,500 meters of altitude, the group had met the Palatine Forest from its best side - sporty and cultural.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga prepares for e-sports
Will the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles in the future, instead of sweating themselves in the wind and weather fighting over the stadium grounds?
The fact is: e-sports has long since become a serious industry, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high stakes included.
This has also been recognised by the first Bundesliga clubs that are becoming increasingly involved in this area.
VfL Wolfsburg started in 2015, FC Schalke 04 followed and lastly VfB Stuttgart, which in mid-July founded an e-sports department and contracted two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.
"We hope that this will inspire entirely new young target groups for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure "that there will be several more clubs on this train".
Next weekend, the FIFA World Football Association in London is organizing the first "Interactive Club World Cup", in which the players of different clubs compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football has to deal with the 14- to 30-year-olds in particular, so that the young people still go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-athletes under contract, you could be present online much more often in these markets than just sending the Bundesliga team to Asia once a year.
What exactly is it?
In e-sports, computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or the football simulation FIFA are contested on a competitive level.
For a long time, as in normal sports, leagues have been established in which the professionals compete against each other.
And at the 2022 Asian Games, E-Sport is already part of the official program.
But is it a real sport at all?
For many, the idea is certainly in need of habituation.
Ingo Froböse has also dealt with the issue for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sports University in Cologne, e-sports is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
In addition, it requires cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding, and a quick responsiveness.
Professional gamers should not only train on the console, but also their body and pay attention to the diet.
"The fit player is a good player."
Froböse also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more an issue".
Controls are difficult to carry out in online games, and in the scene the structures of the classic sport were lacking.
Positively, the scientist highlights the high integrative effect of e-sports.
The players are traveling internationally, which is like a big global family, as there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sports.
In 2016, 50 million euros were invested in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years, sales are expected to reach 130 million.
Compared to the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga, this is not much.
However, e-sports is "not far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," write the Deloitte consultants.
Internationally, many countries are already further away.
Major markets are Asia and the US, where former basketball players Shaquille O’Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in eSports betting provider Unikrn.
There is a lot going on in Europe as well.
In a Norwegian school, e-sports was introduced as a teaching subject, says Froböse.
According to Dutt, in the Netherlands and France, the first-ever football league clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports department.
"In European comparison, Germany is lagging behind," explains VfB board member Röttgermann.
Just to fall into nostalgia and explain the old times is no longer enough today.
It is about preserving the tradition of the association, but at the same time aligning the company with the modern market.
“We live in a digitalized world,” Dutt said.
“You can’t just say that football is the only thing that stays the way it always was.”
Poison egg ade - The egg alternatives for cooking and baking
Almost all federal states have been affected by the poisoned eggs scandal.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have reacted and removed all eggs from the sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs that have been shown to contain no fipronil should be taken into the shelves.
Michelle Carter Sentenced to Suicide by Conrad Roy
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years on probation.
Carter was convicted in June of the negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who died on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday: "My family is inconsolable.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appeal.
She had been faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr. Roy suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a cream-coloured blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and downward-facing eyes when she was sentenced.
"Your actions have killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended her life to make her own better.
She has not taken any responsibility," she said.
"She has shown no regrets".
But Carter’s lawyer said it was a “terrible circumstance that she completely regrets.”
Judge Lawrence Moniz, however, said he had not found out that their "age or maturity or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions."
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy’s mother Lynn Roy, saying that “there is no day when I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try, despite all my pain that we will carry with us for eternity, to be there for his sisters," it says.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said she was being "stalked" by the realization that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt for his children.
“No longer having that one person I’ve been with every day since birth is a pain I’ll always keep with me for the rest of my life,” she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask someone else to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case attracted national attention after Carter’s text messages revealed that they had encouraged him to end his life.
“Hang up, jump off a building, get yourself, I don’t know, there are many ways,” she said in several news reports she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote, “You have to do it, Conrad” and “All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy.”
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention through Roy’s death and ordered that she should benefit from the case through any press.
The case shared the legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of murdering her British roommate in Italy before being acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new mini-lahm of FC Bayern
The fact that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to compete at the Audi Cup as captain is no coincidence.
FC Bayern has entrusted the Confed Cup winner with a great season - extra motivation does not hurt.
Something was different in his place in the cabin, which Joshua Kimmich immediately saw, even though the extra piece of clothing was very, very small.
But since on the second day of the Audi Cup there was of course no Philipp Lahm and also no Manuel Neuer to be seen, he made the tie he was assigned to hold on to his arm.
"The coach has not announced it," the Confed Cup winner later recounted, after his first assignment as Bayern captain.
Good, the challenge could have been better than the 0:2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign from the coach could also interpret Kimmich in this way.
It was not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal who was chosen as the game leader in the C-Elf consisting of youth players, debutants and professionals just coming from the holidays, but he.
Sugar is best distributed to those whom you trust a lot, which you want to keep in the mood.
So those who have been chosen to take up the legacy of lameness can only use a little extra motivation well.
Kimmich confirmed, "That's what you want as a player: to take responsibility."
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old fluttered over the field as a mini-lame.
Right back, that's his position now, the white bandage on her arm did the rest.
And in general, Kimmich acted in this starting formation as the one who can best take the rudder in his hand.
He gave instructions, tried to steer the unrecorded troops.
He had his eyes on the whole, while many others were busy with themselves.
Vidal to overplay his lack of fitness (nearly folded); Renato Sanches to get out on devil to connect to the performances of the Asia trip (only folded only conditionally); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle not to stand out negatively in their first appearance in the Bayern shirt.
After all, it worked out very well.
Süle ran alongside Kimmich, Rudy up before the defense, both acting sovereign.
The famously occupied Napoli storm was often difficult, in addition, Süle also tried himself successfully in the construction of the game a few times.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result "was not as we had hoped".
But he also showed a decent performance at the debut.
Game shift, tempo change: "For this style I was also brought".
How unfamiliar this Bavarian world is for the newcomers, we saw in the aftermath of the match.
For example, Rudy did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but definitely six or seven.
Kimmich said goodbye after a few crisp statements in the back of his new teammates.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "What is going on here, I have already noticed.
With Bayern, you just have to win every game.”
After all, he doesn’t have to teach that to the new.
Alaba motivates <0xC3><0x96>FB ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our <0xC3><0x96>FB ladies
Austria's most famous footballer has reported on Twitter just before the game and wished the <0xC3><0x96>FB-Damen all the best.
The Bayern-Legionär is practically a club colleague of <0xC3><0x96>FB-Kapitänin Schnaderbeck and fiebert with our ladies.
The tweet of the Austrian Footballer of the Year and Champions League winner should be a special motivational shot.
Our ladies might also need the famous Bavarian duel.
Business Satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister: Economy Praises Wissings Tempo
It often became irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economy of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak at T V's request of a change in economic policy - and at the same time reproach the old minister.
Frank Natus, chairman of the Association of Trier Companies (VTU), says: "Wissing is responding to the wishes of the economy, which has blocked Lemke all".
Natus sees the biggest turning point in infrastructure policy: the gap on Highway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country’s priority list.
This year, the Ministry hopes for a planning procedure, until 2021 the construction law should stand.
A role in the plans of the country is also played by the western bypass of Trier, which is in the pressing need of the Federal Roadmap.
The goal is to start operating the route in December 2020, says Ministry Spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees this as a way to support regional but internationally competitive companies.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) Trier, as prompted by Wissing, aims to create a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports, which has been declining for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, the IHK praises.
The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees in the new Master Bonus an additional incentive for young trainees, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of 1000 euros is provided for the existing master's examination and 2500 euros if graduates become self-employed within ten years of master's training.
But the homework list for the country remains long.
In the planned road construction, facts are to be quickly created, at the same time the country lacks the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, Chief Executive Officer of IHK Trier.
Of the 56 new engineers who want to hire Wissing for mobility at the state-run company, only 29 are currently employed.
The IHK is calling for more contracts to be awarded to external offices.
CDU faction vice-president Christian Baldauf refers to calculations of the Court of Auditors that the country invests more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of state roads in 2017 and 2018 than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country how it wants to fix the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
Sobering is also the previous broadband expansion in the country.
In 2016, regional companies rated grid supply in an IHK survey only with a rating of 3.4.
They complain about stagnant internet connections and interruptions.
In contrast, former Economy Minister Eveline Lemke is currently out of politics and is still on the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Greens left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where she had already cleared the field after four months due to disagreements.
Audi to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a backlash
A day before Audi’s announcement, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believed that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions", referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the undertakings as recalls.
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with CO2 emissions rules.
But the nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel engines are considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
The cost to automakers to install systems to neutralize the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of harassing the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which used so-called switch-off devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen employees have been indicted, while others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at Audi’s engine development in Germany was arrested.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to justice in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was implicated in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was expanded.
The involvement of Audi in the investigation could seriously burden Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to the profit of Volkswagen.
This message has the fleet on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order for the Isar visitors to join us, a fleet will sail through Munich on Saturday morning, which has a special message.
If it moves to the Isar again on Saturday, you will see a large raft there between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And this is not a typical fleet, with Isar tourists.
But the construction department wants to clarify.
On the raft you can see a large info transparent.
It shows a trash can.
The launch of a publicity campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "True love is ..." the understanding of the Isar as a protected wild river should be sharpened.
Already last summer the fleet crossed the Isar and again this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a considerate and environmentally conscious behavior.
Mordillo's lumpy noses and laughing at the suffering
Mordillo was at times one of the most published cartoon cartoonists, the tubers of his characters being his trademark.
Even at 85, the Argentine still draws and works on a film.
His message: Laugh, "because there is too much suffering in the world."
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932, the son of a Spanish immigrant in Buenos Aires.
In his first years as an artist, he worked as a illustrator for greeting cards, which frustrated him.
“The happiest day in my professional life was the day I lost my job,” he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he achieved a breakthrough at the end of the 60s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in "Star" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Again and again, the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, round Mordillo figures swirl in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, according to his own information, he still sits at the drawing table today, working almost ten hours a day.
Through calendars, puzzles, books for big and small, t-shirts, plush animals and watches, his funny characters continue to find a lot of spread around the world.
For six years he has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters.
The main character in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thousand footer as an opponent.
For the first time, his characters speak in the 3D film, which is to come to the cinema screen in 2019.
“I don’t know exactly what they’re going to say, it’s weird for me,” Mordillo says.
The script is not written by him.
That is why he is more likely to rely on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced wordlessly.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender is declining due to drought-like conditions and insects transmitting diseases, causing severe headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: “The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the fall.
This has an impact on the lifespan of lavender.
There is also a small cicadas, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are very many of them."
And there's a lot at stake.
Lavender oil not only appeals to vacationers, it is also in high demand for perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “Rather than having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil.”
The solutions that are considered include better water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, as well as spraying the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and developing varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhone is celebrating its 1200th anniversary this year.
The highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Grocers, tenants, merchants, vagants or a country slave camp should be experienced in the city center on these days.
The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico
Employees of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in Sinaloa state caused by organized crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were told that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children to the office, which in 2009 was the target of a grenade attack, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and gut feelings abound.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being on the government’s payroll or the cartel, a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no rest from the violence, and while the bodies are piled up all over the country, more and more journalists are present: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats and so far this year there have been at least seven deaths in seven states.
Among the latter is its editor and its inspirator of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug-related violence.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, show his T-shirts with his type of brilliance.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared issues, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor’s office was set up in 2010 to handle the cases of journalists, it has initiated only two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organized crime each year, the murders of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsolable and although the terrain is now even more treacherous.
Without information about the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little use, says Ibarra.
“It’s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop,” he says.
“Unless we know why, we are all suspicious.”
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot at, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated as "Twelfth River".
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a wife and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman’s arrest last year and his extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country as rival factions struggle here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn’t matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of ornate, two-story mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many houses for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "rest" when only one cartel has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, has broken up with the guilt of not being able to protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
First, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in the war with Guzman’s sons.
This publication may have upset the sons, suspected gang members bought up every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he teamed up with five colleagues to found Riodoce and sold $50 stakes.
In Sinaloa, “it was impossible to engage in journalism without encountering the drug problem,” Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared treat.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious “Maria Moors Cabot Award” for her reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history wherever it led.
He volunteered to admit that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
“You have to take on the task that belongs to you as a journalist – either that or you’re playing the fool.
I don't want to be asked, "What have you done in the face of so many dead ... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird who could curse like a port worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on their routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love for routine his ruin?
His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you deal with their women, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways" to move drugs.
“These things were not allowed,” Bojorquez said.
The result is, even in the best of times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust your own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal said that "smells a sense that can be fooled ... and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa – just as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce’s employees met for security training, suddenly no cell phones were allowed. Days before it was announced that spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen sought protection from the 104-degree (40°C) heat in the shade of a tree.
They were commissioned by the state government to protect Riodoce’s offices in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half-joking, some of the reporters wondered if these officers belonged to the 50 percent of police officers the governor himself called untrustworthy.
It has been months since the reporters went into the mountainous landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week’s edition, Riodoce looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on state spending that focused on the governor’s hometown.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping at one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the prosecutor’s office.
There was no official word on who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite venue of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated almost all political levels throughout the century.
Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of high-profile corruption cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents at this venue, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military assault.
Only a few months earlier, readers would have regarded the column of Valdez as the best-informed source on the kidnapping.
"In the past, we would have known what happened," Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" because of his slender body shape.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
Valdez’s office has been re-dedicated to a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists because the employees have become something they themselves never expected: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning over another journalist at the prosecutor’s office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests, that it is his.
Across the country, journalists have become louder by writing down "SOS Press" on walkways and buildings in organized protests.
On that day, director Bojorquez is away in Washington, trying to collect international support for the justice system in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez’s assassination, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed because they told the truth.
She has since asked that she be reinstated by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were “surrounded” by organized crime, government officials involved in it, and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also at the behest of politicians and security forces who were stuck with organized crime under a blanket.
The media watchdog group "Article 19" assigned more than half of the attacks to police journalists and officials last year.
“In Mexico, you die because they want you to shut up,” Ramirez said.
Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.
Some branches have chosen to close, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of its director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with a headline article on the front page titled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home states or even the country.
It's a painful decision.
It’s hard to find work in exile, and they’re still watching the streets and looking for danger.
And sometimes they are hunted, as it seems to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue the work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trade scares him.
“Mexico is going to hell, and that’s why I became a reporter,” he said.
At midnight on the last Friday, when the last edition had already ended, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office drinking beer as all of a sudden all their phones began to buzz.
A series of shootings with gang rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by a number of Kartell embassies in the region.
From the curb, they published the news on the Riodoce website via mobile.
The front page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens were screaming nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez glanced at the guards to see if they were ready.
If they were scared at all, they didn’t show it.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to the whole of Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce followed in his footsteps.
“How can you even think of closing,” said Bojorquez, “if on the same day that Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her to the street for reporting.”
Dinosaurs used camouflage to evade their enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit a frightening one.
Now, researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible rhino of a Canadian miner have been so well preserved that experts have described it as “Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs.”
It was so well preserved that they could even find that his scaly skin was of reddish brown—and they said she had had something of a “turbulent past.”
The report in the journal Current Biology called him "the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world".
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaur that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly well-preserved condition has stunned researchers who describe it as “really remarkable.”
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant-eater is the best-preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he dug at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.
He came upon something that seemed to be missing from the surrounding rock in the square, and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years uncovering the wild animal within the 2,500-pound (1,100-kg) earth lump.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
“If you just blink a little with your eyes, you might almost think it’s been sleeping,” said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is seen.
"It will go down in scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that this plant-eater, although covered with an armor and resembling a walking tank, was likely threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as countershading, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to better blend in with its surroundings and evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaur family made headlines for the first time in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours carefully uncovering it.
The astonishing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body.
They discovered counter-shading, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, meaning the creature’s tip was darker than its underside.
Although counter-shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopella far exceeds that of the animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure by flesh-eating dinosaurs that evolution favored veiling confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use counter-shading—think of deer, zebras, or belt animals—are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, signaling that this nodosaurus was exposed to a real fight for survival.
"Strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the Cretaceous dinosaur predators must have been," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved intestinal contents, to find out what it ate as its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the seabed.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today.
“This nodosaur is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but also remains preserved in three dimensions and retains the animal’s original shape,” Brown said.
"The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did in the early Cretaceous period.
You don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. If you just pee a little with your eyes, you might almost think that he is asleep."
The Cretaceous period was a time when giant theropods, flesh-eating dinosaurs, stood on two legs, traversed the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his frightening ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 m) long, six-ton heavy monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank into the sea and mummified in mud after death.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he dug at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from the mustache to the hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long tips protruding from his shoulders.
The researchers believe the armored herbivore was swam through western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur kept his armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilized remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skins still cover hollow tank plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as a win in the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.
The fossilized remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armor plates that carry the animal’s skull.
His right forefoot is at his side, his five fingers are spread upwards.
I can count the scales on his sole."
In the thunderstorm: Massenkarambolage on A8: Many injured
Heavy accident on Thursday night on the A8: Nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage.
There are numerous injured, kilometer-long congestion - and gaffer.
On the Stuttgart-Munich (A8) motorway, about 20 people were injured at a mass carambolage late on Thursday afternoon.
According to the first information of the police, around 5 p.m. between the junctions of Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Aichach-Friedberg district) during a thunderstorm, almost 30 vehicles, including probably trucks, were interlocked.
No information was available on the exact number of the injured at first.
These were minor to moderate injuries, a police spokesman said.
A large supply of rescue vehicles was at the scene of the accident.
The A8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich.
In the direction of travel in Munich, a ten-kilometre-long backstop was formed.
As an AZ reporter reports, there were also massive handicaps on the crossroads - due to numerous gaffers.
The fire brigade noted the license plates of the vehicle handlers, who now face sensitive penalties.
Shortly after 18:45, a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a truck and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on its way to the accident site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "Comfort Check-in"
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before: you sit in a train and sleep without knowing anything.
Or you are deep in your work and just have an ingenious thought.
And then: puff.
The creator comes and wakes an unkind person or rips the passenger out of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the days of interruptions are soon over.
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the unresolved ticket control.
You simply confirm by phone that you are taking your seat and devalue the ticket.
Currently, a test operation is running on two routes.
“When the offer comes, we’ll expand it.
It is then expected to be available at the beginning of next year on many other long-distance routes in Germany," a railway spokesman said.
"Comfort check-in" refers to the train as the ticket devaluation without a creator.
However, in order to use them, some requirements must be met: You need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you have to have booked an online ticket - which most passengers do anyway.
You also need to have it via the app of the train that DB Navigator bought, which is the most convenient way of booking a ticket anyway.
And lastly, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: You get on the train, call up your ticket under "My Tickets".
The test customers will then see a button for electronic devaluation.
The train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that Passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
When the train attendant arrives at the ticket check in place Y, he knows that a passenger with an already devalued online ticket is sitting there.
So you can continue to sleep, continue to work, continue to be silent.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should benefit the passengers.
"Anyone who wants to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train escort staff simply checks in at the DB Navigator himself.
This allows passengers to personalise their travel time on the train,” says Michael Peterson, marketing director of DB Fernverkehr.
Second plus: “And our employees have more time than they do today to address the individual customer needs.”
Those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket checks are among the biggest annoyances.
Because often you yourself, but in any case one of the fellow travelers does not have all the documents you need for devaluing online tickets.
Either the credit card or ID card is missing or another document that must be presented.
The result is endless discussions between the train attendant and the passenger, which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large space and delays in checking your own ticket, and in the end, the creator takes the time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And this only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Other train numbers on the same route have not yet been unlocked.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question, "Whose streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
Just one day after she arrived in New York City, the St. Louis-born woman was sitting on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled across a post from someone from high school.
"Police have just killed an 18-year-old child, and it's still on the street," it said.
Confused that no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle <0x40>TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline.
The rapper from the St. Louis area was in the process of tweeting the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo., live.
He posted a picture of Brown’s lifeless body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She laid down her cell phone to return later in the evening to tweets about people on the Canfield drive.
There were photos of the police gang and people screaming, and of a man who claimed to be Brown’s father, who wore a sign saying, “Ferguson’s police just killed my unarmed son!”
She watched a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman unlocked his gun and shouted, “I’ll kill you...animals all.”
"That's not usual," Ferrell recalled her statement.
“This is not the kind of murder that we have become accustomed to and that we can call typical.”
At that moment, I felt a chill.
I was angry and crying.”
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father’s house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the theme of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?", in the cinemas from the 11th century onwards.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resilience, which consists from the perspective of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell and her daughter, wearing a floral dress and a matching crown, drove to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation they had had countless times before this morning “about the black experience and the black state.”
“Do you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?” she recalled what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take her with me," Ferrell said later.
“What happened today is a climax of what happened in the past.
She needs to know it and see it and be raised in it.
It must be well-developed, not only activism and organization, but also know the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to become free to liberate ourselves.
Even though I’m lucky enough to give her an experience where she doesn’t personally experience blatant racism, she’s no different than the next black woman child.
I feel like I would do her a disservice to keep her away."
The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was at South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a camp site when the activists waited for the possible non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrell and her daughter teamed up with a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly, a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.
“My activism has changed completely since August 9,” she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
“I had no experience in organizing.
It's all here."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to “document” what happened.
One question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can take advantage of?"
This scepticism was fueled by countless cases of people, often whites – in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan recently explained in an interview: “We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson didn’t center their voices and we wanted to do it differently.”
Folayan had already collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field known for his activism around death row inmates.
Ferrell brought the project closer, along with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us, we are talking," Davis said.
“That was the main thing for me, how these people are represented, because that’s how I’ll be represented.”
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell’s experience — to show that the movement is “not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together,” Folayan said — she proved to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" reveal surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she falls in love and marries her wife.
“I felt like naked,” Ferrell said, laughing when she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I have understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people."
In addition, Ferrell’s story repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who shaped the film "BlacklivesMatter" on social media after the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, identify as gay.
“Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall,” Ferrell said, “and that’s why we’re constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women have to bear the main burden of everything.”
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really being upheld by black women and many black women".
However, she insists that "this is not an affirmative type of action", in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film due to her identity.
“She was the person who shook that energy,” she said.
"It's no coincidence, although she was at the forefront, because there's so much at stake in a life at these crossroads as a black, gay woman.
You can feel their energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial ties between the community and the police continue.
Ferrell is on probation for 21<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 years for blocking a highway during a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area, which she calls her home: "A chaos".
Nevertheless, she clings to a song and feels obliged to this memory since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains.”
From "Dream" to "Size Madness": TV Readers Discuss Bit Gallery
The Bit Gallery moves people, even though it hasn’t been built for a long time.
But the idea of a shopping mall at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has split the population into proponents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
Cold leaves hardly one of them.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".
While one says to the bit gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really cool" (Nicole Schausten), from the other side comes: "Don't need a man" (Siggi Betten) or quite simply: "Great madness!" (Lars Scholz).
While proponents rely on a gallery to attract more customers to the city, which also benefits other businesses, opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bleed out.
In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the site where the Farmer’s Market Hall is located, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
With the start of the construction work, this will be over.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda square with the possibility to sit outside.
Simone Zimmer: "For many years now, we have been buying almost weekly in the farmer's market hall.
Mostly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the peasant women always very much like.
We also discovered the butchery for ourselves.
We would like to see an opportunity to maintain this offer even during and especially after the construction of the gallery.
In other cities this is also the case.
Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting."
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent.
However, it should not be too low for the new project.”
Eva Kilic: "Why shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothes, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find this superfluous.
There is enough of that in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is all the more important that we at least keep the market hall.
After all, the product offered there is fresh, is mostly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive.
As you can see, shops in a shopping center are rented only by larger companies, because the rents there are often not portable for a retailer.
Too bad, there are almost no special deals left and what is left of it will probably disappear."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping center with a market hall does not fit for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit in with Bitburg.
In particular, where should the farmer’s market hall go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit gallery actually comes.
Or does the Ghost Bit-Gallery manage to dispose of all the shops from Bitburg before?"
George Marquet: “It just won’t work.
And a shopping center that stands empty doesn’t need anyone either.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmers’ market instead of this gallery.
But for a farmer's market hall, thanks to the insanely many - as I find - senseless construction projects in Bitburg, there is no more room.
If the farmer's market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again."
A fitting similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces can be seen - white, black and brown, which almost imperceptibly resemble each other - hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek tuples and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the clips from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where the former intelligence analyst was serving a 35-year prison sentence after making public classified diplomatic reports via the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and the arts, and Manning, a transwoman and pioneering dissident whose conviction of Barack Obama was transformed when he had only three days left in office.
Dewey-Hagborg, through the algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted from Manning and created from the 30 portraits, has made a sharp, albeit somewhat intellectual commentary not only on the formability of DNA data – the many ways in which it can be interpreted and the inherent determinism – but also on the creation of this identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has spoken openly about identifying as a woman since her puberty, was convicted of 20 counts in 2013, including six violations of the Espionage Act, computer fraud, and theft.
Through the prison, her image was suppressed, so much so that there was only one photo — a grainy, black-and-white selfie, in which Manning was visibly uncomfortable sitting on a driver’s seat and wearing a platinum-blonde wig — with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came just from the great success of their 2012 project 'Stranger Vision'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butt and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to create an image of what these people might look like.
That was the moment she received an email from a newspaper magazine.
“They were doing an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted some sort of portrait to accompany this article,” Dewey-Hagborg told a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn’t be visited at that time and she couldn’t be photographed, so they contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to do a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal letter friends, who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, "Suppressed Images", which predicted a future in which the President would transform Chelsea's judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would in fact demand Manning’s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas just a few days after the book was published was a welcome kind of happy rendezvous.
There is something deep and strong about the opening of the exhibition, too, as Donald Trump wages a war against government informants and transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further ignite the rigid divisions he was supposed to fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason".
In an artistic statement written on the gallery wall, Manning, with her oversized signature underneath (the "i" in her family name is hearted), called for an end to "automatic fragmentation based on gender, race, sexuality, and culture."
On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand footer of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by incorporating the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist) how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we all are.
“What people will hopefully take away from this is that our genome doesn’t care about who we are and how open genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective it is,” said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also shown.
“DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that’s 30 of those stories.”
The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in its own room, is a page from the comic novel mentioned above.
She shows Manning how she shows up with a hands-free phone in her hand from the disciplinary barracks of the United States like King-Kong.
“If they cool down your speech, then they’ve won,” it says.
"So never shut your mouth".
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist, who hails from Philadelphia.
"I still get goosebumps when I talk about it."
Manning hasn’t seen the exhibition in person yet – as predicted predictably in the comic book – but if she should do it, then she’ll be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulacrums, flocking together like hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5<0xE2><0x80><0xB2><0xE2><0x80><0xB2> 2, Manning’s stature), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.
“In the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd,” Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
“I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind their liberation.”
Professor of Northwestern University and Oxford University employee wanted for murder
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who are wanted as suspects after a man was stabbed in a luxury Chicago apartment with fatal injuries.
On Monday, arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for murder over their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the files of the Cook County District Court show.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches.
A community warning system published by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still pronounced dead at the scene, and detectives are investigating the stitches as murder, while police are actively searching for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president of university relations, said in an email statement that Lathem was now on leave and had been excluded from entering Northwestern University’s campus.
“This is now a criminal matter that is being investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation,” Cubbage said.
Warren is a Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesperson for the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to assist the U.S. intelligence agencies in any way possible."
The statement added that Warren’s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand up.
Chicago Police Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi said he strongly urges the suspects to confront the authorities.
“The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them are intensifying,” Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip that said something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza management team issued a statement to residents: “Police are currently working on the victim’s timeline and background, investigating a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident.”
"We will conclude the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) were implemented.
"At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has been granted the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard," Mutko said on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of WADA’s roadmap to comply with the Code, which describes the criteria for the re-establishment of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization’s website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia.
“Everything has been announced, everything has been implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future,” he added.
However, one of the criteria listed in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA-approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren into alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
Regarding the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation as our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programs, and we will not admit anything that does not exist.”
Mutko’s words were in line with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission.
In a conversation with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally,” Smirnov added.
RUSADA was banned from conducting doping controls in Russia in November 2015 as a result of the WADA doping scandal.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
Following a visit to the organization’s headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli said that RUSADA is “moving in the right direction” to be deployed again.
Aldi no longer sells eggs
This was reported by the company groups.
It is a purely precautionary measure, no further detriment to health can be expected, the statement said.
From now on, only eggs should be delivered to Aldi, which have been tested negatively for fipronil-containing anti-spasmodics.
Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency with its customers.
The Start-Ups That Will Help Your Business Not Become the Next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure your employee’s luck with your e-commerce startup, but the surveys didn’t work.
The answers were often vague, unhelpful, or, worse, fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers didn’t trust the process.
“There was simply never consistency and objectivity,” said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.
She called people from outside for help.
A new breed of Human Resources start-ups is on the rise to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, target special groups and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases, allow whistleblowers to direct themselves to engage in leadership.
“You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where is the Fitbit for your business?” said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City startup Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of specific teams, it offers a company heat map that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval results – so you can drill down why.
Businesses come to realize that they need to stay at the forefront of workplace culture so that you don’t become the next Uber to get involved in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who spoke were punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to financial website Let’s Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increase in interest and activity earlier this year amid the Uber case in discredit.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized “pulse” surveys, collect confidential answers in real time, and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And when the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the supervisory board.
“The court of public opinion has captured the regulators,” said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and CEO of Convercent.
If a company is found to be mistreating its employees or behaving unethically, it can experience costly consequences due to consumer boycott, employee fluctuation, and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters, file a formal complaint, and hope that he or she was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidating and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday’s General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company uses Convercent, problems previously hidden from executives sitting in offices in cities or states—such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair practices—can be identified and addressed more quickly.
“I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view into the employment experience,” said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday’s Risk Management Group.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment litigation."
Companies began taking ethics, values, and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations caused by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took until the “social media came to their right” that companies realized that they couldn’t prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
“Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, and charge companies with recurring fees for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.
Glitzern secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its total funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today’s employees expect more from their jobs than ever before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just stakes.
Employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
“If people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices are heard, and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to making that company successful,” said Nina McQueen, vice president of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convert and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well. Companies run well when employees are committed and committed.
If the third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement and engagement, it’s no wonder you’ll find support.
The data on employee engagement is important according to the experts of the workplace culture.
But the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for your feedback, they may have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if change doesn’t come quickly enough, or doesn’t come at all, it can breed disappointments and demotivate employees.
“If you’re asking for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations,” said Russell Raath, president of consulting at the business management firm Kotter International, which has seen companies rely too much on data collection.
“Because if you don’t follow, employees will ask themselves, ‘Did you really hear me?
Do you care about that?
And who doesn’t care, why should I?”
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate action on the same day when a Glint problem is reported, according to Errett.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganize multiple teams within the company and add communication training to address the issues through the speed of decision-making and quality of communication.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is constantly gaining new insights about its employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to a better bonding of employees in an industry known for high revenues.
“If you’re not obligated to create a culture of transparency, you’re going to lose the people,” Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, then you will lose businesses.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It’s 11:00 p.m. when a crowd of UCLA football players are chatting on one side of the team’s new practice fields on campus.
Some have removed their jersey tops and show their backs full of sweat from the first day of training camp.
For a good part of the team, these idle minutes are a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Wasserman Football Center the next morning at 6:30am.
"This is a real kick-off for the boys for the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the burden on players, and it has actually extended their days – at least until the finals on Friday.
Therefore, the first three UCLA training sessions should begin at 7:15 p.m. to meet the already packed schedules of players.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after last season and conducted practical exercises during the summer school for the first time during Moras's six seasons in Westwood.
They are scheduled to hold 18 drills in the course of August, 20 before the start of formal game preparations for their debut against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said he supports the NCAA rule change, even if it adds another point to players’ busy routes.
“We’re putting this enormous burden on them for three or four days, and it’s very challenging,” Mora said.
“And they just pushed it through, they keep sticking around, they’re great people.
I think once we get there by Saturday and we have more time, it’s going to be really great.”
UCLA will end its practices once the camp is finished, which, given the clear lines of view of its fields, will not be an easy task from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, a high-class hotel that has already been tossed with footballs that clear a protective net behind a gatepost.
Bruins players are expected to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem once these rooms are available during the season.
“We will use our security,” Mora said.
“That’s a real problem, and it’s not far-fetched to think that people are renting a room there and then setting up there to record an exercise.
If you have the videotape of an exercise, it’s a pretty good deal.
But we've got security there, and we've got security on parking lot 8.
We will do our best with what we have.
I'm not too worried about that.
We have a plan.”
Facebook wants to intensify fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third-party fact-checkers and then display their results under the original post, the world’s largest online social network said on Thursday. It is one of its efforts to fight so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will begin using updated machine learning methods to detect possible misreports and send them to fact-checkers who may display fact-check results from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe they also influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters being flooded with false stories ahead of the presidential elections in May, and Germany supporting a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to post hate-filled posts as they did before the elections there in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-check would be launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to knowing which stories are being challenged by third-party fact-checkers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share,” said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook News in a blog post.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the “related article” and is working on other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
Creating a Comic-Novel: A Castle in the History of England
In its younger past, the little Scotney Castle was featured in a squeeze music video and was a sleeper for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy seat in Kent’s Bewl River Valley and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaar Yorkshireman with a fondness for historical documents.
“I think it’s so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who’s been dead for 300 years,” he said.
"What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' spans the time from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney, each story being illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It’s not Rhodes’ first book based on an archive: He wrote ‘Dead Men’s Teeth and Other Stories’ in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library – a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
“I only reacted to the thumbprint on the page of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins,” he says.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell of smoke, because at that time a fire was kindled because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as if he were also involved.
I love the archives!”
For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest: I've overrated my welcome greeting a little bit") all this seems too nice to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, looking through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the trench.
He wandered through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscapers, gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "whiskey and started writing".
Scotney’s intimate history is relatively unknown, as the National Trust did not gain full access until 2006, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees were just beginning to take care of the archive he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said "Oh, throw it on the attic".
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps depicting who possessed what: "One might think land conflicts would be boring," Rhodes says, "but there was a birch to have fought for by the two families.
Guys, let it all go!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to delve into English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
"There is a record of a riot that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," Rhodes says.
"The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought a rebellion was a good start.
Maybe the two are connected?”
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit Father, whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery made only years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed quite crooked, constantly making debts and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women — I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking boys, with a talent to promote heirlooms.”
After the end of its use in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has left behind a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämäki, the site of an early 20th-century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go back," he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to deal with the damn life again."
Campaign launched: Over 300-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf
With the camouflage of the 301 year old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef on Friday started its campaign to introduce a new roof brand (roundshow of Thursday).
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret.
At the end of August, the highlight of the campaign will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth.
"Too nice for us.
Or?", the makers of the action have asked since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer chapel.
“We don’t really think so (of course!),” they wrote on their website released yesterday.
“But we’re using this measure to get your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than they seem.
Basically, we are of the firm belief that as Bad Honnefer citizens we know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
The action is about more than "just" a logo and a slogan, it continues.
"It is necessary to formulate a stand-alone promise, one that gives the city an unmistakable stand-alone feature".
After all, it is in competition with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef can afford its new roof brand and the campaign for an average five-digit amount.
Turkey's Military Reforms - Erdogan's Fear of the Army
Every year at the beginning of August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) in Ankara advises on retirements and promotions in the officer corps.
This week, too.
At first glance, a normal process.
But nothing is routine among the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff building, as before, but in the Prime Minister's office.
The five Deputy Prime Ministers as well as the Ministers of Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the deliberations under the chairmanship of the Head of Government.
Thus, the civilians in the YAS were in the majority.
The government is pulling the reins in the military.
Chief of General Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the air force and the navy were deposed.
Since the failed coup, Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
Over 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the ranks of the army – mostly because of alleged links to the movement of exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as the wire puller of the coup attempt.
A total of 486 people who are said to have been directly involved in the coup attempt will be held in Ankara this week.
Already the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the coup attempt a "gift of God" as he gave him the opportunity to "completely clean up" the armed forces.
But does Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an really control the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article titled "Discomfort in the military headquarters".
In the General Staff there are concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which manifests itself among other things in the lifting of the ban on headscarves for female soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
In any case, the large-scale cleansing of the army and security forces continues.
In mid-July, Erdogan ordered the firing of another 7,395 civil servants, including 2,303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
It was as if Erdogan had tamed the military.
The generals were formerly considered to be the actual lords of the country.
Three times they purged, citing their role as guardians of the worldly state order.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least on the basis of the reform requirements of the European Union.
Former officers say Erdogan is deliberately pushing for an Islamization of the armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe", an unnamed officer who sought asylum after the coup attempt for fear of persecution abroad warned that the Turkish army would be "full extremists and Salafists" in a few years.
If this is the case, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
Nevertheless, after the clean-up, there are doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army.
The leadership structures and operational capabilities are “weakened,” say NATO diplomats.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, President Donald Trump said, quoted by the media.
It envisages reducing legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter regulations for obtaining visas for a temporary work permit, and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The bill will be discussed in both chambers of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way that citizens from other countries are issued Green Cards.”
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English, who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy,” Trump said.
Ministry wants to renovate track for Rennsteigshuttle
Over the past few months, the future of the Rennsteigshuttle has been debated over and over again - now it should go very quickly.
Even before the end of the year, it is planned to be built on the marooned route on which the tourist railway runs.
In order to secure the future of the racetrack shuttle in the long term, construction work on the track is expected to begin this year, according to the Ministry of Transport.
"With the decision to continue ordering and renovating the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committed to this connection, which is especially important for tourism," Transport State Secretary Klaus Sühl said on Friday in Erfurt.
The cost of repairing the route amounted to about 2.5 million euros.
Of this amount, the country takes over 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle will be ordered by the country in the future, is currently being finalized, Sühl said.
The Ministry and the South Thuringian Railways as operators already agree on the technical details.
"This negotiates the timetable, the vehicles used and the quality standards," said Sühl.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years.
The Rennsteig-Shuttle is scheduled to be ordered regularly in December 2017.
The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a popular rail connection between the stations Ilmenau and Rennsteig.
In recent months, a pilot operation has tested whether the route will be used by enough people to order it regularly again in the future.
The track is also highly degradable in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried
Just when you thought it couldn’t get any more crazy in 2017, a new report comes out on the technological developments in the field of sex robots.
Yeah, actually.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.
“People are making fun of them, but the companies are delivering a lot of it, and we’re going to get to see them even more often,” Mr Sharkey said in the release of his new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm – with conscious human reactions achieved through artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adapt" his robot according to his beliefs, selecting everything from the eye color of the robot, the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it becomes even more troubling, as many robots possess the “personalities” that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.
The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like “Frigid Farrah” that conveys the impression of shyness and “Wild Wendy” with an “adventurous” personality.
“Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well-adapted to your personality as possible,” the True Companion website boasts.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn’t like what you don’t like, etc.
She also has her moods during the day - just like real people!
She may be tired, fixated on conversation, or she may be “in the mood”!”
There are many disturbing aspects to this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics, the hints of rape, when one steps to Frigid (here: reluctant) Farrah, disturb one the most.
On his website, True Companion compared Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have Roxxxy?"
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Its emergence and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Most men will of course not have sex robots, and while the FRR notes their growing popularity, they still remain on the fringes of consumer culture for the time being.
But what is leaking out of the outer zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not weird or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging at a time when women’s rights are threatened worldwide, when there is a president in the White House who has bragged about sexually assaulting women.
The most frightening aspect of the TV series 'The Handmaid's Tale' are not the graphic images, the entangled bodies and the outstretched eyes, but how realistic this vision looks.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but right now it doesn’t feel like a big leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical resemblance to actual women as realistically as technically possible (albeit with porn star proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, to imitate the movement of a real body.
But, brought to the point, when it comes to their “personalities,” the robots don’t represent real women.
You can’t separate from your companion or just walk away.
They have no mediation or background history, nothing that suggests independence, or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are happy slaves.
Or to put it in the 2017 speech: maids
Trump's great performance?
He makes Mitt Romney the embodiment of common sense.
It has become a binary of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the U.S. electorate have also split families in a small format.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the U.S. advising on how to deal with the horror of Trump’s election relatives.
We all supposedly tighten up to let our filter bubbles burst.
Less noted is Trump’s power to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has been dealing with Republicans in our family for a long time, visited me in New York this week.
It reminded me that unity can have a powerful effect against a common enemy.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican kinship she had fought with for decades over politics, is suddenly and quite peculiarly on the same side.
This is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but it strikes me in a further context that this also entails considerable risks.
The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the shocking effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about “normalization” and Trump, we are referring to the creepy possibility that someday his bitches won’t turn us away.
However, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans, who suddenly appear to be an implication of reasonableness compared to his standards.
I find myself today plagued by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney’s hilarious version of the madman—the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like)—both of which in fact appear to be a very mild offense compared to Trump.
When Trump leaves, the Republicans’ next candidate just needs to be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the New York Park department carousels, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don’t need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all the clowns are crunchy and the animals twist to look over their own shoulders full of fear - extremely dark and the climaxing music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: The views of tall buildings get old, the skylines become too familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I’m still not quite through the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss Cottage – the themed pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage doesn’t count – but a large roundabout in North London.
However, the Central Park carousel is still a strangely magical experience, as here two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in their 40s can go on it and all have a great time.
If I could have rated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.
On the other hand, I was forced this week in a department store to rate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pull through my credit card.
In the coffee house at the corner of my street it’s the same, plus the option to match the rating with a 15% tip – this to buy something over the counter.
This not only slows down what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required.
The poor woman in the department store was apologetically grinning, while I was tired of the experience of giving her my five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius relocated from prison to hospital with chest pain
Pistorius has left the prison for a second visit to the hospital.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital for the treatment of cuts to his wrists, which he suffered after a case in his cell, according to prison authorities.
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal by prosecutors against a first death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine’s Day 2013 by shooting her through a door of the toilet booth in his Pretoria home several times.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nocturnal intruder hiding in the cabin.
Prosecutors have announced their intention this time to file a six-year prison sentence against Pistorius Appeal, which they say is too lenient.
The National Prosecution Service said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius is in danger of being sentenced to 15 years if the prosecutors succeed.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberger schools, the fourth graders from Fützen and Epfenhofen were released for the holidays and to the secondary schools.
Three of the discharge students will go to high school in the future, four to the real school.
Head of school Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
The 29 pupils of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle, who grew up in the chicken farm, but then was released.
To this end, the merry crowd performed a musical entitled "The Eagle in the Chicken Farm".
Farmer Arnold found a strange egg, and let it hatch from his chickens.
Instead of a chicken coop, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of turning him into a chicken was shattered, the eagle spread out its wings on a high mountain and escaped.
After that, classes three and four showed a chicken dance in Yvonne Frank’s one-to-one study.
The hens danced with the young goblins that carried cylinders to bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said school principal Angelika Sitte.
The young animal is different from the other young animals (kitchens), but belongs to them.
He will never be like a chicken.
Its purpose is to be free.
She wished every fourth grader that he felt accepted in his new school.
This was followed by a word of thanks to the colleagues, the former head of the school Michael Müller, who repeatedly jumps in at school shortages, and the parents’ representatives.
The chicken season is now over, class teacher Sophia Schumacher explained.
She is very reluctant to dismiss her students after two years of teaching, because it was a really great time.
Eventually, she was able to rely on the fourth graders.
In the end, all the students had a song of summer time and holiday time.
There was great joy in the children.
Eight first graders have already registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians have been detained for illegal camping in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, quoted by TV.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of illegally tenting people, including the two Bulgarians, were arrested by the police in Sithonia.
They were released on the same day, while an investigation is currently underway.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported to bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camping and impose significant fines on anyone who is found to be staying in a place not intended for this purpose.
The checks will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.

At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust behavior of cars of the emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6.
Euro-4 diesel or worse is excluded.
Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
“The mandatory updates previously apply only to vehicles that have malware,” says Anja Smetanin.
Their retrofitting has been ordered by the Federal Motor Vehicle Authority (KBA).
How and from when will customers be informed about updates?
The manufacturers have announced a speedy implementation in the coming months, but have not yet specified an exact date.
Daimler has said to write to each affected person.
If an inspection is due anyway, it will be done within their framework.
How long will the changes be expected to last?
“It’s hard to say,” Smetanin said.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as political pressure.
"Because we have seen that the car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the issue of the environment so far."
How long will the update take?
The conversion itself could only take three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more time consuming to get an appointment.
What do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE advises to wait.
Foreign manufacturers are likely to follow suit, according to Smetanin.
Is there a massive drop in the price of Euro 4 cars?
The ACE fears this.
But in the regions where driving bans threaten.
In rural areas, there is no loss of value for older diesels so far.
The ACE advises to wait with a sale.
LL Cool J Receives Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award ceremony under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the prize winners does not want to come - out of protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the prestigious Kennedy Center’s coveted awards.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, this year also singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) as well as choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the honorees.
The awards will be presented at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, U.S. President Donald Trump will host a reception and participate in the ceremony with his wife Melania.
The award-winning progressive TV series winner Lear has already announced that he will not participate in the gala.
He told the New York Times: “This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights – even to deprive them of the means – and that burdens me.”
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she will use the conversation with Trump to clarify her point of view.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural center in the U.S. capital.
Previous winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslach’s city builder, will retire next year.
The position has already been announced - however, suitable applicants are rare.
Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years.
And he still enjoys his work, as he conveys in the press conference.
He reports on varied but also challenging tasks that are waiting for his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that so far no application meets the requirements profile.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer as soon as possible.
In this way, while respecting the regular notice periods, there should still be enough time for processing.
Since Haslach acts as the Lower Building Rights Authority for the administrative community, the applicant must present corresponding degrees.
This is why the city wants to retain this function.
If they can no longer fill it out, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.
But proximity to citizens is important to the city and to himself, says Wacker, who reports on a good operating climate and a good mood between the authorities and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, several important projects have accumulated, which Wacker looks back on with pride.
"We make the city worth living," he is sure about the construction office and its employees.
But also in the future, varied projects are on the agenda: the redesign of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofen parking lot, for example, have been initiated.
The Kinzigbrücke between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, and the stadium renovation is still a topic.
The latter alone will cost around 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right", estimates Wacker.
"All in all, great tasks are waiting for my successor.
The work here is fun.”
There is a lot of room for design for a city builder.
With Haslach’s own construction yard and gardening, it is possible to react to many things quite flexibly.
"You can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the greenery is often praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town as an ensemble is under monument protection, it is important to "have an eye for what fits in" when new buildings are approved, emphasizes the outgoing city builder.
In any case, the city builder bears a high responsibility.
He is the builder, "in the end everything is running over my table."
In terms of support and coordination, he can count on long-time employees: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been with him for ten years, Manfred Schöner (Tiefbau) for 15 years.
Also, that his successor stays long, Wacker wishes: "We are looking for someone who really identifies with the position and wants to stay".
Continuity is not only important for a good operating climate, but also for the further design of the city.
According to the City of Haslach, those who wish to inherit Roland Wacker should be able to present a completed degree as a graduate engineer or a bachelor with a specialization in architecture and have good specialist knowledge in the areas of construction planning and planning law.
The city building office is subject to construction and landscaping, construction planning, land acquisition matters, administration of urban properties, urban farmhouse with construction yard and urban gardening as well as Lower Building Rights Authority including monument protection.
Bicycle tossed on lines: southern railway line blocked
According to police, the hitherto unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track crossing in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) onto the lines.
These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators assume two male offenders and have been looking for them since the night hours.
Near the crime scene, a pink-red scooter and a bicycle driver had been observed by witnesses.
"This goes far beyond a stroke of luck," <0xC3><0x96>BB spokesman Christoph Posch told APA.
The perpetrator or perpetrators would have put themselves in great danger and also endangered train traffic.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the system, as well as the delay minutes and the cost of rail replacement traffic, there could also be penalties for railway customers to the perpetrators.
All in all, a “substantial” sum should be assumed, the spokesman said.
The damage was repaired on Friday afternoon, the rail traffic on the southern railway line could be conducted without any handicaps.
Nearly ten passenger trains had fallen out on Friday morning, two of which concerned long-distance traffic.
There were no freight trains, but they were delayed.
According to <0xC3><0x96>BB spokesman Christoph Posch, about 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (Inflammatory bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare to your digestive system.
But a new study claims the exact opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition, which affects about 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan from proteins contributes to the development of immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the gut patrol to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not enter the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease can result.
In experiments it was found that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cells occurs in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their intestines.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan – one of the building blocks of proteins – to trigger the appearance of cells.
Professor Colonna said: “We have established a link between a bacterial species – Lactobacillus reuteri – which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more of these immune cells they had.”
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet promotes a more tolerant, less inflammatory gut environment, if the same system works in humans.
Postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that one group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same strain, but housed separately, did not.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the gut microbiomes of the mice—the community of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of the mice were DNA-sequenced and six bacteria species were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells but without them were missing in the mice.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so they lacked a gut microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells formed.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers allowed L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid — without the bacteria — to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice’s diet, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in humans with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said, "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the gut.
Potentially, high tryptophan levels in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have committed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United has signed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic, Jose Mourinho believes, after the midfielder had his debut on Wednesday night against Sampdoria.
Chelsea’s <0xC2><0xA3>40 million signing began with a 2:1 win in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup starts against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the keeper role as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira progressed at will.
However, Matic had been excluded from the preparatory Asia tour of the Blues and managed only 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
“He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks — he thinks football,” Mourinho said.
"We will help him to be ready sooner rather than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at Aviva Stadium, when Mourinho formed his starting XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job" of fulfilling three of its four priority new commitments.
"To get three out of four, I thank the club for that," he added.
“I’ll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they’ve put in a lot of effort.”
Boeing "paints" dreamliner in the sky
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots flew off from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in the U.S. state of Michigan and pulled in the form of a dreamliner over the United States, which is several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and a minute.
On the radar screens was the shape of a dreamliner.
The whole thing was a test of endurance for new engines.
Boeing has done this kind of advertising before.
So the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New low strike for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
As the wind spins: When Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD leader, Social Democratic prime ministers were always looking to Berlin with some concern before elections.
Just no conflagration from the party headquarters, just no counterwind from the federal government - that was the main wish of the election fighters.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, that has changed fundamentally.
Since then, the employees of the Willy-Brandt-Haus have been watching with growing horror the events in the SPD-ruled state capitals.
What Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with counterwind.
It was deep blows.
One after the other.
The Federal CDU sees the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony as a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens.
"This shows once again: Red-Green simply cannot govern reliably," CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber told the German editorial network (RND).
The surprise exit of a Green MP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the parliamentary elections, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from the CDU and FDP.
Greens chief executive Michael Kellner has asked Elke Twesten, a renegade member of the Greens in Lower Saxony, to resign.
The move to the CDU means a clear distortion of the will of the electorate.
Each Twesten must immediately return their mandate," the German leader and campaigner for the Greens told the Redaktionsnetz Deutschland (RND).
“This cannot be true at all,” sighs an SPD campaigner, as the new Job message reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD Minister-President of Lower Saxony, is there after the transfer of the Green MP Elke Twesten to the CDU without his own government majority.
It is the provisional climax of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD country associations.
And no one knows what's next.
The misery began with the unexpectedly clear defeat in the Saarland elections in March.
A blue eye, no more, reassured the comrades at the time.
After the parliamentary elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
That was the case, and it all got much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to a standstill, the Düsseldorf-Pleite haute the party smoothly.
The comrades returned in the weeks that followed.
Then, when they had just gained new courage, the G20 summit came from Hamburg.
And with him came the next deep blow.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD country leader, lost his nimbus that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was burning.
And because he did pretty much everything wrong in crisis communication afterward that one can do wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
And now also Stephan Weil.
Due to the VW exhaust gas affair and his role on the Supervisory Board, the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has long been in the spotlight.
Mise poll values were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because of this, Weil has been trying increasingly to put accents in the federal government in recent weeks.
The desire of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin, even comrades in the environment of Martin Schulz did not remain hidden.
They granted it because they promised to stabilise the party.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
Because there is basically no guilt in the internal dispute between the Greens in Lower Saxony.
Schulz is not.
In the meantime, the comrades therefore try to keep their own ranks closed.
Their anger is directed at the Greens, and especially at the apostate parliamentarian Twesten.
“It is intolerable and damaging to democracy how Ms. Twesten puts her own career interests above the interests of everyone else,” says Matthias Miersch, head of party leaders in the SPD-Bundestagsfraktion, the Redaktionsnetz Deutschland (RND).
Ms Twesten has not been elected to parliament because of her person as a direct candidate, but through the national list of the Greens in Lower Saxony.
The logical consequence would be for her to relinquish her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD-Bundestag faction, lamented an "undemocratic maneuver".
“The will to vote four years ago was clear: the people made Stephan Weil prime minister,” says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxon SPD as the top candidate in the Bundestag elections, the RND.
"Now the personal career thought of a future CDU MP distorts the election result," Oppermann said.
He asked to clarify the backgrounds.
I want to know if there have been more or if there have been further commitments by the CDU in Lower Saxony.
Funding for local core III
Anyone who wants to renovate their house in the years to come can soon get support from the country.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG Stadtentwicklung informed about this on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler gave another look back at what has happened so far.
Since 1991 there have been rehabilitation areas in Empfingen.
At that time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the Land of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the amount of funding.
In the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still at 60 percent.
For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "successful project" - after all, it is important to also promote interior development, and not only to open up new construction areas.
On April 4th, the Karlsruhe government bureau informed them that there would be a rehabilitation area III.
The amount of funding is 833,333 euros, of which 500,000 euros would come from the country, the rest from the municipality of Empfingen.
How is a rehabilitation area created?
Schindler continues to investigate where the “really old” houses are.
However, it also plays a role whether there is any interest in renovating the planned area.
If necessary, the boundaries of the territory could then be shifted again.
The STEG represented on Wednesday evening Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.
Keller presented the contents of the federal-country program "Social City", in the framework of which the renovations would then be carried out.
At the heart of the programme are the revitalisation of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the preservation and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out on an object-based basis, i.e. per plot.
The rehabilitation area would then eventually be defined as a statute.
The eligibility period for the funding runs from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
Until September of this year, however, the stocktaking would only be carried out once, as part of which the participants in the rehabilitation area will receive a questionnaire to be filled in.
In November or December, the statutory decision should be made as much as possible, so that the renovations can be started in the coming year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality had to carry out the said preliminary investigations.
It is a question of assessing urban maladministration and deciding when and to what extent it will be rehabilitated.
A renovation notice will then also be entered in the land register for the respective plot.
Pietzschmann herself will come back to Empfingen and get a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the involvement of the stakeholders.
Therefore, there will be questionnaires that will be sent to citizens by post in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and land" questionnaire, which deals, among other things, with the structural condition and the renovation intentions.
In the grey questionnaire, the "household and housing sheet", information on the size, distribution and inhabitants of a living space can be made.
The blue "operating sheet" is only to be filled out if business premises are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding.
In addition, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler also emphasized that the distribution of funding works according to the "windhund principle" - who comes first, grinds first.
You can't "reserve" funding for later.
Finally, photos of the project "Local Core II" were shown in order to make a renovation "tasteful" for those present.
British inventor sets himself a microchip to get in the house and car with a hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip so that he can open his front door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service to businesses and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has teamed up with Dr. Geoff Watson, an anaesthetic consultant at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is performed to medical standards.
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam’s company also wants to change the locks on houses and cars to be compatible with the chip, all for a fee of <0xC2><0xA3>300 per lock.
The married father of one has now installed both at home and with his BMW Z4 technology, which begins when his hand is at the wheel.
The advertising costs of the White House cost the taxpayer thousands of dollars.
The White House’s decision to fly a naval helicopter to South Lawn for an event highlighting U.S. manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $24,000, according to the military, which was left to TIME magazine.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the president is on board, was the centerpiece of the July 17 event at the White House featuring American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials took a tour of products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut-made helicopter was exhibited alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi.
The military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," the HMX-1 commander wrote to his superior, the deputy naval commander for aviation, on the eve of the event.
The news indicated that the helicopter arrived at South Lawn for the event at 3 p.m. on July 17 at 7 a.m., and remained there until the lawn was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. that evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House was to be delayed, a second crew would be needed for the return flight due to the limitation of duty hours.
The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security personnel remained on the ground with the aircraft for the time being.
The records provided to TIME did not make it clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately necessary.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the determination.
"One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
“Sounds like you’re locked up,” the deputy commander replied.
The event "Made in America" was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the president gave an impetus to the reform of health reform that was underway in the Senate, and he propagated efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the trip.
But requesting their use only for a photo-op is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential plane was providing taxi services amid his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of reports complaining about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessor.
“The White House is thrilled with the show ‘Made In America’ – which showcases products from all 50 states made by American workers using American materials,” said White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews frequently conduct training flights in the Washington area and in South Lawn to depose the U.S. president in the White House with precise inch sets.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 drills in the White House.
The flight for the “Made in America” event counted in the flight crew’s training needs for the month, an official said.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours that day for “non-presidency support missions.”
The White House said taxpayers did not take over the burden of any of the other props presented at the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in exhibiting the helicopter on South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to U.S. Department of Defense hourly rates for the 2017 fiscal year, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is USD 24,380 per flight hour.
The unit records the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is well below this rate.
“Determining the costs for taxpayers based on the estimates of the rebate rates is highly misleading,” Walters said.
"These estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual appropriations."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contracting.
At that time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to present things this week that are made in America,” Spicer said.
And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands, of people depend on it.
And I think like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight this."
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver’s seat of a firefighter car.
In the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of corporate products.
“I know Sikorsky very well,” the president said, “I have three of them.”
TC BW Nose before tricky task
The top rider of the Second Tennis Bundesliga competes at the third table of Suchsdorfer SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will start tomorrow at 11 a.m. in Kiel at the third table at Suchsdorfer SV.
Despite five games still flawless record, the top rider of the Second Tennis Bundesliga has retained a sense of reality.
Team leader Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in a very similar formation.
I think the team is very good in the back positions."
Class and stability at Suchsdorfer SV are mainly ensured by imports from the high north.
"The Danes and Finns can even refer to bets in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in doubles,” says Zay with a view to Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
“As always, it will be difficult for us.
You also need a good portion of luck.”
The Neusser team for the trip to the high north is practical.
His debut for Blue and White could be given to Maxime Janvier.
If the Frenchman still active in the Challenger tournament in Biella, Italy, does not make it to the Bundesliga party, Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic), who plays in the tournament in Liberec, Czech Republic, will make his first appearance this season.
The previously undefeated Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was still at the ball yesterday with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel.
He was to be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two wins last Sunday against the club at the Alster, M<0xC3><0xA1>té Valkusz could return to the team again.
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungary, who in January 2016 was still the number one in the junior world rankings, someone from the coaching staff around Marius Zay fills the cadre.
How America can harm the OMV
Donald Trump did not seem really happy when he signed his signature under the law on Wednesday night to tighten sanctions against Russia.
“In its rush to pass the law,” he etched, Congress has packed in some “unconstitutional regulations.”
The reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected, and even Brussels was frothing against the US advance.
After all, the draft envisages punishing European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Investors of the domestic OMV, which together with other European companies co-finance the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea pipeline Nord Stream 2, have since been concerned.
The threat scene is huge.
However, it is too early to assess the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil group.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would still have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order.
There are 12 weapons to choose from.
"The press" has looked at what the group could defend and what could really hurt it.
Narcos Season 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel is in the spotlight on Netflix
Despite the second season of Narcos, which unveils Pablo Escobar’s killer, the Netflix series is far from over.
Seasons three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the first to receive its first trailer and show off the show’s latest villains.
With the third season, the DEA has turned its attention to the world’s richest drug trafficking organization: the Cali Cartel.
Led by four powerful godparents, they operate “like a Fortune 500 company” only with more state bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a, the guy who invites U.S. and Colombian law enforcement to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1.
Roll Back: The City Sets Up 46 Kitchen Aids
The city organizes the Kita lunch table again itself.
With fixed contacts for the children and an assignment to the team.
In the urban daycare centers, the clock is turned back.
On September 1, the city of Krefeld will take over the food supply in the urban daycare facilities (Kitas) again under its own direction.
For Sonja Pommeranz, deputy head of youth aid, this is good news: "We were all very happy".
Cooking continues outside the house: A caterer takes over this task and delivers freshly cooked chilled food.
The city operates 46 daycare centres in the Krefeld area, and in 44 the children receive a warm meal at lunchtime.
In the past Kitaja year, 2,800 children each sat at the tables, and the need is growing steadily.
"Meanwhile, not only do children who are cared for 45 hours a week eat in the kita at lunchtime," explains Pommeranz.
"The offer also applies to 35-hour care, if children stay until 2 p.m."
46 part-time employees have kitchen service from 1 September: they heat the delivered food, supplement it with salad, raw food and fruit, portion the meal individually, spend the food, clean, rinse and clean the kitchen.
"The employees are assigned to a kita," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-group as well as seven-group facilities - decides on the hour range.
"The kitchen assistants are now firmly part of the Kita team," says Pommeranz.
"So they are much more involved and it is easier for the kita leadership to implement pedagogical concepts".
Because that’s what it’s all about: healthy eating and cooking lessons.
"The children should help to prepare the food".
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense.
Also for the kids.
"They have a known force in the Kita, a person who is familiar with them, and not constantly changing people".
This continuity is important for the children.
In the future, the cleaning of the kita rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be carried out by special cleaning staff.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has, in addition to the quality improvement of kitchen performance, also the charm that it has proved to be the most economical for the city in terms of cost comparison between self-management and third-party procurement, the press office said.
And this, although 46 part-time forces will be reset.
"But these hours do not weigh as much in the educational sector in around 750 people," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the United Nations mission, said that hundreds of women will run in the provincial council elections. Three women run for the role of vice president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate unrestrictedly and are involved in all parts of the election process.
Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections will be held on April 5.
The Taliban have issued threats against an election process that coincide with the transition from international combat to an advisory role.
This year, for the first time, elections will be peacefully handed over power from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women will further enhance Afghanistan’s democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters are registered.

Men try to rob a 13-year-old girl
Two young men aged 19 and 23 are said to have attempted to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to police information, the 13-year-old, who was staying with friends on Kolping Street, spoke at around 2:55 p.m. because they wanted to use the girl’s cell phone.
The 13-year-old refused the request and went on with her friends.
Then one of the perpetrators tried to grab the girl’s phone and necklace, which failed.
Without prey, the duo fled.
The two men were later arrested by the police.
The investigations are ongoing.
GMB concerns about investments in the McVitie plant in Glasgow
A trade union wants to make sure managers of biscuit maker McVitie have a long-term commitment to production at their plant in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company has remained silent about the future of investments at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work in the plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits, among other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in recent years.
He added that employees and union representatives would “be the first to experience” if their activities changed.
In a letter to the company’s branch manager, GMB Scotland urged McVitie’s to “consider that funding for the modernization of production lines is not being pushed forward.”
GMB Senior Organizer Drew Duffy said, “The fact that we cannot get clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross touches our members deeply.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is strongly focused on the local community and the Greater Glasgow area, an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, from the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising cost of living and chronic production decline, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thriving production presence at McVitie.”
A Pladis spokeswoman said: “The branch manager at Tollcross has only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company will respond directly to this, as we appreciate the continued commitment of employees and union representatives.
We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago, where some issues were discussed openly.
We discussed with the employees that, like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our business – and this applies to all our business areas and locations – to remain competitive.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in our Tollcross site, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognize the legacy of Tollcross as a production site, and should our operations change at the site, employees and their union representatives will be the first to know.”
Did PSG Barcelona warn Neymar three years ago?
The La Liga side may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain won’t slow down in their pursuit of Neymar after she made an offer of <0xC2><0xA3>189 million to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago about the world record-breaking robbery?
The sensational approach has heated the transfer window this summer as the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for <0xC2><0xA3>89 million last season.
Upon completion, Neymar will become the world’s most expensive player and the world’s highest-paid professional athlete, offering wages of more than <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 per week.
Barcelona is angry at the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source close to the Catalan board insists that the club has always given its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG president against this prospect?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any club that wanted one of PSG's best players to sign.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will be in opposition to them, we will contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to have one of our players sign with them, it will have consequences.”
Barcelona seems to have crossed that line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the international from Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers to Neymar.
Roller overturned and damaged
In the night from Friday to Saturday, an unknown perpetrator deliberately overthrew a scooter parked in Königsfelder Straße in front of property number 30, thus causing more than 200 euros worth of property damage to the vehicle's cladding.
The police Schramberg, phone 07422/ 27 01-0, asks for information.
The police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese.
Because he encountered a car on his lane, the driver of a VW Touran had to evade, touching the dashboard.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum was on his way to Leese with his VW at around 19:55 on the B 215 from Stolzenau.
In the area around Stolzenau, he was met by a car on his lane, so he had to evade to the right.
The Touran driver touched the dashboard.
There was damage to the car.
The driver of the incoming car, a Mercedes Benz, had overhauled a truck and continued his drive without worrying about the traffic accident.
According to the accident victim, it may be good that the Mercedes driver did not notice the accident at all.
The police now ask witnesses of the incident and the driver of the polluter vehicle to contact the police station in Stolzenau on tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen report relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuse cases relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.
This is what author and historian Michael Hesemann says.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues to provide discussions.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are Church", told the German Press Agency that he expects from the former Bishop of Regensburg and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Domkapelllmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedict XVI.
It would be of great benefit to the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret over their own omissions or their misjudgment of the events at the time.
The Vatican newspaper Osservatore Romano, on the other hand, criticized that the reporting on violence at the cathedral spats is measured with "two measures".
Regarding the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that they are "shameful and shameful acts" that should be punished and prevented in the future; but the "degree of media manipulation" is striking, according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia, a historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee.
“The habit of calling the Catholic Church the source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider it normal,” Scaraffia writes.
Prince Gloria von Thurn and Taxis also said in an interview with the Bavarian Radio: "You like to go to church and this is a found eating".
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth, "beatings were a very normal educational means" to "get along with naughty children like me."
She found it unfair to apply today’s standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports of the abuse cases, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.
Completely wrong, says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the memoir "My Brother the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly is in the 440-page report presented by Ulrich Weber, a lawyer appointed by the Diocese of Regensburg for the Enlightenment?
A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were "with high plausibility" victims of assaults between 1945 and the early 1990s, 67 Domspatzen were sexually abused.
The final report says of Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "In summary, it can be concluded that in many cases forms of physical and mental violence were used by Domkapellemeister R.
Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more severe.
Nevertheless, unlike many other defendants, it is striking that many victims appreciated R.’s general humanity and, therefore, in many cases even associate positive memories with him despite violence.”
In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen, Georg Ratzinger, in his opinion, relieves the burden.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidences of violence against persons ordered to be protected at the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students emphasize his "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears as a cholericist and perfectionist, who often became gripping when a domspatz did not bring top performance musically.
As a biographer, how do you evaluate this final report?
Michael Hesemann: If you make the effort and read the entire 440-page report from front to back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is in it at all.
Eight pages have just been dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity in the horrific cases of sexual abuse.
The violence at the preschool also occurred outside of its sphere of action.
You can at least accuse him of learning about it too late or of not taking first hints seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium, where he worked, was perceived by virtually all respondents as - so literally - "redemption", "heaven" and "better world".
For example, the vast majority of his pupils, Georg Ratzinger, exhibits a very excellent testimony, describes him as "warmhearted", "popular", "inauthentic", "competent" and "competent", as an extremely benevolent teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes, cookies and candy stores for children.
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which has already led to outbursts of anger.
The fact that he not only cracked chairs and threw the keychain on the floor, but also spread earrings and pulled too naughty boys to his hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.
However, it must be said that such methods of education were widespread in the period in question, the 1960s and 1970s, both among parents and teachers.
Do you know any of these methods of punishment?
Of course, I think every one of us was born before 1968.
I have also experienced this in a secular school, a state high school.
Compared to what this report is actually about, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the excesses of violence in preschool, it is certainly trivial.
One wonders whether it is more to do with his fame and his role as brother of Benedict XVI, that many media just fell on him.
Many who have never understood the Bavarian pope are still working zealously.
But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every way!
A lot has been reported in the media in connection with the report on the topic of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen.
Is Georg Ratzinger also charged with any complicity or complicity with regard to sexual abuse in the final report?
Michael Hesemann: Clearly no.
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claimed to have entrusted themselves to the cathedral chapel master.
Not even the parents were inaugurated.
“I never dared to talk to my father or my mother about it,” one person told the others, “it was all very embarrassing to me.”
The real problem with the enlightenment of sexual abuse has been and still is that most victims remain silent out of shame.
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not to a choir director, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in some way.
How do the students of Domspatzen assess Ratzinger’s role in regard to abuse cases?
Michael Hesemann: A questioned student put it this way: "About sexual abuse ... I do not see ... any case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had timely findings and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.
I find it... also really absurd to assume that he has... boys have opened up more insistently or clearly or rather than to their parents, boarding school managers, trust teachers, etc.
Talking to him about sex is unthinkable.”
Thus, the report comes to the very clear result: "The fact that previously affected students and/or their environment were entrusted to him could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation".
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore to be exempt from any complicity.
Nor can he be accused of not having prevented or brought to the notice.
Therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these disgusting crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media there was much to read about "excess of violence" at the Regensburger Domspatzen.
Former Domkapelmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report "Waywatching".
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: That is the big problem, that in the reporting everything was mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and excesses of violence and somewhere, in the middle, Georg Ratzinger.
But that, in turn, is abuse of the report.
There is a clean separation between preschool and high school, between sexual abuse and excesses of violence and, let’s say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, i.e. also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir director of the Domspatzen.
All the terrible beating pedagogy, the cases in which boys were bullied and abused by sadistic teachers and suffered terribly, all took place at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
However, Domkapellemeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he only got the boys to his face when they were already in the Domspatzengymnasium.
On which, as most witnesses emphasize, the topic of "preschool" was taboo.
You were just happy to have escaped her and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.
What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was discipline, but there was no sadistic violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims appreciated R.'s general humanity and therefore in many cases even associate positive memories with him despite violence".
So at most the accusation of having looked away remains.
However, despite all efforts, the report was able to define only two periods in which it was reported on preschool conditions.
The first time in 1970/71, when he just started to establish himself and about the events at a school where he was not working and was responsible, (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then again around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close his ears before the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In it, he points out that "the whipping penalty will continue to be practiced in preschool".
Already in view of the risk of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, when beating penalties were long prohibited in Bavaria.
Before that, they took place in a legal gray zone, as we all know.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where those affected might have been exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit had actually been exceeded.
But you can’t say he’d always looked away.
That's just not true.
It was not until 1980 that the penalty for beating schools in Bavaria was officially abolished.
Prince Gloria von Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today’s pedagogical standards to those times.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the “fall trick of anachronism”, that is, the danger of assessing the past according to today’s moral standards.
The princess is right.
But this does not apply, of course, to sexual abuse, which was abhorrent at all times, nor to that which was committed in the preschool on resentments and violence against innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond the usual at the time.
It's all terrible and I'm glad it's finally being worked out.
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, i.e. earfeiging and pulling on hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then banned, he also strictly adhered to it.
What picture of his Regensburger time has Georg Ratzinger given in the conversations with you for the book "My Brother the Pope"?
Did the issue of beatings also come to the fore?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective, the Domspatzen played only a secondary role.
Nevertheless, I do not in any way conceal the fact that he led a strict regiment there.
But this must also be said: without this perfectionism, without the call for absolute discipline, it would have been hardly possible for him to form from the rather nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen an institution of world-class, true cultural ambassador of Europe and its musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988).
With cookies and sweets alone, you make reluctant boys not great singers and stand before every success, no matter what field, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.
What kind of a person did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the conversations about her book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I have really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and have experienced him again and again as a wonderful, humorous, good-natured, deeply believing and good-hearted person, of whom you cannot imagine that he could do anything to even a fly.
I regularly get to know how many former Domspatzen still today, 23 years after his emigration, keep regular contact with him, visit him, read to him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.
So those who do not forgive him until today that he was once strict with them are clearly in the minority.
Most Domspatzens today are grateful to him for enriching their lives and bringing them closer to the world of music.
And that he was always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, of course, that may be - but he was also a loving respectful person, whom they still look up to today and whom they almost worship.
And please, again, quite clearly: all that he is accused of are methods of education that were on the agenda at the time.
We can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago.
But it’s highly unfair to make a man, just because he’s prominent and has an even more prominent brother, a media scapegoat.
There is only too obvious the evil intent behind it.
Because the report just published relieves him.
Now it would be a good idea to let a 93-year-old man, who has earned great merits and without those outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany, no one would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace.
