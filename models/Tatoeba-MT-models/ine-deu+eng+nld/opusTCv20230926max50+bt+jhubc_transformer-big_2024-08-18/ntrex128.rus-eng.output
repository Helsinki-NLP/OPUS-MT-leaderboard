Members of the Assembly of Wales do not want to "go to the mappets"
Among some members of the National Assembly, there is dissatisfaction with the proposal to adopt the abbreviation MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of Parliament of Wales) for their names.
The problematic solution relates to plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly from different political parties are concerned about the possible jokes with this abbreviation.
One Labour member, expressing his party’s opinion, expressed concern that the new abbreviation “refutes Twp and Pwp”.
For our readers not from Wales: in Welsh twp means "stupid", and pwp - "duck".
According to a member of the Assembly from the Wales Party, his organization as a whole was “dissatisfied” and offered other options.
Representatives of the conservative party “do not object” to the new abbreviation, but note that MWP is close by writing to the word Muppet (mappet).
In this context, the letter w in Welsh is pronounced roughly like the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Committee of the Assembly, currently drafting a bill to change the name, made the following statement: “The final decision on the name of the Members of the Assembly will, of course, remain with them.”
Under the Wales Governance Act of 2017, the National Assembly of Wales is authorized to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public opinion poll on the proposed options, according to which the option of “Welsh Parliament” instead of “Assembly” found broad support among the local population.
As for the names of the members of the Assembly, the Committee preferred the Welsh Parliament Members (WMP) option, while the MWP option received the greatest public support.
It seems that the members of the Assembly are proposing other options, but it will not be easy for the Chairman, Elina Jones, to find a solution that fits all. We will remind you that the draft law on amendments should be submitted in a few weeks.
Reform laws will include other modifications to the Assembly ' s working process, including new rules on disqualification of members of the Assembly and the structure of the Committee ' s system.
The members of the Assembly will vote in favour of the final version of their name during the debate on the draft law.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum on changing the name of their country
On Sunday, Macedonians will vote to rename the country “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The popular vote is intended to resolve a long-standing dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia.
The Greek government has long insisted that the name “Republic of Macedonia” implies territorial claims against the Greek province, and has repeatedly opposed the accession of its northern neighbor to the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on changing the name, said he was not going to recognize its results.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, note that the change of the country's name is only the price of joining the EU and NATO.
The crisis in the Harlem parishes: the bells of St. Martin are forever silent
“The elders in the area I was talking to said that before, there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams says.
“There is no one left now.”
The disappearance of the bars can still be understood:
“The format of communication has changed.”
“The bar ceased to be a kind of living room of the entire district, where they came regularly.”
But as for the churches, it is worrying that the funds received from the sale of assets will be enough for a short time, no matter what their leaders hope. “Sooner or later they will be left with nothing.”
On the site of the church, he added, there will be a multi-apartment house, whose residents are unlikely to support the parishes preserved in the area.
“Most of the buyers of these apartments will be white,” Adams says, “and that will bring the day when such churches will finally close down because new neighbors will never become their parishioners.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black district: the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and the Church of St. Martin – 10 years later.
The first parishioners of the Methodist church left the parish in the 30s of the last century.
Their building was bought by a black parish, located next door.
When the church of St. Martin passed into the hands of the black community, it was headed by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who organized a boycott of shops on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping arcade, where blacks refused to take up employment or to serve.
In 1939, as a result of a fire, the building was significantly damaged, and during the restoration work, the parishioners of Johnson's father ordered the installation of a carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Johnson’s father, who replaced him as head of the Church of St. Martin, proudly called the carillon “the bells for the poor.”
But the expert who tested the carillon in July called it another way: “cultural heritage” and “a unique historical instrument”.
Tiffani Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that the St. Martin's church carillon was the world's first instrument of its kind, played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind. 18 years ago, he was invited to play at the larger carillon in the Riverside church.
According to Merriweather, the church of St. Martin has not yet found a replacement for him.
The last few months around the church of St. Martin, there has been a difficult situation with architects and contractors, some of whom have been invited by the secular leaders of the church, others by the diocese of the Episcopal Church.
The parish assembly, the governing body of the parish, which includes secular leaders, in July addressed the diocese, expressing concern that the diocese "will try to shift the cost of works" to the parish meeting, although the latter had nothing to do with the choice of architects and contractors sent to the eparchy.
Some parishioners expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
In California, a shark injured a 13-year-old diver who was involved in lobster mining
According to official sources, on Saturday, the first day of the lobster hunting season, a 13-year-old diver in California was attacked by a shark and received body damage.
The attack took place around 7 a.m. near the beach of Bacon Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told in an interview with KSWB-TV (San Diego), on Saturday morning he dived with his friends and about half an hour later heard the boy screaming for help. Together with his friends they sailed on the boat to the site of the attack and pulled the teenager out.
According to Hammel, at first he decided that the boy was loudly happy to catch the lobster, but quickly "understood that he was shouting "I've been bitten!
They bite me!”
Swim to the diver, Hammel noticed that "he had completely torn the skin around the keychain."
“I screamed for everyone to get out of the water: ‘Here’s a shark!’” says Hammel.
The boy was delivered by helicopter to Reddy Children's Hospital (San Diego); his condition is assessed as critical.
The type of shark that attacked a teenager is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, told a press briefing that a shark had been spotted at the site a few weeks ago, but it had not been referred to as a dangerous species.
Giles also added that the victim of the attack was injured in the upper part of the torso.
Officials blocked the area from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami Beach in Encinitas for 48 hours to conduct an investigation and ensure the safety of the population.
Giles noted that there are 135 species of sharks in this area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to conquer the UK's perfume and cosmetics market
Sainsbury is going to establish departments of cosmetics and perfumery in the stores of Buttes, Superdrag and Debenhams with consultants-cosmetologists, according to the model of luxury department stores.
The UK perfume and cosmetics market is estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continues to expand, while in the field of fashion and home goods sales are falling. To capture a significant share of this desired market as an experiment in many stores and stores across the country, they will be represented by large departments of cosmetology
Supermarket owners are looking to fill the shelves previously used for televisions, microwaves, home goods, and investments in the perfume and cosmetics market are a good solution.
According to representatives of Sainsbury’s, it is planned to double the range of cosmetic products to 3,000 names; including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw will be offered for the first time.
The existing range from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will be presented on a larger scale, in specially designated locations, by the type of organization of goods in the boutiques.
In addition, the branded line of products “Shop-cosmetics” will be reorganized with the transition to vegan products to meet the demands of young buyers.
The two stores in Sainsbury’s will feature kiosks from perfume makers Fragrance Shop: the first one already opened in Croydon in south London last week, and the second one is expected to open in Celly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
E-commerce and the tendency to buy a small amount of food every day in small shops near the house have led to supermarkets being forced to attract buyers in other ways.
Mike Coop, president of Sainsbury's, says outlets will gradually turn into department stores, and his supermarket network is battling buyers in a competitive battle with cheap stores like Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and non-food goods.
Hundreds of supermarkets in Sainsbury’s host Argos outlets, and in some of them you can now find Habitats stores since the network acquired both brands two years ago. This has led to an increase in food sales and revenues from these acquisitions.
Previous attempts of the supermarket to give a new life to its cosmetics and pharmacy departments were not successful.
In the early 2000s, a joint venture between Sainsbury and Booths was organized, but in the future there were disagreements between the participants on the division of income from the sale of pharmacy products in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after the sale of Sainsbury’s pharmaceutical business (a total of 281 stores) to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy network, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years earlier.
Lloyds is expected to provide support in the implementation of the plan by adding a wide range of luxury skincare products La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have completely transformed the look and feel of our perfume and cosmetics departments to create a more conducive environment for our customers.
We have also invited specially trained consultants who will always be ready to help with the advice.
Our range of brands for every taste, pleasant design and convenient location of stores will attract many visitors in search of cosmetics and perfumery. This will be a completely new concept of shopping tours. "
Peter Jones reacted “angryly” to Holly Willoughby’s withdrawal from the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
The star of the show “Dragon Log” Peter Jones “angry” with the exit of TV host Holly Willowie from the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal, which she was supposed to make with the lifestyle brand Peter, but instead preferred new contracts with “Marks and Sparks”
Willoughby doesn’t have time for their joint brand of Truly homewear and accessories.
The business of this couple was compared with the brand Goop actress Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old program leader “This Morning” announced her decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby's decision to leave their lucrative lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marx and Spencer and ITV has angered Peter Jones, the star of The Dragon's Legacy.
According to our sources, Jones was "angry" when a favorite of viewers during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that after concluding new contracts worth up to 1.5 million bucks, she will not have enough time for them.
Their brand was compared to the child of actress Gwyneth Paltrow brand Goop, and it was expected that its sales would double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
The 37-year-old announced her departure on Instagram, and Jones himself left the UK on a private plane to one of his villas.
According to one source, “Truly’s brand was Holly’s top priority.
It was a long-term investment that would ensure its carefree existence for the next couple of decades.
Its decision led to the stupor of all participants in the transaction.
Everyone was stunned by what happened on Tuesday, because there were only a few weeks left before the launch of the brand.
At the Marlowe headquarters, there was a whole warehouse filled with ready-to-sell goods.”
Experts believe that the departure of the leading "This Morning", one of the most popular stars in the UK, can cost the firm millions of pounds because of significant investments in goods, from pillows and candles to clothes, as well as a potential delay in the launch of the line.
In addition, we are talking about the breakup of long-standing friendly relations.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Willowby created the Truly brand together with Tara Capp in 2016, and Tara’s husband, 52-year-old Peter Jones, headed the company’s board in March.
Both couples often spend vacations together, and in addition, Jones owns 40% of Dan Baldwin’s TV production company.
Willowby will become M&S's ambassador and replace Anthony McPartlin in the lead role on ITV's "I'm a Celebrity."
A source close to Jones said last night: “We can’t comment on his commercial affairs.”
Difficult Negotiations, “And Then We Loved Each Other”
He joked about the criticism that the media will come up against him because of the “unworthy president” comment and the positive assessment of the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so many claims?
Trump said, imitating the voice of the news host.
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He noted that Kim Jong-un was interested in a reunion after Trump called their first summit held in Singapore in June a significant step towards reducing nuclear stockpiles in North Korea.
Negotiations on denuclearization have stalled.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, high-ranking North Korean diplomat Li Yong Ho addressed world leaders at a meeting of the UN General Assembly on Saturday with a statement that North Korea is still waiting for “appropriate responses” from the US after the first meeting.
Instead, the U.S., the diplomat noted, continues to use sanctions as a lever of pressure.
During the meeting of his supporters, President Trump expressed a much more optimistic assessment.
“The situation with North Korea is great,” he said.
“We were on the brink of war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have died.
We have a great relationship now.”
According to Trump, his efforts to establish relations with Kim Jong-un have borne fruit: missile tests have been put to an end, hostages have been released, and U.S. troops remaining in the DPRK have also returned to their homeland.
Speaking about his relationship with Kim Jong-un, Trump stressed that there is nothing strange about his unusual approach to diplomacy.
“Behaving like the president is so easy, but then instead of 10,000 people on the street rushing into this completely crowded hall, there would be only 200 people here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd gathered in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: recorded catastrophic destruction, victims are counted in the hundreds
In the first days after the earthquake that hit Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that there was no need for their help.
Despite the fact that more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had lost their roof over their heads, the Government did not consider it necessary to declare a national natural disaster, which was a mandatory condition for international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have clearly made it clear that they do not need international support, so it was not easy,” says Selina Sambung.
The organization “Save the Children” is preparing a team to send to Palu, but we do not know yet if the foreign group will be able to work on the site.
According to Mr. Sutopo, the official representative of the National Office for the Elimination of Natural Disasters, the Indonesian leadership is conducting an assessment of the situation in Palu to determine whether it is appropriate to involve international organizations.
In view of the ongoing seismic instability in Indonesia, the country remains appallingly ill-prepared for natural disasters.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, they are rarely found on other coastlines.
Despite the tsunami warning, a siren was not included in Palu to alert the population, which is likely to have resulted in so many casualties.
The transport communication between the numerous Indonesian islands is quite problematic even in good weather.
Natural disasters are making logistics even more difficult.
A floating hospital, previously docked in Lombok to assist earthquake victims, is headed to Palu, but the road to the site of the new disaster will take at least three days.
President Joko Widodo has made the strengthening of Indonesia’s outdated infrastructure the focal point of his election campaign and has spent countless dollars on improving roads and railways.
However, the administration of President Joko, running for a new term next year, has plunged into funding problems.
The president is also criticized for escalating interfaith hostility between Indonesia’s conservative Muslim majority and the rest of the population.
Thousands more were killed and tens of thousands more lost their homes as a result of clashes between Christians and Muslims armed with machetes, bows with arrows and other machine guns.
Video: Liverpool player Daniel Starridge compares the score in the match against Chelsea with a goal in the far top corner of the goal
Daniel Starridge saved Liverpool from defeat in the 89th minute of the Premier League match against Chelsea, held on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium.
Starridge received a pass from Jerdan Shakiri about 27 meters from the Chelsea goal when his team lost 1-0.
He moved to the left and broke into the far corner of the gate.
The ball flew high and was in the far upper corner of the net.
Golkiper Kepa Arrisabalag jumped in the direction of the ball, but it was already too late.
In an interview with LiverpoolFC.com, Starridge said: “The whole point was to be in this position and get the ball, players like Shak always play the maximum attack, so I just wanted to give myself as much time as possible.”
“I saw that Kante was coming to me, took the ball and, thinking for a short time, broke through the gate.”
At the end of the first half of the match, the Chelsea team led with a score of 1-0, the goal in the 25th minute was scored by the Belgian Eden Azar.
The central striker of Chelsea, passing the pass back to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87>, broke through the middle of the field to the half of Liverpool.
In the middle of the field Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> played one touch.
Then he gave the pass to Azar, who went out to the gate.
Azar overtook the defence and struck Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker from the left flank, striking the far corner of the grid.
"Liverpool" will meet with the team "Napoli" in the group stage of the Champions League. The match will take place at the stadium "San Paolo" in Naples (Italy) on Wednesday at 15:00.
Chelsea will play with Videoton in the UEFA Euroleague match, which will be held on Thursday in London, also at 15:00.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami has increased to 832 people
The death toll from the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami in Indonesia has reached 832, the National Disaster Reduction Authority said on Sunday morning.
According to reports, under the ruins of buildings destroyed as a result of an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 on the Richter scale, there are many people left. The earthquake occurred on Friday and caused tsunamis with waves up to 6 meters high, reported Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
The city of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000 people, was toppled by debris from collapsed houses.

Monument to Cromwell in front of the parliament building sparked a fierce discussion about "rewriting history"
Cromwell’s “expulsion” would be a deserved retaliation for the barbaric destruction of England’s numerous cultural and religious artifacts by his followers, Puritan fanatics.
However, the Cromwell Memorial Society called Mr. Crick’s proposal “insanity” and an “attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Memorial Society, said: “As part of the ongoing debate over the demolition of historic monuments, the question of the statue of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Westminster Palace inevitably arose.
Cromwell has nothing to do with the iconoclastic movement during the English Civil Wars.
Oliver Cromwell probably suffers for the sins of his ancestor, Thomas, who lived a century earlier.
The magnificent statue of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Tornicroft reflects the opinion of his contemporaries in the 19th century and the historical achievements of a man whom many still consider worthy of respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, John Goldsmith said: “Many people, especially in the late 19th century, considered Cromwell to be a protector of parliament from external pressure, in his case, a monarchy.
Whether such an opinion can be considered historically accurate remains a subject of debate by experts.
But we can confidently say that the conflict that arose in the middle of the 17th century influenced the subsequent development of our country, and Cromwell was a significant historical figure representing one side of this section.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of high esteem and respect.”
Chinese farmer dies after being bitten by a murderous pig
In one of the markets of southwestern China, the farmer became a victim of a pig, local media reports.
The victim's body (the media only mentions his surname, "Yuan") with a ruptured artery was found near a cage in a market in Lupanshui County, Guizhou Province, southern China. This was reported by the Morning Post newspaper on Sunday.
The pig farm is preparing to introduce vaccinations to pigs on a pig farm, on May 30, 2005, in Xinin County, Qinghai Province, China.
Yuan and his cousin arrived from nearby Yunnan province on Wednesday and brought 15 pigs for sale.
The next morning, a cousin found Yuan’s breathless body, and the door to the neighboring piggy bank was opened.
There was a huge tick in the piggy bank with blood on its cheek.
During the forensic examination, it was found that a pig weighing 250 kilograms bit the farmer to death.
“My brother’s legs were bloodied and mutilated,” said Guiyang Evening News Wu, a relative of the man.
A video from the surveillance cameras showed that Yuan came to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his animals.
The body was found about an hour later.
The killer pig did not belong to the brothers.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was isolated in a separate unit for the time of the investigation, in order to avoid repeated attacks.
Yuan's family is reportedly in talks with the market administration about compensation for the farmer's death.
Cases of swine attacks on humans are rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in the U.S. state of Massachusetts, severely traumatizing a man.
Ten years ago, a 300-kilogram animal nailed a Welsh farmer to a tractor and let go, only to be afraid of his estranged wife.
In 2012, there was a case where a farmer from the state of Oregon in the US was eaten by his own pigs. As one Canadian farmer told CBC News, pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act on their hidden aggression as a “trigger mechanism.”
"Pigs are playful,
They are biting and very curious, but they have no purpose to offend you.
You just have to give your animals a sense of measure and respect,” he explained.
Hurricane Rosa Will Bring Rains to Much of the Southwestern United States
According to the forecast, Hurricane Rosa is losing strength as it moves through a cooler water zone to the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the next few days it will bring rains and floods to the territory of northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
As of Saturday, 5 a.m. in New York City, the cyclone reached Category 1 with winds of up to 135 km/h, located 360 km southwest of the city of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The storm is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low-pressure zone is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean, which will move east to the west coast of the United States. Approaching the coast of the state of Lower California, the storm will bring tropical humidity north of Mexico, to the territory of the southwestern United States.
More than 25 cm of rainfall is expected in Mexico on Monday.
Under the influence of tropical humidity, which has fallen into the emerging low-pressure zone, heavy rainfall is expected in the coming days in the South-West.
Precipitation from 2.5 to 10 cm will cause dangerous rainfall floods, mudstone flows and possible landslides in the desert.
In some areas, especially in the southern states of Nevada and Arizona, due to high tropical humidity, precipitation rates can reach 5 to 8 cm per hour.
In some parts of the southwestern United States, mainly in most of Arizona, up to 5-10 cm of precipitation is expected.
The risk of sudden rapidly developing floods due to the uneven distribution of tropical rains is not excluded.
With the existing risk of tropical showers, walking in the desert is fraught with serious consequences.
Livonias can turn canyons into turbulent rivers, and thunder can cause turbulent winds and lift clouds of dust.
With the emergence of a low-pressure zone, places on the coast of southern California will be flooded with rain.
It is possible to fall up to 1.5 cm of precipitation, which can cause small mudstone flows and create slippery surfaces on roads.
This is the first rainfall since the beginning of the rainy season in the region.
On Sunday evenings and Monday mornings in Arizona, tropical rains will spread to other areas by the evening of Monday and Tuesday morning.
By Tuesday, the showers will take place in the Four Corners area and will last until Wednesday evening.
In October, sharp temperature changes will be observed throughout the United States, due to the low air temperature in the Arctic with sufficiently high temperatures in the tropics.
Sometimes this combination leads to strong temperature variations in a small area.
Such sharp temperature changes will be particularly noticeable in the central U.S. on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska) and between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa) is nearly 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the summer heat will accumulate and spread to other territories.
In most of the central and eastern U.S. territories, warm weather is expected in early October, temperatures will reach 27 degrees in the space from the Southern Plains to the Northeast of the country.
In New York on Tuesday, the air temperature may rise to 27 degrees, which is 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast promises an unusually high temperature on the U.S. east coast by mid-October.
The Senate hearings in the case of Judge Brett Kavanaugh watched more than 20 million spectators
The testimony of Brett Kavanaugh and Christina Blazy Ford, who accused Kavanaugh of attempted rape in the 1980s, drew the attention of more than 20 million viewers on six television channels on Thursday.
The political opposition around Kavanaugh’s candidacy has received an unexpected continuation. On Friday, an urgent message was sent to the media: Republican Jeff Fleck put forward a condition that the charges against the lawyer be investigated by the FBI within a week.
Ford said at a hearing before the Senate Legal Committee that she was “100 percent” sure that Kavanaugh had intoxicated her and tried to undress her at a school party.
Kavanaugh gave emotional testimony, saying he was 100 percent sure it didn’t happen.
According to research agency Nielsen, the Friday debate was watched by more than 20.4 million spectators.
The agency took into account the average data from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
Audience figures for other channels, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, are not yet available.
In addition, the Nielsen rating does not always take into account viewers watching TV at work.
For comparison: this is an average audience watching a game of American football in the playoffs or the Oscars ceremony.
The largest audience was the Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment: the Senate hearings, which lasted all day, watched an average of 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen reported.
In second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS audience was 3.1 million, NBC — 2.94 million, MSNBC watched 2.89 million viewers, while CNN had 2.52 million views, reports Nielsen.
After the hearing, interest in the case did not weaken.
On Friday, there was a real drama with the participation of Jeff Fleck.
After a senator from Arizona, considered a moderate Republican, announced his intention to support Kavanaugh's candidacy, CNN and CBS managed to shoot on camera as on Friday morning on the way to a meeting of the Legal Committee, Flake met in the lyftek.
The whole world has seen him, looking down, getting a buzz from angry women live on CNN.
“I’m standing in front of you,” one of them said.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
“You have power, while so many women are powerless,” the women tried to explain their position.
Fleck told the activists that his office had already prepared a statement and he would speak at the committee meeting. The elevator doors closed, hiding the senator from the ubiquitous cameras.
When, a few hours later, the Legal Committee was preparing to approve Kavanaugh’s candidacy for the post of judge and send it to the Senate for a general vote, all the channels broadcast the meeting live.
Fleck, however, made one condition: an FBI investigation into the charges against the candidate by next week, as the democratic minority sought.
Fleck claims to have changed his mind thanks to the intervention of a friend, Senator from the Democrats Chris Kuns.
He made the final decision by talking to Kuns and several other senators.
Fleck’s decision was effective, as it was clear that the Republicans lacked the votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
By President Trump’s decree, the FBI opened an investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses her critics of “political games” around the Brexit situation
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians criticizing her plan to leave the European Union of putting narrow-party interests above the interests of society.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, published on one of May’s interviews, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson criticized her so-called “Shashka” plan within Brexit, saying that he considers the introduction of customs duties between the UK and the EU “absolutely ridiculous.”
Death of Wade Sims in Shooting: Police Arrest Dayteon Simpson on Suspected Murder of Louisiana State University Forward
Police have arrested a man suspected of killing Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who played for Louisiana State University.
Baton Rouge police said 20-year-old Dayteon Simpson was arrested and placed in custody on charges of second-degree murder.
Police have released a video of a fight involving Sims and Simpson, in which Sims lost his points.
According to the WAFB, a regional CBS channel, the police found Simpson's DNA on glasses found at the scene of the crime.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted that he had fatally wounded Wade.
According to the magazine Advocate, a pledge of $350,000 has been made for Simpson.
The coroner of the eastern Baton Rouge district on Friday published a preliminary finding that the death was caused by a combined gunshot wound to the neck and head.
The department is grateful to the Louisiana State Police Criminal Investigation Department, the State Police Forensics Laboratory, the Southern University Police, and local residents for assisting in the search operations that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, director of sports at the University of Louisiana, thanked law enforcement for their “good faith work on catching a criminal.”
Sims was only 20 years old.
The two-meter forward was a native of Baton Rouge; his father Wayne also played on the Louisiana State University team.
Last season, Sims scored 5.6 points and averaged 2.6 rebounds per game.
Team coach Will Wade made a statement on Friday morning, saying Wade Sims' tragic death caused "shock" and "real grief" for all players.
“That’s what I’ve always been afraid of,” added the coach.
Volcano covered with ash Mexico
Volcano Popokatepetl filled the southern vicinity of the Mexican capital with ashes.
On Saturday, the National Center for Natural Disaster Prevention of Mexico recommended the population not to approach the volcano: activity was recorded in its crater and 183 gas emissions were produced in a day.
According to the Center, near the volcano there was often a thunderstorm and tremors felt.
In some areas of Mexico City, such as Sochi, social media users have posted photos of windshields of cars covered in a thin layer of ash.
After an earthquake of 7.1 Mw, which shook the central part of Mexico in September 2017, geophysicists recorded the involved volcanic activity 72 km southeast of the capital.
Popokatepetl Volcano (or, for its own, "Don Goyo") is an active volcano since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists on the eve of the first anniversary of the independence referendum
On Saturday, a multi-thousand rally was held in Barcelona, dedicated to the first anniversary of the referendum on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain, which split the country into two camps. It was not without clashes between supporters of independence autonomy and police; six participants in the riots fell.
Police officers pushed back protesters who supported independence, while the latter, dressed in black masks, threw guards with eggs and powder paint, lifting clouds of dark dust in the center of Barcelona.
After the police launched a stick to deter the mob, the riots resumed with new force.
For several hours, supporters of independence chanted: “Let’s not forget, let’s not forgive!”, and their opponents responded with the slogan: “Long live Spain!”.
According to local media reports, fourteen participants of the action were hospitalized with minor injuries.
On 1 October last year, a referendum was held on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain. It was recognized by the Spanish government as illegal, but it became an important milestone for the separatists. A year later, tensions persist in the region striving for sovereignty.
Catalonia voted overwhelmingly to leave Spain, but the turnout was low because opponents of the exit largely boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan official sources, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to block a referendum in the country’s polling stations in fierce clashes.
On Friday, the separatists spent the night on the declared path of following the demonstration in support of the Spanish police to prevent it from taking place.
The demonstration took place anyway, but took a different route.
68-year-old electrician Narcissus Termes, who attended a rally of separatists in the company of his wife, revels in the fact that the hope of Catalonia's acquisition of sovereignty is becoming increasingly fragile.
“Last year, one of the most important events in our lives happened.
My parents were crying with happiness, having the opportunity to vote in a referendum, and today we are in a suspended state,” he says.
In the recent elections in December to the local governing bodies, Catalan parties in favour of secession from Spain have won an important victory, albeit with a small margin. However, this year their movement loses supporters, as many of the well-known leaders of the movement are either on the run or under detention, awaiting trial for their role.
Hoan Puch, a 42-year-old mechanic who is recording a rally on the phone in support of police, said the conflict is heating up on both sides of the political spectrum.
“Tension is rising,” he added.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan separatist leaders since late last year in pre-trial detention, announced his intention to run for the European Parliament next year.
"Participation in the next elections to the European Parliament as a candidate is the best way to condemn the loss of democratic values and repression on the part of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: car crashed into the house, all three accomplices arrested
One of the houses in Londonberry was hit by a car several times; men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested.
The raid was made on Thursday at around 19:30 local time in the Ballinagard Crescent area.
As a result, the gate and the building itself were damaged, according to Bob Blemmings, a police inspector.
There are reports that the car may have been shot from an onion.
Livingstone's victory over Rangers thanks to Mengi's goal
Dolly Mengi's first goal brought a guaranteed victory to the team of Livingston
Thanks to the batted ball, Livingston won an unexpected victory over the Rangers. For the head coach of the Scottish club, Stephen Gerrard, this is only the second defeat in 18 games.
Dolly Mengi's exact shot equated Gary Holt's team with the Hibernian in the scoreboard, where they share second place.
Gerrard's club has been left without a win at the departure this season of the Premier League. On Sunday they will meet with the leaders of the group, the "Harts", from which the "Rangers" are behind by eight points.
On Thursday, the Rangers will host a Europa League match against Austrian club Rapid (Vienna) on their field.
The club continues its win-win series in the division, having already played six games and not received a single defeat since Holt replaced Kenny Miller as the team's head coach.
Missed moments for "Livingston" in the fight with insistent guests
Holt’s coaches had to keep track from the start – the Rangers clearly couldn’t handle their pressure.
Scott Robinson managed to break through the line of defense, but the goal from his weak attempt did not come out. Then the defender Alan Litgow, swinging too wide, could not prevent the ball of Keigh Halkett to get into the net.
The receiving side allowed the Rangers to play in front of their line of defense, counting on dangerous moments when the game resumes.
That’s how they missed this important goal.
The Rangers conceded a free kick, and Livingston took advantage of the opportunity: Declan Gallagher and Robinson made the transfer to Menge, who scored from the central position.
By that time, the Rangers were superior in possession of the ball, but the defense of the host team was unbreakable, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not concerned.
The second half continued on the same schedule, although Kelly still had to strike back from Alfredo Morelos.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor kicked off the ball from Scott Pittman, and Litgou made a wide feed from the standard position.
The balls were constantly caught in the penalty shoot-out, but all the attacks were reflected, and two penalty demands — one for provoking backup player Glenn Middleton Halkett and the other for playing hand — were not met.
"Phenomenal" game "Livingston" - analysis
From BBC Scotland — Alasdair Lamont, reportage from the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal game and a great result for the team of Livingston.
Absolutely all the players were great and once again exceeded all expectations, continuing their ascent to the football Olympia.
Their style of play and composition has hardly changed since they climbed to the top of the rankings, and the great merit of Holt's coach is that he mobilized this team from the very beginning.
There were a lot of real heroes on his team.
Captain Halkett led the superbly organized defense, and Menga did not let Connor Goldson and Joe Warall relax.
At the same time, the Rangers could not enter the rhythm.
“Although they had a good game with coach Gerrard, this time they didn’t live up to our expectations.
In the last minutes of the match they lacked possession of the ball, and they managed to pass the defense of the host team only once. The Rangers, who fell into the middle of the table, has something to think about.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an's cool reception during a visit to Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast, the weather was fine, and the two leaders were in a great mood.
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s visit to Germany in order to establish relations between the two NATO countries – a visit already associated with some conflicts.
The heads of state failed to find an understanding on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
After Erdogan went to Cologne to take part in the opening ceremony of a huge new mosque.
Cologne is home to the largest Turkish diaspora outside of Turkey.
For security reasons, the police did not allow the 25,000-strong crowd to enter the mosque, but many supporters of Erdogan were nearby to see their president.
In the same place, opponents of the Erdogan regime, including the Kurds, gathered to condemn in full voice both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to invite him to visit Germany.
The presence of radically opposite views at the meeting reflects the ambiguous essence of this figure: many Germans with Turkish roots exalt Erdogan, while others consider him a tyrant.
Deptford road accident: collision with a car led to the death of a cyclist
In London, the car collided with a cyclist who died at the scene of the accident.
The accident occurred near Bethwood Street and Evelyn Street, a bustling intersection in the southeastern part of the city of Depfort, at about 10:15 a.m. local time.
The driver of the car and the sanitators who arrived at the place tried to help the cyclist, but the man died without coming to consciousness.
This is not the only fatal accident in the area: just one and a half kilometers from the site of the accident, on Childers Street, another cyclist was shot down by a car whose driver escaped.
The London police report that work is currently underway to identify the deceased and inform his immediate relatives.
At the time of the incident, roads were closed and the bus route changed: drivers were asked not to enter the area.
Long-Lartin Jail Riots: Six Policemen Wounded
According to the Long-Latin administration, six policemen were injured in the riots in the male prison of the strict regime.
In the men's prison of the strict regime Long-Latin (Wustershire) from Sunday continues the riots, which are tied around 09:30 local time.
To suppress the riots, in which eight prisoners from one wing were involved, was called the "Tornado" opera group.
The police received minor damage to the soft tissues of the face; they were provided with medical care on the spot.
According to the prison’s official, “specially trained staff have been involved in resolving the incident at the Long-Lartin Correctional Facility.
Six of them were injured.
We strongly condemn the use of physical force in our institution, and it is clear that the culprits will be handed over to the police and their measure of restraint can be changed for a longer period of time.”
There are currently more than 500 prisoners in Long Lartina, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the media reported that the prison manager was rushed to the hospital after being attacked by one of the inmates.
And in October of last year, the prison leadership was forced to bring in special purpose units to reassure swarming inmates who threw billiard balls at the guards.
Hurricane Rosa could flood Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (which would benefit arid areas)
Arizona rarely gets into the zone of passage of an intense tropical cyclone, but this time she is “lucky”: early next week, Hurricane Rosa, having made the last burst, must pass over the desert part of the South-West and bring with it the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already warned of the threat of flooding on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and southern and eastern Nevada, in southeastern California and Utah, including in cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to pass in a straight line over Phoenix on Tuesday and rain on Monday night.
The Bureau of the National Meteorological Service in Phoenix said on Twitter that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of a tropical storm or depression, being within a radius of 320 km from Phoenix, since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) passed 65 km from the Arizona border.
According to the latest forecasts of the National Meteorological Service, there will be from 5 to 10 cm of precipitation, sometimes reaching 15 cm on the Arizonan plateau of Mogul-Rome.
In other desert regions of the Southwest, such as the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it is possible to fall up to 2.5-5 cm of precipitation, places of precipitation can reach 10 cm.
For areas whose rainfall flows will bypass the side, the rain brought by Hurricane Rose can be a real blessing, because the region has long suffered from drought.
Although flooding can be dangerous, heavy rains can ease the dry season that is not taking place in the Southwestern United States.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor maps, more than 40 percent of Arizona’s territory is experiencing at least a severe drought (the second-heavyest category),” reports the website weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa will hit the Mexican state of Lower California.
As of Sunday morning, the hurricane, which has a maximum speed of 137 km/h, is 360 km south of the city of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and is moving north at a speed of 19 km/h.
The hurricane is in a zone with cooler water on the Pacific coast and thus loses its strength.
In the afternoon, the hurricane will reach Mexico in the category of "tropical storm".
Extensive flooding is expected in some areas of Mexico.
“In the territory from Lower California to the northwest of Sonora, up to 7-10 cm of precipitation can fall, in places up to 25 cm,” reports the website weather.com.
Then Hurricane Rosa will head north through Mexico and early in the morning on Tuesday will reach the border with Arizona in the category of tropical cyclone. From Arizona it will reach the southern part of the state of Utah by the evening of Tuesday.
“The main potential risk associated with Hurricane Rose and its remnants is associated with heavy rainfall in Lower California, the northwestern part of Sonora and the desert areas of the southwestern United States,” the National Weather Service said in a statement.
Precipitation is expected to cause dangerous flooding, mudslides in the desert and possible landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsummer Norton Attack: Four Suspects Arrested for Attempted Murder
In Somerset, a 16-year-old teenager was seriously stabbed and three teenagers and a 20-year-old boy were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The victim of the shooting with serious injuries was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsummer Norton about 4 a.m. on Saturday.
After hospitalization, his condition is assessed as “stable”.
Four suspects, aged 17, 18 and 20, were arrested in the Radstock area on the same night, Avon and Somerset County Police said.
The police are looking for possible witnesses of the crime, possessing any videos of what happened on a mobile phone.
Donald Trump: “All the hatred, all the anger of the Democrats has fallen on Kavanaugh”
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and outrageous tactics used by Democrats,” Trump said at a rally in Willing, West Virginia.
According to Trump, in the process of approving the nomination of Kavanaugh for the candidate, “all hatred, all anger” of the Democratic Party has fallen.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified in the U.S. Congress, in his emotional address categorically rejecting Christina Blazy Ford’s accusation that he sexually harassed her more than 30 years ago when they were both teenagers.
Dr. Ford also testified during the hearing on her charge.
On Saturday, the U.S. president said that on that day, “the American people saw a brilliant mind, class and courage” Kavanaugh.
“The vote for the approval of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the approval of one of the most outstanding lawyers of our time, with an untainted state record,” the president told a crowd of his associates in West Virginia.
In his speech, the President touched indirectly on the issue of Kavanaugh’s nomination, talking about the importance of the Republicans’ presence in the elections to Congress and the House of Representatives.
“There are only five weeks left before the most important elections in our lives.
I don’t participate in them, but I participate in the race in a different sense,” he said.
“I’m wearing it like a burnt-out and fighting for our excellent candidates.”
Trump says the Democrats have set themselves the task of “resisting us with all their might.”
According to the rules, the first key vote in the Senate to approve Kavanaugh's candidacy should take place no later than Friday, an assistant to a high-ranking representative of the Republican Party said.
Earthquake in Indonesia has claimed hundreds of lives, and the total number of victims continues to grow
On Saturday, Indonesian authorities announced that at least 384 people had died, many of them carried away by giant waves, capturing the beaches of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, which was hit by an incredible tsunami and earthquake.
The first victims of the element were hundreds of guests of the beach festival in the city of Palu. On Friday, at sunset, waves almost six meters high reached the coast, which dared everything in their path and led to the instant death of many of those present.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 on the Richter scale.
“When the storm warning was announced yesterday, people continued their beach break, instead of immediately fleeing to shelter, and because of this lost their lives,” said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, an official representative of the Indonesian National Department of Liquidation.
“The tsunami did not come one thing, in the flow of water there were cars, moorings, entire houses, the element destroyed everything in its path,” Nugroho explained, adding that the tsunami crossed the ocean at a speed of 497 km / h and crashed with all its force on the coast.
Some of those present climbed the trees, which saved their lives.
Some 16,700 local residents were evacuated to 24 shelters in Palu.
An aerial photograph of the disaster management shows destroyed houses, shops, collapsed bridges and a flooded mosque.
On Saturday, the coastal city was still shaken by an underground quake.
A series of earthquakes occurred in the territory with a population of 2.4 million people.
The Agency for the Evaluation and Use of Technology of the Republic of Indonesia (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy emissions caused by the earthquake were about 200 times greater than those caused by the explosion of the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.
Perhaps the tsunami was stronger than expected, due to the geographical location of the city, located at the end of a long narrow bay.
Nugroho called the damage “scaling,” adding that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been destroyed.
Under the ruins of the collapsed buildings, the bodies of the dead were found; 540 people were injured in all, and 29 are still missing.
Nugroho added that the casualties and destruction could be even more significant along the coast 300 km from Palu, in the town of Dongala, which was closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Communications from the Dongala were “completely destroyed, no information was received.”
“There are more than 300,000 people living in the Dongala area,” said the International Committee of the Red Cross, whose staff and volunteers have already gone to the disaster zone.
“There has been a tragedy, but it is not the limit,” the statement said.
On Saturday, the Office was harshly criticized for failing to report the arrival of the tsunami in Palu in time. Authorities, however, believe that the waves reached the coast at a time when the initial warning was still in force.
On social media, there was an amateur video in which a man on the top floor of the building screams about an impending tsunami, desperately trying to attract the attention of people on the street.
A few minutes later, a wall of water collapses on the shore, carrying entire houses and cars.
Reuters has not yet confirmed the authorship of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami led to a large depletion of the power lines, which led to the loss of communication in Palu. This greatly hindered the rescue operations of the services.
Military transport aircraft have been sent from Jakarta and other cities with humanitarian assistance, but the evacuated population still lacks food and essentials, government sources say.
The city's airport was opened only for humanitarian assistance; it will be closed for other flights until October.
On Sunday, the evacuation centers in Palu will be visited by President Joko Vidodo.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia exceeds 800.
The situation is very bad.
Volunteers of the charity World Vision safely arrived from Dongala to Palu, where employees found shelter in the tarpaulin tents that were smashed in the courtyard of their office building. According to Doseba Sinai, a terrible picture of complete destruction appeared on their way to their eyes.
“They saw a huge number of houses destroyed,” he says.
The situation is very bad.
Charities have begun to implement humanitarian assistance mechanisms, but many have complained that experts from international NGOs have failed to reach Palau.
Indonesian law permits the attraction of funding, humanitarian assistance and staff of foreign organizations only after the announcement of the place where the disaster struck, a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
“This is believed to be a local disaster,” said Auliya Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government declares a national disaster, we will be able to accept foreign aid, but the status remains unchanged.”
On the second day after the natural disaster that shook Palu, friends and relatives of the missing still hope for their miraculous salvation, which will restore the population's faith in the best.
On Saturday, a little boy who fell into a sewer hatch was rescued.
On Sunday, rescuers pulled a woman from the wreckage of the building, who spent two days there, next to the breathless body of her mother.
Gendon Subandono, the Indonesia national paragliding coach, has prepared two of the missing pilots for the recently held Asian Games in Indonesia.
Among the other people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, including Mandagi.
“I’m not the last person in this sport, and it’s emotionally difficult to survive,” he said.
Gendon recalls how, after learning about the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel from other paragliders, over the next few hours he desperately tried to contact his colleagues from Palu, who were relaxing at the beach festival.
However, his messages were displayed with one gray tick instead of two blue ones.
“This means that the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Daring theft of $26,750 during ATM service in Newport-on-Live
On Friday morning, attackers stole $26,750 from cashier Brink's, who runs one of the ATMs in the city of Newport-on-Live, Newport police said in a press release.
According to investigator Dennis McCarthy, the driver of the armored minibus took cash from the ATM located in the entertainment complex and was going to fill it with new banknotes.
At this time, “an intruder ran to Brink’s employee from behind” and stole a bag of banknotes to refuel the ATM.
According to witnesses, several suspects fled the scene, but the police did not indicate the number of potential participants.
Citizens with any information about these individuals are requested to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to her
Rapper Kanye West has come up with a new name: Ye.
On Saturday, he tweeted: “A person formerly known as Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West has long carried this alias and even put it in the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The news came ahead of Kanye's appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he plans to release his new album Yandhi.
Kanye West will be acting as a lecturer in place of the singer Ariana, who canceled her participation due to “emotional experiences”, reports the author of the broadcast.
West previously stated that the pseudonym is not only a shortened version of his name, but also carries a religious meaning.
"Ye is the most common word in the Bible, it means 'you', 'you'," West explained the name of his album in one of the recent interviews with Big Boy.
“That’s me, that’s you, that’s us.
At first there was Kanye, which means "the only one", and now I am just Ye, that is, a reflection of everything good, bad, incomprehensible in us, all at once.
And the album is an attempt to figure out who we are.”
Kanye is not the first rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Daddy, Pi Diddy or simply Diddy, this year asked to call himself Love ("Love") or Braza Love ("Brotherly Love" or "Brotherly Love").
The rapper J-Z, who performed with West, also changed the spelling of his name several times: with and without a hyphen, with or without letters or lines.
Mexico’s president vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed never to resort to military force against civilians on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the student demonstration that ended in a bloody clash.
Speaking on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square, President Lopez Obrador promised “never to resort to the help of the army to suppress the Mexican people.”
At this place on October 2, 1968, during a peaceful demonstration of students, the first shots were fired at the crowd and the massacre began, killing 300 people. This occurred against the background of the strengthening of the left student movements in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador also pledged to support Mexican youth in the form of a monthly scholarship to study and open more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and the lack of prospects for study bring young people directly into the criminal world.
U.S. needs to double funding for AI development
China and its artificial intelligence (AI) efforts should not be underestimated — the U.S. should double its investment in its research, says Lee Kaifu, an AI development investor and entrepreneur with experience at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Earlier, statements about work on AI were made by several U.S. ministries, although in general the U.S. does not have a clear strategy in the field of AI development.
At the same time, China presented its own plan last year: its goal is to be the first in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the US, and we expect the next breakthrough in AI,” says Lee.
Doubling funding could double the chances that the next big AI achievement will be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most outstanding AI companies in China.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that surpassed the highest player in the U.S. at Otello, and then he was the head of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee mentioned previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Robotics Challenge, and wondered when the next competition would take place to help find people with unconventional thinking.
According to Lee, researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get government grants.
“It’s not China that absorbs academic leaders, it’s corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been hiring lights from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee is convinced that changes in immigration policy can also help the U.S. develop artificial intelligence.
“I think that green cards should automatically be offered to candidates in the field of artificial intelligence,” he says.
In July 2017, the State Council of China published a plan for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence.
The Chinese National Science Foundation allocates funding to scientists similar to how the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations allocate money to American researchers, but the quality of scientific work in China is lower, Li argues.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which should involve industry and scientific partners, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in a program called AI Next.
As for NSF, it is currently investing more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation, which sought to establish the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has not taken any action in this direction for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia on Sunday voted in a referendum on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", which would allow to resolve a long-standing dispute with Greece, which blocked its applications for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which includes the province of Macedonia, claims the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to its territory, and has vetoed its accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments signed an agreement based on a new name, but nationalist opponents argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia's population.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign questioned whether the voter turnout would match the 50 percent minimum required for the referendum.
The question put to the referendum was as follows: “Do you support membership of NATO and the EU subject to the adoption of a treaty with Greece?”
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia, should pay this price for joining such organizations as the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that it can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” says 79-year-old Olivera Georgievskaya, a resident of Skopje.
A sufficient number of parliamentarians have said they will abide by the results of the vote to make it decisive, although it does not have mandatory legal force.
The change of name will require a two-thirds majority of the members of parliament.
The State Electoral Commission said that no reports of violations had been received by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” says 62-year-old Jose Tanevski, a voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zoritsa and his son Dusko voted for a referendum in Macedonia on changing the country’s name, which will pave the way for its accession to NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage, placing chairs in front of the tents set up by those citizens who are going to boycott the referendum.
“We are in favour of NATO and EU membership, but we want to unite with a high head, not bypassing the thresholds of official offices,” Kavadarkov said.
Yes, we are citizens of a poor country, but we also have a sense of dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring the investments to Macedonia, which are so necessary for this country, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
“I believe that the overwhelming majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after the vote.
He believes that a positive response will be “the guarantor of our prosperous future.”
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Studies showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum, but this is below the required turnout.
In another poll conducted by the Macedonian channel Telecom-TV, it was found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy per cent of them said they would vote in favour.
For a referendum to take place, the turnout must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first major blow to pro-Western government policies since it came to power last May.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero bypasses Brighton's defense to score goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling dealt with Brighton's defense, leading Manchester City to a 2:0 win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
When Aguero scored a goal in the 65th minute, it didn’t seem to bother him.
At the beginning of the episode, the Argentine striker received a pass in the center of the field.
He walked between the three defenders of Brighton before breaking out into the open.
Aguero was surrounded by four rivals in green t-shirts.
He overtook one defender and overtook several more on the edge of the Brighton penalty zone.
He then handed the ball to Sterling on the left.
The English striker, while in the penalty zone, in one touch returned the ball Aguero, who with his right foot pierced the goalkeeper "Brighton" Matthew Ryan in the right corner of the gate.
“Aguero is having some problems with his legs,” Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We agreed that he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the "Heavenly Blue" the initial advantage in the Premier League fight.
That goal was scored in the 29th minute.
In this game Aguero got the ball, being deep in the territory of "Brighton"
He gave a great cut on the left flank on Leroy Sana.
Sane made several touches before handing the transmission to Sterling on the long bar.
The attacker of the "Heavenly Blues" scored the ball in the goal right before flying out of the field.
Manchester City clashed with Hoffenheim in the Champions League group on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer is going to pick up his glasses from the Colorado Rockies.
After the Washington Nationals left the battle for the playoffs, there was no particular reason to force events.
But tireless Sherzer hopes to take the lead in the fight against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the Rockies, ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in one game in the Western Division, will start to have problems in the playoffs.
With a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, the Rockies have already won at least 7 or 8th place, but they are still hoping to secure the title in the first division.
“And while we play just like that, at least we can hold our ground, knowing the enormous importance of the atmosphere in Denver in the presence of the spectators and the other team, probably unprecedented this year.
How can I miss that?”
The Nationals have not yet announced a pitcher on Sunday, but, according to the latest data, in the current situation tend to expose Sherzer to this role.
Sherzer, who is going to go to the 34th game, on Thursday threw the ball on the pitch for the pitchers, and on Sunday, on his weekend, will be the pitcher.

Trump conducts an election race in West Virginia
Speaking about the importance of the Republicans in the midterm elections, the president indirectly referred to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, the candidacy put forward by the president in the Supreme Court.
“Everything we did was put on the map in November.
Five weeks remain until one of the most important elections of our lives.
It’s very, very important. I’m not running, although I’m really running, fighting everywhere for good candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see this is happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means necessary, and we observe ugliness and abomination.
They don’t care who they offend, who they have to go through to get power and control, and that’s what they want — power and control, but we’re not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats, he argues, have set themselves the goal of “resisting and obstructing.”
“And you’ve been watching this for the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “evil, ugly, ugly and lying.”
He referred to the Senate Legal Committee, mentioning Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, which caused loud shouts from the hall.
“Do you remember her answer?
Have you allowed the contents of this document to leak?
Mmm... mmm... what document?
No, no. The tongue of the body gave it out, I have never seen the tongue of the body so refute words.”
The Labour Party is no longer an organization with different views.
They are not tolerant of those who express their opinions.
When the Momentum activists in my local party put forward a motion of no confidence in me, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last member of Parliament from the Labour Party who has not yet been told that we are not being welcomed for expressing our opinion.
The same is true of my colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, because she spoke strongly against anti-Semitism.
In my case, a vote of no confidence criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe – ironically, these are issues that Jeremy did not agree on with previous leaders.
A notice of the Nottingham East Labour Assembly on Friday said that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
Most of the time of my eight-year tenure as a local Labour MP, the GC’s Friday evening meetings were just that.
Unfortunately, today’s tone does not correspond to many meetings, and the promise of a “more humane and softer” policy has long been forgotten, if it ever was.
The fact that there is no difference of opinion in the Labour Party is becoming more and more evident, and every opinion is evaluated as to whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader; colleagues whose political outlook I previously considered to be similar to my own began to expect me to radically change my views and take positions that I would never agree with — be it national security or EU single market issues.
Every time after my public speech — and it doesn’t matter what I say — social media follows a tyranny of insults calling for the cancellation of elections, condemning the center’s policies, or claiming that I shouldn’t be a member of the Labour Party.
And it's not just me.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments to my address still tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those of my colleagues who are confronted every day with a flow of attacks on sexual or racist grounds, but never retreat.
The most disappointing thing about this policy is that such a large number of insults have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the “wide church,” and with every vote of no confidence or change in the rules of choice, the party becomes already.
“Over the past two years, I’ve received a lot of recommendations urging me to sit quietly and speak less, and then I’ll be all right.
But that’s not why I came into politics.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a student of a school outraged by the Thatcher government’s disdain for which my school class literally broke up, I have sought to uphold the highest standard of public service for those who need it most — whether it’s a government official or a local deputy.
I have never concealed my political views, and I have not done so in the past elections.
No one in Nottingham East could misinterpret my political positions and areas where I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported this vote on Friday, I would like to say the following: our country is moving so hard towards Brexit that it is guaranteed to inflict economic, industrial and state damage, and I do not understand the desire of some to waste their time and energy on the question of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only audience I would like to address is not Nottingham Momentum, but my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of cancellation of election results or political expediency will deter me from acting as I please.
Chris Leslie, Member of Parliament for Nottingham East County
Ear 38 - 17 Melrose: The Invincible "Ear" comes out in first place
The two late attempts may have somewhat distorted the final result, but, no doubt, Air deserved a triumph in this surprisingly interesting Premier League match.
Now they lead the table, the only invincible team of dozens.
After all, all thanks to their excellent protection, as well as the ability to choose the right moment, which gave the host team and coach Peter Mercy the right to be satisfied.
“All this time we’ve been tested for strength, and we’re still invincible, so I have no reason to be sad,” commented Peter Mercy.
Robin Christie, Melrose: “It’s worth paying tribute to Air, they’ve tried better than us.”
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt, realised by Fraser Climo, brought "Air" forward, but the yellow card issued for the game "Vorors" to Scottish player Rory Hughes allowed "Melrose" to come forward, and Jason Baggot caught up with the unrealized.
The climate increased the gap between Air and the penalty, before, right in the middle of the game, earned a point, and then in the break realized a single attempt, making a score of 17-5 in favor of Air.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson’s attempt, implemented by Buggot, narrowed the gap to five points.
Then there was a long break due to a serious injury to Ruarid Knott, who was stretched, and after the re-release, "Air" moved on thanks to Stafford McDowell's attempt made by Climo.
Acting Air captain Blair McPherson then received a yellow card, and again Melrose was forced to pay another player for Bruce Colvin's unrealized attempt, at the end of a period of fierce pressure.
However, the hosts returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for intercepting Climo without a ball from the penalty line, McPherson made a touchdown behind the approaching Air Mall.
Climate realized the advantage, not stopping almost from the very re-entry, after Kyle Rowe received a blow from David Armstrong and sent extreme striker Gregor Henry on the fifth attempt of the field's owners.
The star of Still Game is going to start a new career in the restaurant business
The star of the Still Game Ford Kiran is going to start working in the hotel industry: it became known that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, the script for which he writes, and is filmed with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemfill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last on the show, and it seems that Kirnan is planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official information, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the information, though a source at Scottish Sun suggested Kirnan plans to take part in a “thriving restaurant business” in Glasgow.
“Our Sea”: Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes that the court will once again open the way to the Pacific Ocean
The sailors patrol the naval headquarters in La Paz.
There are blue flags on public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted with the slogan: “Our sea is right.
“Returning it is our duty.”
Across Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, there is still a vivid memory of the coastline lost to Chile as a result of the bloody 19th-century conflict over resources; there is also a vivid desire to sail again across the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may have become the most daring in recent decades, as Bolivia awaits the decision of the international court, which will be held on 1 October as a result of five years of debate.
“Bolivia has the energy, the spirit of unity and the mental balance and, of course, they are waiting for a positive result,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Kalzadilla.
Many Bolivians will be watching the decision-making process in the International Court of Justice on big screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will be able to support Bolivia's statement that, after decades of tense negotiations, Chile has an obligation to negotiate Bolivia's sovereign entry to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia’s indigenous peoples, who is battling a difficult battle for re-election next year, is also anxiously awaiting a decision to be taken on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision in favor of Bolivia, and if it does, it will change little.
The UN body in the Netherlands has no authority to dispose of Chilean territory and has already said it will not affect the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice ruling was issued only six months after the latest arguments were heard suggests that the case “was not complicated,” says Pas Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
In the last four years, the case of Bolivia has not progressed, but on the contrary has been postponed all the time.
“Bolivia’s current administration has been experiencing the problem of access to the sea for criminal purposes,” Zarate said.
According to her, Morales’ warlike rhetoric destroyed Chile’s last benevolence.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions afterwards.
The two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Velce, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, does not agree that the court decision was made too quickly.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an exceptional opportunity to begin a new era of relations with Chile” and the chance to “end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit,” he said.
Kalzadilla also disagrees that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, uses the naval problem as a political ploy.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“The court’s decision is an opportunity to once again make sure that we have to move through our past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won’t happen until it can trust the U.S.
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his country would never go to the destruction of its nuclear weapons if it could not trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri spoke at a meeting of the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made at the Singapore summit between the leaders of its countries.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gradually returns to the path of resuming stalemate nuclear diplomacy more than three months after a meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
Ri argues that the dream that long-term sanctions and U.S. objections to the declaration to end the Korean War will ever put the North on its knees is a utopia.
Washington is afraid to approve the declaration unless Pyongyang takes significant steps to disarmament first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
But skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning the arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security, is widespread.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows showcase the latest line of massive headwear that promises to appear in mass sales and will be worn right next to you
If you want to add a hat to your collection or fully protect yourself from the sun's rays, there is no need to look for anything else.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a mass of unusual headwear, part of their SS19 collection and blinded visitors to Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, extremely impractical hats gained popularity among Instagram followers, and designers decided to send their stunning creations to the podium.
A distinctive copy of Valentino: the beige headdress, decorated with wide, feather-like fields, was painted on the heads of the models.
Other massive accessories included jewel-decorated watermelons, a magician’s hat, and even pineapple, but all of these headgear is not meant to warm your head in cold weather.
Tom Brown also showed the world a collection of bizarre masks, which had to be very much the day before Halloween.
Many of these colorful masks had their mouths sewn together, and they looked more like a portrait of Hannibal the Lector than a creation from leather.
One of the specimens resembled underwater equipment with a tube and safety glasses, and the other was melting ice cream.
If you are a fan of high fashion, you are in luck.
Fashion critics predict that these huge hats have every chance of breaking into mass sales – right to you.
Huge-sized hats go on the heels of La Bomba, a straw hat with two-foot-wide fields, which was already worn by everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratakovsky.
The cult label that released this extremely impractical hat, which gained such widespread popularity in social networks, gave birth to and sent a walk on the podium another huge accessory - a straw beach bag, almost as big as this bag itself dressed in a swimsuit, not a bag.
An orange branded raffia bag with a white leather handle and a raffia trim became a vivid copy of the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage tells FEMAIL: “I think big hats and beach bags will be on sale next summer. Since the designer has produced such furor with his works, it would be extremely difficult to ignore the demand for huge access.
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is of great importance to the citizens of the world
Scotland’s independent schools continue the tradition of brilliant education, which was once again confirmed in 2018: outstanding exam results demonstrated individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other socially significant disciplines.
These schools are part of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), where more than 30,000 students are trained throughout Scotland, and where they strive to provide the highest level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare their students for further higher education, their chosen careers, as well as for the status of citizens of the world.
As part of the education sector that is responsible for the development and implementation of an individual school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to a person in a language he understands, you call to his mind.
If you speak to him in his native language, you are addressing his heart.”
This is convincing evidence that we cannot rely only on English if we want to build relationships with citizens of other countries and be able to trust them.
According to the results of the last exams this year, we see that languages occupy leading positions in the league tables and have the highest score in terms of exam results in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received the highest grade “A”.
Data from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students received an "A" in Mandarin (Chinese), while 72 percent of students received an "A" in German, 69 percent in French and 63 percent in Spanish.
This proves that in independent schools in Scotland, foreign languages are undoubtedly considered vital for children and young people in the future.
Currently, language subjects are in the same demand as natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics in the curricula of independent schools and other educational institutions.
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that, among the reasons that created difficulties for employers in filling vacancies, 17 per cent had a lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly becoming the key to a successful future career for young people.
Given that more promising job positions require language skills, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what profession the student chooses, if he learns a second language, in the future he will gain a real advantage by mastering another additional skill that will be useful to him throughout his further life.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who knows several foreign languages a competitive advantage.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were not able to speak well enough in a foreign language to support the conversation, and French was the only language with a double-digit percentage – spoken by 15 percent of respondents.
That’s why investing in language education is so important right now.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a good job.
In schools in Scotland, there is a fairly wide spread in terms of the languages that are taught – each school has its own set of languages.
A number of schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK in light of the country’s future development until 2020 – such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of your child, independent schools will always have a choice of several languages with a teaching staff whose members are specialists in these languages.
Independent schools in Scotland seek to create a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what their future may be.
At present, it cannot be denied that, in the global business environment, languages remain vital for the future development of the country, and this should be reflected in education accordingly.
In fact, modern languages really need to be seen as “skills of international communication.”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, providing diversity and benefits for Scotland’s youth.
You have to do it right.
John Edwards, Director of the Council of Independent Schools of Scotland
LeBron makes his Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday.
The fans’ frantic wait to see LeBron James perform for the first time at the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in a pre-season Sunday game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But he still has to figure out how much time he has to play.
“More than one and less than forty-eight,” Walton replied on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited time.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season games in the Lakers schedule.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare for the season,” he said.
Trump's election race in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a wave of pre-election meetings tonight in Willing, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump’s five scheduled meetings next week, including a visit to friendly Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the vote on his candidacy for the Supreme Court has been postponed, Trump is seeking support in the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress if the vote is held in November.
What time is Trump’s meeting in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
The meeting with Trump in Willing, West Virginia, will take place at 7 p.m. Eastern time today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s meeting with voters in West Virginia live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak at hearings this week to nominate his candidate Brett Kavanaugh as the Supreme Court Justice. Trump’s proposal for this candidacy has caused a lot of negative reactions as Kavanaugh was accused of sexual harassment, and the vote, which was due to take place in the Senate, will go away.
But the main goal of this action is to help Republicans going to the November elections to increase the electoral rate.
Thus, President Trump’s campaign aims to help these five meetings, which are due to take place next week, “activate the activities of volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives,” Reuters writes.
“Control over Congress is so important to his agenda that the president should visit as many states as possible, because we are entering a tense season of election campaigning,” said Trump’s campaign spokeswoman, who declined to be named.
The action planned today at the Wesbanco Arena in Willing can attract supporters from “... Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the media attention of Pittsburgh,” reports West Virginia Metro News.
Trump’s visit to West Virginia on Saturday is the state’s second visit in a month, where he gained an advantage of more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
“The fact that in order for Morrissey to start out ahead of the polls, the president has to come is a bad sign for Morrissey himself,” said Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
2018 Rider’s Cup: U.S. National Team Demonstrates Fighting Readiness and Fuels Hope by Going to Couples Competitions on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday's two-on-two game may have been exactly what the Rider's Cup needed.
Transitional initiative is an exceptionally imaginary sports concept, but it is believed by players, and in such competitions it is particularly pronounced.
So who has the initiative?
“They had a six-point advantage, and now four, so I think it’s a small initiative for us,” Spit said.
Of course, Europe has an advantage of four points, and another twelve on the line.
Americans, according to Spit, feel the “wind in the sails,” and they have reason to keep their breath up, not least because Spit and Justin Thomas played together all day, and everyone can boast three out of four points.
The sleep was inflexible from you to the green, than the personal example.
The victorious shouts became louder as his round continued, pushing the decisive ball into the hole, closing the match when he and Thomas gave in two by two.
His blow, which gave them victory in the game at the 15th hole, was met with a similar cry, one of those that speak of his belief in a chance for the American team.
“You need to gather with all your strength and focus only on your own game,” Spit said.
That’s all that’s left for the players.
Go through 18 holes and become a winner.
The only players who have earned more points in the last two days than Sleep and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who have undoubtedly entered the history of the Ryder Cup.
A strange but charming couple from Europe has knocked out four out of four, and they don’t seem to know the mistakes.
The Mollywoods were the only couple who did not gather gods on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided gods on Saturday morning, on Friday afternoon, and, again, on Friday morning.
Such a series and how their energy seems to circulate between them and furious fans, strengthens the belief that even on Sunday they will not be defeated, and when the sun hides behind the horizon of the field "Le Golf National", there will be no more famous player Fedley, or Moody's fortifying the potential victory of Europe.
It would be great if they were both in different holes at the same time.
However, it is too early to talk about the glory of Europe.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of the four-ball game, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
The Boggs and two double gods dug a hole in the first nine holes for the Spaniard and the Swede, from which they were never able to get out.
So no one will help you get out of your pit on Sunday.
It’s so exciting to watch a four-ball and four-player game because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they exchange, and the deliberate silence, and how the strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better as a team, and has made significant strides on the last day, but this session of four has also shown that the U.S. national team has all the strength to fight, which some, especially in America, have doubted.
On the final day of the Ryder Cup Europe leads with a score of 10-6
Europe will get a noticeable advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after Saturday's four-ball and four-ball matches with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the fight with two victories over struggling Tiger Woods to bring the score to Le Golf National to four points.
The European team of Thomas Björn, wanting to regain the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the mistake of the American team in the morning games in four balls, winning with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. made more resistance in the four, winning two games, but they were unable to narrow the gap in the score.
Jim Fairy's team needs eight points from 12 Sunday matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Mollywood" after the sensational weekend, became only the second pair to win four points in the first four matches in the history of the Rider's Cup.
Defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls, they then teamed up brilliantly to defeat fallen spirit Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechebmo with even more decisive 5/4.
Woods, who played two Saturday matches, showed periodic flashes, but now he has lost 19 of 29 games in four balls and four in seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested before the morning game in four balls, returned to teammate Henry Stanson in the four, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Cap with a score of 2/1, occupying the first and third places in the world.
For Europe, the game has not become an easy and pleasant walk refreshing day to the southwest of Paris.
Earned by three-time champions Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas on Saturday, two points became a benchmark for Americans.
They earned a decisive 2/1 victory over the Spaniards John Ram and Ian Polter in a four-ball game and came back later to defeat Polter and Rory McKillroy with a 4/3 score in the fours, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Rider's Cup, the team was out of the four-point back, coming out alone, given that the team of Ferrer, as the hosts, had to play down to hold the trophy.
However, after two days of holding second place, the counterattack on Sunday seems to be beyond their means.
North Korea says it will “categorically” not disarm unilaterally without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions heightened distrust of the United States and that his country would not unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons under any circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "substantial goodwill measures" last year, such as cessation of nuclear and missile tests, dismantling of the nuclear site, and an obligation not to build up nuclear weapons stocks and develop nuclear technologies.
“However, we are not seeing a symmetric reaction from the United States,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not be able to unilaterally be the first to take action on disarmament.”
While Ri repeated the already-sounding North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to the “stage” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea will be rewarded for gradual steps, his statement seemed important in the sense that it did not reject the unilateral denuclearization.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between the incumbent U.S. president and the North Korean leader, which took place in Singapore on June 12; then Kim promised to start a movement toward “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” by Trump.
North Korea seeks to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington is also resisting calls to loosen tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States insists that ‘denuclearization must first take place,’ and increases the level of pressure through sanctions in order to forcefully achieve its goal, and even opposes ‘an announcement of the end of the war,’” Ri says.
“The idea that sanctions can put us on our knees is a utopian dream of people who don’t know us.
But the real problem is that the ongoing sanctions increase our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader mentioned at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea were on the side of the denuclearization issue, not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have been so.”
However, Ri’s tone was sharply different from last year’s when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korea’s missiles on the US mainland was inevitable after “Mr. President Evil” Trump called Kim a “suicide rocket.”
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said there was still much to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea disarms.
On Wednesday, Trump said he does not set any deadlines for the process: “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months does not matter.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should encourage Pyongyang for the steps that have been taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday, “The Security Council’s imposition of sanctions should continue actively and obligatory until we see full, final and confirmed denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously intensified sanctions against North Korea since 2006, seeking to curb funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly summit and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip failed.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying progress had been made, but within hours of that visit, North Korea condemned him for “banditry demands.”
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle the missile complex, as well as the nuclear complex, if the United States took “appropriate action” on its part.
According to him, Kim told him that the “appropriate measures” he spoke of were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore, as well as actions aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Learn to Rest in Special Classes
The new course, introduced this year at Harvard University, has helped all primary school students learn to sleep more and fight the chauvinistic culture of continuous caffeine intake in order to wake them up “overnight”.
One of the academics found that the most successful students in the world often have no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chassler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
After his discovery, he set fire to the idea of introducing such a course, having made a preliminary report on the impact of lack of sleep on learning processes.
“At the end of my report, a girl came up to me and said, ‘I’m very sorry that I found out about this just now that I’m almost finishing school.’
She said no one ever told her about the importance of sleep — which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, first offered to students this year, talks about how a healthy sleep habit contributes to academic and sporting achievement, as well as how it improves a person’s overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University’s Health Service, says the university decided to introduce this course after it was found that students were experiencing a severe lack of sleep during the study week.
The class lasts one hour, students perform a number of interactive tasks.
One of the sections of the lesson offers an image of a room in the dormitory, where students, pressing on coffee cups, curtains, simulators and books, get information about how each of these actions and substances — coffee, light, which cause a lack of sleep — affect the amount of enough to get enough sleep, and how important it is to get enough sleep.
In another section, participants will learn how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The interactive campus map encourages course participants to reflect on their daily lives.
“We understand that these classes will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know, just like any other person has a right to know, for example, how smoking affects their health,” Professor Chassler added.
According to him, a false sense of pride that a person can “walk all night” is still quite common, and modern technologies, as well as increasing pressure on students, mean that sleep deprivation becomes a problem.
According to him, a sufficient amount of good quality sleep is the student’s “secret weapon” to fight stress, nervous exhaustion and anxiety, and even to fight overweight, as lack of sleep puts the brain into starvation mode, causing it to constantly feel hungry.
Raymond Sow, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chassler develop a course by attending one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to spread this information across the campus.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all postgraduate students to go through a similar curriculum before entering a competitive school.
Professor Chassler recommends students install an alarm clock that warns them to go to bed and wake up, as well as remembering the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lamps that disrupt a person’s biorhythm and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goal Menga brings victory over Gerrard's team
The Rangers experienced another sad departure meeting, as Dolly Menga's goal led Stephen Gerrard's undefeated team to a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
Ibrox's team had hoped to get their first win at home after a 4-1 victory at St. Johnston in February, but Gary Holt's team only defeated Gerrard in 18 games as manager, leaving his team's team eight points behind.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers, who lost their spirits, seemed not going to settle the score.
While the Rangers are now down to sixth, Livingston is up to third, and only Hibernian is down in head-to-head ratios.
And the Rangers may have additional problems after line judge Kalum Spence had to heal the head wound after an item was thrown out of the guest sector.
Gerrard made eight replacements in the team that went through the Air in the semi-finals for the Scottish League Cup.
In turn, Holt went with the same strategy as Livy 11, which increased the gap with the Charts last week, and he would be happy to see how his well-armed line-up squeezed opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have led the way in the possession of the sword, but the Livingstones squeezed far more when the ball hit them.
They had to score a goal in just two minutes when Meng's first transfer to Scott Pittman was stopped by Allan McGregor, but the midfielder took advantage of the opportunity.
Kigan Jacobs made a penalty shot at team captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Litgow, only managed to send the ball to the far pole.
The Rangers took control, but in the last third there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos was confident that he had to hit the penalty kick in the forty-fifth minute when he and Stephen Lowless collided, but Judge Stephen Thomson disagreed with the Colombian’s statement.
The Rangers made only two strikes in the first half, but Ibrox's former goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was hardly concerned about Lassan Kulibali's header, and Ovi Ejaria's weak blow.
Although Livy's first goal, scored in the 34th minute, may not have matched the game, no one can deny that they deserved it solely by their own hard work.
But again, the Rangers failed to cope with the game of Jacobs from a standard position.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher handed the ball to Scott Robinson, who was trying his best to pass the ball to Meng to complete.
Gerrard began acting at a break when he traded Kulibali for Ryan Kent, and such a replacement almost immediately resulted when the extreme midfielder gave Morelos a pass, but the impressive Kelly ran off his line to intercept.
But the Livingstones continued to draw guests into the game they had planned with Litgow and Halkett, constantly making long broadcasts.
Holt's team tried to increase the gap in the final stages, but McGregor was able to block Jacobs before Litgow gave the transmission from the corner of the field.
Rangers back-up Glenn Middleton once again called for a penalty kick after he bumped into Jacobs, but Thomson refused again.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now the page of our almanac “Sunday morning”: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago on this day in Germany was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Gans” Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity — an invention that eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Becoming one of the foundations of science, Geiger’s counter became also one of the foundations of popular culture, and this was reflected in the 1950s film The Coronado Bell, featuring cowboy-like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans — seemingly unlike scientists — in the main roles:
Man: “What kind of thing is this?”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you can really hear the influence of atoms generated by radioactivity in minerals.”
Evans: “Here, I can hear you right now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But his invention, named after its author, is still widely used.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to ‘See’ Abnormal Cells
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to ‘See’ Abnormally Growing Cells and Kill Them
Part of the therapeutic action of the vaccine is to teach the immune system to recognize abnormal cells.
The method is to extract immune cells from the patient and change them in laboratory conditions.
As a result of this change, the cells gain the ability to “see” the type of protein typical of many cancers, then the cells must be re-entered.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one patient who was given the vaccine and whose immune system learned to recognize abnormal cells, ovarian cancer has been in remission for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract the patient’s immune cells and change them in laboratory conditions, after which the altered cells can “see” the HER2 protein, typical of many cancers, then the altered cells are re-injected to the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, U.S. National Cancer Research Institute, Vifezda, Maryland, says: “The results we have obtained suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
Professor Berzofski explains: HER2 “stimulates the growth of several cancers,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers.
A similar method has been successfully applied in the treatment of leukemia. It was to collect immune cells in patients and "teach" them how to affect cancer cells.
Kanye West defended Trump in the MAGA hat after his appearance in the SNL.
Everything went badly.
Kanye West was inducted into the studio during a Saturday concert in which he defended U.S. President Donald Trump, claiming that he would retake that position in 2020.
After performing his third song, “Ghost City,” which he wore with the cap “Make America Great Again,” the singer spoke out against the Democrats and backed Trump.
“Very often I talk to white people and they ask me, ‘How can you support Trump, he’s a racist?’
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL channel did a parody show with Matt Damon in the lead role, in which the Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Christina Blaise Ford’s sexual harassment allegations.
On television, they did not show how the crowd was upset by West's statement, but this video was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not clear if Rock tried to ridicule West with this move.
In addition, West complained to the public that his hat was ridiculed behind the scenes.
“They were kidding me on stage.
They say don't go out in that hat.
They were really kidding me!
The Washington Examiner quotes him as saying, “They also said that my position is not cool.”
West continues: “Do you want to know what’s not cool? Wear a superman’s coat so no one can tell you what to do. Do you want the world to continue developing?
“Then you need love.”
His comments, at least twice, attracted the attention of the audience, members of the cast of SNL seemed confused, and one person told the publication: "The whole studio has plunged into silence."
West was invited at the last minute as a replacement for singer Ariane Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days before that.
Many were puzzled by West's performance of "I Love It" in the Perrier bottle suit.
West received the support of the head of the conservative group TPUSA Candice Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "One of the bravest people: THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING MANY".
The host of the talk show, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was simply “who he is, and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
“However, I don’t want to support anyone (buying his music, clothing, or otherwise supporting his creativity) who, in my view, shares and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He is a free man.
Just like us,” she said.
Before the show began, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puffy, Puffy and Pi Diddy.
His colleague, rapper Snoop Dogg, originally had the name Snoop Lion, and as another example, of course, we can bring an artist who has recently become a legend, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol, and then to the name of the artist, formerly known as "Prince".
Attempted murder charge for knife-wielding at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after one of his visitors died of knife wounds in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Balihacamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast World Court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones star Keith Harrington attacks toxic masculinity
Keith Harrington is known for his sword-swinging role in John Snow’s brutal medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, recently, the 31-year-old actor has hotly criticized the macho-hero stereotype, saying that such characters often inspire young people with the idea that in order to be respected, you have to be cruel.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he believed “something went wrong” and wondered how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married his co-star from Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, his peer, admitted that he was “very unequal” to the issue.
“Personally, I take this question quite seriously: where did we go wrong with the perception of masculinity?” the actor asks.
“What do we teach growing up kids that we have such a problem today?”
Keith believes that television may be partly to blame for this spike in toxic masculinity due to overly muscular characters.
The actor continues: “What is innate and what is acquired?
What is being taught on television and on the streets that makes young men feel that they should show only one certain side of masculinity?
I think this is really one of the biggest problems of our time, and the question is how can we change that?
Because with young people today, something is really wrong.
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not take part in any of the Game of Thrones prequels or sequels after the series ends next summer, saying he had “done battles and horses.”
Starting in November, Keith will play the lead role in Sam Shepard’s remake of True West, which tells the story of the film’s producer and his brother, the robber.
The actor recently announced that he believes a meeting with his wife Rose is the best Game of Thrones finale for him.
“I met my wife on this show, so he gave me my family and my next life,” he said.
Rose played The Gamer, an object of passion for the character of Keith John Snow in an Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple celebrated their wedding in June 2018 at the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 per cent increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people in the country are sick with these diseases.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were registered.
In the vast majority of new cases, the disease was sexually transmitted, which indicates a change in the trends of the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some areas of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of HIV infections in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing every year by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an acute problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but LGBT discrimination is still widespread.
Studies confirm that because of the conservative values of the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
In many cases, transmission of diseases is due to inadequate protection of these sexual minorities.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies information about leaked information about the fault of Republican senators, complaining about “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. lawmaker Maxine Waters on Saturday denied accusations that one of her employees had posted personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on the legislators' Wikipedia pages.
A Democrat from Los Angeles claims the lawsuits were falsified by “ultra-right” experts and websites.
“Lies, lies, and even more vicious lies,” Waters said on Twitter.
It is reported that the published information includes the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsay Graham, Southern California, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and was published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a hearing in a Senate commission on sexual harassment charges brought against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after three senators interrogated Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the messages was linked to the Waters office, and disclosed information about Waters employees, Hill reports.
“This unfounded claim is absolutely false,” Waters said.
“A member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent actions was in no way responsible for the leak of that information.
This unwarranted claim is a complete lie.”
Waters' statement immediately sparked criticism on the Internet, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“It’s an angry denial,” Fletcher writes.
“This means that the author has a temperament that is unsuitable for working in Congress.
When you're accused of something you didn't do, why be angry?
You don't have to justify yourself either.
The motives of the accusers should not be dug either.
We need to stay calm and cold.”
Flasher appeared to have compared Waters’ reaction to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of being too angry during Thursday’s hearings.
Omar Navarro, a Republican nominee running for Waters’s seat in the midterm elections, also voiced his thoughts on Twitter.
“If it’s true, it’s very important,” he writes.
In a statement, Waters said her office had warned “the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities about these fraudulent actions.
“We will ensure that criminals are found and that they are legally responsible for all of their actions, which can be destructive and dangerous to all of my staff.”
Johnny English strikes again – a weak parody of spy Rowan Atkinson
Today, it has become a tradition to look for the meanings of Brexit in any new film that somehow depicts the UK; this also applies to the new parody spy franchise “Agent Johnny English”, whose production began in 2003 and continued in 2011 with the film “Agent Johnny English: Reboot”.
Will the self-ironic picture with the leitmotif “obviously we’re all shit” become a new attempt at national exports?
In any case, the rubber-faced proficient Johnny English got his right to chaos a second time – this is his name most vividly hints at the fact that he is a wide-screen comic creation intended for a non-English cinematic audience.
The hero, of course, is a stupid secret agent who, despite his quirky claims for a glamorous smurf, received a little Clouseau, features Mr. Bean and a portion of this guy who made a single note in the 2012 Chariots of Fire melody in London at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games.
Originally, this character was created on the basis of the identity of the traveler and the mysterious "international" Atkinson, who once played in the now-forgotten television commercial Barclaycard, in which the hero leaves behind a complete chaos.
In this last issue of JE there are one or two pleasant moments.
I really liked the scene when Johnny English was approaching the helicopter, dressed in medieval armor, and the blades were climbing on his helmet.
Yes, it demonstrates Atkinson’s gift to the physical performance of comedy scenes, but the humor itself seems rather weak and strangely superfluous, especially because such “serious” film rehearsals as “Agent 007” and “Mission Impossible” are now confidently offering comedy as an element.
The sense that humor is meant for children, not adults, and for me, Johnny English’s bizarre atrocities are not as inventive and appropriate as Atkinson’s jokes in Mr. Bean’s films.
The constant message now is that the UK is in serious trouble.
The cyber-hacker penetrated into the UK’s top-secret spy network, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of duty agent Kevin Eldon here, unfortunately, got an episodic role.
This is the last drop for the prime minister, a bloated and insistent figure already suffering from enormous political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything possible for the character Quasi-Teresa-May, but in the script there is nothing to work with.
Her intelligence advisers tell her that since every active spy has been compromised, she will have to resign.
And here on the stage is the clumsy Johnny English himself, who now works as a school teacher in some pontoon institution, but also gives informal lessons of secret operative work: here are a few good jokes, as English offers the skills of a spy academy in the style of "rock".
The Englishman returns to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunites with his unfortunate ex-boyfriend Baf, who this time is played by Ben Miller.
Buff is now a married man who obeys the commander of the submarine - the role of "joyful hockey sticks", in which Vicky Pepperdine is a little lost.
So, Batman and Robin are back in the game due to the fact that in the secret service of Her Majesty there have been terrible mistakes. They face the beautiful vicious woman Ophelia Bulletova performed by Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister dangerously falls under the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve British computer problems—the sinister Jason Volt, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Buff begin their odyssey of farcical jokes: disguised as waiters, they ignite a French restaurant; they create chaos by smuggling themselves on the luxurious yacht of Volt; English generates a complete anarchy by trying to use a headset of virtual reality.
All of these scenes, of course, are a cute and gritty invention, but in all of this there is something quite childish.
Quite a moderate thing.
And as with Johnny English’s other films, I couldn’t help but think: can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that is really proportionate to his talent?
Labour denies that they are working on a plan to reduce the working week of Britons to four days for a five-day salary
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is going to consider a radical plan under which the British will work four days a week, but will receive payment in five days.
The party reportedly wants company executives to give workers the savings earned as a result of the artificial intelligence revolution by giving them an extra day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend for the same salary.
Sources reported that the idea “fits” into the economic agenda of the party and will help the population of the country to side with the workers.
The Congress of Trade Unions approved the transition to a four-day working week so that workers can benefit from the benefits of a changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: The policy review is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
“This will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is our goal, which is in line with the party’s approach to changing the balances in the economy in favor of workers, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party is not the first to support the idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its 2017 election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not currently endorsed by the majority of the Labour Party.
A Labour representative said: “The four-day working week is not a party policy and is not considered by the party.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week’s Labour conference to concrete his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to seize power from “unlikeable directors” and “speculators” of utilities.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that current water channel shareholders may not get their full share back, as the Labour government can make “calculations” based on alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed plans to include workers on the boards of directors of companies and create Inclusive Ownership Funds to transfer 10% of the capital of private sector firms to workers who will be able to receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsay Graham and John F. Kennedy talk about 60 Minutes, Could the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh change their minds?
The FBI’s investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his appointment to the post of Chief Justice for at least a week and raises the question of whether the agency’s findings could encourage any of the Republican senators to support Kavanaugh.
In an interview shown on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelli interviewed Republican senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsay Graham about whether the FBI could find anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Of course,” Kennedy replied.
“Going to the meeting, I said I was talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, this information came out, I asked, “Did you do this?”
His answer was decisive, definite and unequivocal.”
But Graham's opinion in the vote remained unchangeable.
“I’ve made a firm decision about Brett Kavanaugh, and my opinion can only be changed by arguments, by the force of action comparable to that of dynamite,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but one thing I know for sure: Brett strongly denied it all,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blaise Ford.
“None of those she summoned as witnesses could confirm these facts either.
This story is 36 years old.
I didn’t notice anything new in it.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York, an annual music event featuring an impressive star cast with an equally impressive mission – the end of poverty around the world.
For the seventh year of the Festival, tens of thousands of people flock to the large lawn of Central Park, but not only to enjoy performances by performers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to tell about the real purpose of the event: the eradication of the 20th century.
The World Citizens Festival, which opened in 2012, is a continuation of the global project to combat poverty, which is being carried out by an international group of human rights defenders, hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free event ticket (if you’re not willing to pay for a VIP ticket), you’ve had to volunteer or email the world’s leader, make a phone call, or take any other or other meaningful action aimed at helping raise awareness of your goal.
But how successful has the Festival of the Citizens of the World become in 12 years in terms of achieving its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concert attendance really to convince fellow citizens to call for action, or is it just another case of so-called “clitivism” when people believe they are making real changes by signing an online petition or sending messages on Twitter?
Organizers of Global Citizen say that since 2011, the festival has registered more than 19 million “shares” held by its supporters, which pursue many different goals.
Through these actions, world leaders have pledged to allocate more than $37 billion, which is expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group announced 390 commitments and announcements that were made as a result of its actions, at least $10 billion of which have already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds allocated have provided direct assistance to nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the most significant commitments is called The Power of Nutrition: a British partnership of investors and implementation specialists committed to “helping children fully unlock their potential,” Global promised to provide Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in more than 47 districts. This was done after
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustice against malnutrition a thing of history,” Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracy Ullman said during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Food Power project, which will cover 5 million women and children through activities aimed at improving nutrition.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the festival’s website, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
The organizers of Global Citizen respond: “This will be a long and difficult journey on which we will stumble and fall from time to time.
But as in the great movements of the struggle for civil rights and against apartheid, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Jeanelle Monnet – here are some of the artists who will perform at this year’s event in New York, and its leaders will be Deborah-Lee Fernes and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use navy to “block” Russia’s energy exports: Interior Minister
U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke said Washington could “if necessary” resort to the help of its navy to prevent Russian energy supplies from entering markets, including in the Middle East.
Zinke argues that Russia’s presence in Syria, especially where it acts at the invitation of a legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think the reason they’re in the Middle East is because they want to trade energy the same way they do in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe,” he says.
And, according to the official, there are certain ways and means to solve this problem.
“The United States, together with our navy, has the opportunity to ensure the openness of the seaways and, if necessary, blockade so that their energy does not enter the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event, organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that positions itself as the “voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
He then compares Washington’s approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are in fact the same.
“The economic strategy of Iran and Russia is more or less efficient use and replacement of fuel,” he said, calling Russia a “one-trick pony” whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
The statements were made in connection with the fact that the Trump administration has set the task of increasing the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which offers a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to exit the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a “captive” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 project, which should double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s fierce resistance to this project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I emphasize that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position provoked a negative reaction from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
German industrialists in the Federation of German Industry (BDI) called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“When a third country interferes in our energy supplies, it creates a serious problem,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts State Senator Elizabeth Warren Will Carefully Study Opportunities to Run for President in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would carefully study the possibility of running for president after the midterm elections.
At a meeting of the City Duma in Hollywood, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider participating in the election race.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and ‘fix’ our broken government, and for that ‘up’ we need a woman,” says Warren The Hill.
“After November 6, I will carefully consider the possibility of running for president.”
Warren praised President Donald Trump’s actions during the meeting as “leading this district in the wrong direction.”
“I’m deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren is an outspoken critic of both Trump and Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, “Of course, we need to do an FBI investigation before we get to the polls.”
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that most of Warren’s voters themselves don’t think she should run in 2020.
According to a poll by the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe Center for Political Studies, fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent of respondents, on the contrary, support its plans.
The poll showed that the population is more supportive of former Governor Deval Patrick: 38 percent support his possible participation in the election, and 48 percent oppose it.
Other well-known Democrat names that have been discussed in connection with the 2020 prospect include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden claims he will make a formal decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin told about post-traumatic stress disorder Trac Palin at a meeting with voters of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, who entered the army in September, spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“My son, who has returned home, is experiencing the same things now as other family members who are experiencing the effects of PTSD and who have been injured, and our soldiers are returning with injuries,” she said at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "a glimmer in the eye" and said of her son and other war veterans: "They're coming back by others, hardened, wondering if there's the same respect for their comrades, soldiers, pilots, and any other military they've shown to their country."
Palin was arrested Monday in Vassilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman by interfering in a situation of violence and possession of an intoxicated weapon, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Vassilla police department.
18 States, District of Columbia, Support the Challenge of a New Asylum Policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that prohibits asylum for victims of escape or domestic violence.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and districts filed an analytical note in Washington on Friday by a court adviser on support for a policy-challenging asylum seeker.
The plaintiff’s full name in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy is not disclosed.
The woman claims that her civilian husband “and his sons in a criminal group” subjected her to cruel treatment, but on July 20 U.S. officials rejected her request for asylum.
She was arrested in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace say El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala are filing a large number of asylum applications in the U.S. as countries facing widespread problems with criminal groups and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a decision by the Immigrant Appeals Board in 2014 that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney General Carl Rasin said in a statement Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of application of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be examined on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a prohibition violates this principle,” the court adviser said in a statement.
Lawyers also argue that a policy that prohibits immigrants from entering is damaging the U.S. economy, stressing that it is this category of citizens who are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary workforce.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer provide shelter to victims fleeing domestic or gang violence.
"Asylum will be granted to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on the grounds of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political beliefs," Sassner said in a statement on June 11.
This tool was never intended to solve absolutely all the problems, even the most serious ones that people face every day around the world.
Desperate efforts to save people in Palu: death toll doubles in search of survivors
For the survivors, the situation became more and more difficult.
“It’s very difficult now,” says the 35-year-old mother of Risa Kusuma, comforting her sick baby in the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palu.
“Each minute an ambulance brings in the wounded.
Clean water is in great need.”
Residents return to their destroyed homes, digging into wet things and trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals affected by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were overloaded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Harris, who had a fractured spine and shoulder, rested near the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors because they were forced to leave the room due to ongoing strong shocks.
He cries as he recalls how a powerful earthquake destroyed a hotel room on the fifth floor he was filming with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time for salvation.
I think I’ve been stuck in the wreckage of the wall,” Harris told the Associated Press, explaining that his family had come to the city for the wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and our baby.
I hope they're safe and now they're all right."
US Ambassador accuses China of “attacks” carried out through “propaganda advertising”
A week after one of China’s official newspapers published a four-page ad in a daily American newspaper about the mutual benefits of U.S. and Chinese trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to a paid supplement to the Des Moines Register China Daily, the largest commercial newspaper in the state of Iowa, accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. Congress elections, which will be held on November 6. This accusation will be denied by China.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in U.S. elections is a confirmation of what U.S. officials told Reuters: a new stage is coming in Washington’s escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is the norm for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a state of escalating trade war, as a result of which they align tariffs on their countries’ imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were aimed at hitting exporters in states such as Iowa who backed Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, claims Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad writes in an article published in the Sunday issue of the Des Moines Register, “is now doubling this travail by posting propaganda advertisements in our own free press.”
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is enjoying our heartfelt American tradition of free speech and free press by paying for and posting ads on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad writes.
“However, in the newsstands here, on the streets of Beijing, you are unlikely to hear dissenting voices and not see the true diversity of opinions that the Chinese could get acquainted with after learning about China’s troubling economic policy,” the local media said in a statement.
He also added that one of China’s most famous newspapers “handily renounced” the offer to publish his article, although he did not give the exact name of the publication.
Analysts warn: Kavanaugh split Republicans push back women voters on the eve of the interim period
Many high-ranking Republicans prefer to stay aside and defend the candidacy of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, despite several allegations of sexual violence. Analysts warn that there is a negative reaction here, especially from women, which may affect the upcoming elections.
Emotions around this situation have soared to the extreme, and most Republicans have officially stated that they want to continue voting.
You can’t go back to these things later, writes Grant Rier, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, in his article published on Saturday.
Riere doubts whether Senator Jeff Fleck (R-Arizona)’s attempts to conduct a last-minute FBI investigation will be enough to reassure angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday. They will not forget it either tomorrow or in November,” Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national representative of the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington, D.C. newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November ahead!” in front of the Senate when the Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee decided to nominate Kavanaugh, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blaisey Ford.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond that,” said non-partisan political scientist Stu Rotenberg.
“People say that the situation has already inflamed enough, and that’s true.
But things can get worse, especially in terms of suburban female voters and young voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford publicly testified against the Supreme Court candidate, accusing him of sexual harassment, analysts had assumed that if Republicans confirmed the nomination, this move could trigger a backlash.
“This is already a mess for the Republican Party,” Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about a committee vote or a final vote or whether or not Kavanaugh sits on the bench of the defendants, it’s also about how Republicans handle it, how they treat it,” said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided on the question of who to trust anyway — Ford or Kavanaugh, and a little more inclined to the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents believe Ford’s statements accurately or most likely, while 35 percent said they believe Kavanaugh exactly or most likely.
In addition, 38 percent believe that Kavanaugh most likely or definitely lied while giving his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
At the insistence of Fleck, the FBI is currently investigating the charges brought by Ford, as well as at least another prosecutor — Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified on the Senate Legal Committee that Kavanaugh, being intoxicated, attacked her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the post of Supreme Judge showed her her genitals at a party while studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that claims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technological legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open platform Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people to give access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt’s goal was to gain “world domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he says of his startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own “personal online data repositories” or PODs.
It may contain lists of contacts, cases, as well as a calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools for working with data.
The app works on the same principle as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify – all can be used in one browser and at the same time.
The uniqueness of a personal online store of data is that it is fully managed by the user, who can access any necessary information.
The company calls this principle “a personal extension of rights and opportunities through data.”
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company has provided the resources, processes and relevant skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
Currently, the company includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform purchased by IBM, several full-time developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not in talks with Facebook and Google about whether his company should make a drastic change that will change all their business models overnight.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “the mission of Inrupt is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating a World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee’s voice has sounded quite influential in the debate about net neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web consortium, the Internet Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Internet,” says Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: a clergyman awarded the Victoria Cross during the First World War
In the history of the Anglican Church, only one priest-warrior was awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I, and this event was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded this award on 29 September 1918 for his participation in the attack on Bellenglis and Leucur.
Unfortunately, he was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing that he had received the highest British military award.
The monument in honor of this event was solemnly opened presented by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was “very symbolic” that the monument was opened exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the award.
According to the London Gazette of September 29, 1918, Lt. Col. Vann conducted his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal “in a very thick fog and under a strong fire of field guns and machine guns.”
He later threw himself on the line of fire and with "great courage" led the group forward, and then dropped a field gun with one hand, knocking down the three soldiers of the unit.
Colonel Vann was assassinated by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
The 72-year-old grandson of the hero, Michael Vann, said that "he would hardly have been able to do the same heroic thing, but it's humiliating."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid the wreath at the end of the parade, which was conducted by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said that "it is a great honor for him to take part in the parade" and added that "the kindness of a true hero is confirmed by the support that will be provided by many people."
MMA fans didn’t sleep all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead showed them a pig to Pepp
Imagine that you didn’t sleep all night to watch the full Bellator 206, but you weren’t allowed to see the main event.
The San Jose table contained 13 battles, including six main program battles, the battles were broadcast all night live on UK TV channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Musashi and Rory McDonald were preparing for the meeting, fans in the UK were stunned to see “Pepp’s Pig” on screens.
Some fans were not impressed at all, because they did not sleep until the morning to watch the fights.
One Twitter fan called the change to a children’s cartoon “a sick joke.”
“There was a state ruling that for 6 a.m. this content was inappropriate, so they had to switch to children’s programs,” said Dave Schwarz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked why it happened.
"Yes, "Pepp's Pig".
Bellator President Scott Cocker said they plan to make a schedule so that in the future the fights can also be watched by viewers from the UK.
“As for re-showing, I think we can solve that,” Cocker says.
But there is a Sunday at six o’clock in the morning, and we will not be able to solve this issue until Sunday at our time, and for them it will already be Monday.
But we will do our best.
Believe me, when the broadcast was changed, a lot of text messages were scattered, and all of them were far from friendly in nature.
We tried to solve this problem right away, we thought it was some kind of technical failure.
It turned out that no, it was a matter of state importance.
I promise you, next time it won't happen.
We will reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we usually do, and for the fans we try to increase that number, but it turned out to be an exaggeration.
Yeah, it didn't work out well."
<0xE2><0x86><0x90> Desert Island Discs: Tom Daly has a feeling of inadequacy due to his sexual orientation
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling worse than anyone because of his sexuality, but that’s what gave him the motivation to be successful.
The 24-year-old athlete said he did not understand that “not everyone is like him” until he went to high school.
Speaking on Lauren Laverne’s first program, Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, he said she spoke out about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that winning the Olympics started to worry him less after he had a child.
The permanent host of the long-running show Kirsty Young took a few months off due to illness.
Dale, who played the main guest on Laverne, said he felt "more trivial than any of his peers" because his sexual orientation was considered unacceptable to society, both for boys and girls.
He says: “To date, these feelings of inadequacy and inadequacy have been quite real, but they have given me strength and I have been able to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something meant” so as not to disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexual orientation.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became a well-known LGBT activist and, in his performance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year, called on countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he expressed his opinion because he was lucky that he was able to live an open life, without consequences, and wanted to give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said his feelings for the man, American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, “catch him by surprise.”
Last year, Daley married an Oscar winner, who is 20 years his senior, but claims the age difference was never a problem.
“If so much is going on in your life at such a young age,” he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, it’s hard to find a peer who would have the same radically opposite life experience.
The couple became parents in June, they had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daly said that “his whole worldview” had changed.
“If you asked me last year, it would be all about ‘I need to win a gold medal,’” he said.
“But you know, there are things more important than Olympic gold medals.
“My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daly said his father did not want to accept that he was dying, and one of his last requests was to get tickets to the first row of the London 2012 competition.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Dad, you won’t be around then, and you won’t be able to sit there in the front row,’” Dale says.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was only when he actually stopped breathing that I finally realized he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daly participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
“I just knew that this is what I’ve been dreaming of all my life – diving in front of a crowd of compatriots at the Olympics – there wasn’t a better feeling,” he says.
It also inspired him to pick his first favorite song – Proud by Heather Small – which helped him prepare for the Olympics and still likes it so much.
Desert Island Discs, BBC Radio 4, Sunday, 11:15 a.m.
Michelson, who is not in shape, spent this Saturday the Ryder Cup on the bench
The American Phil Mikkelson will set a record on Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to tighten his form to avoid an unpleasant milestone.
Michaelson, who played at the Biennale for the record 12th time, was sent by Captain Jim Furic to the bench on Saturday for four balls and fours.
Instead of being at the center of events, as was often the case in the United States, a five-time big winner divided his day between watching the game and working on his own game on the field in the hope of fixing what bothered him.
Having never had the most direct hit, even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old athlete is not the ideal candidate for the hard course of Le Golf National, where a long raft usually punishes for inaccurate hits.
And if the course itself is not scary enough, Mikkelson will meet the exact British Open champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth match on Sunday, who teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who lost four points in 12 singles matches make a fiery start, Mikkelson’s match may prove decisive.
Feric expressed confidence in his partner, though, what else he could have said.
“He fully understood the role assigned to him today, kicked me on the back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” commented Feric.
“He’s pretty confident in himself.
He’s a walking Hall of Fame, and he’s done so much for these teams both in the past and this week.
I probably didn’t think he’d play two games.
I had hoped for more, but that’s how it was, and that’s how we decided to go.
He wants to be there, with everyone.”
On Sunday, Michaelson will break Nick Foldo's record for the number of matches in the Ryder Cup.
This could mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which never matched the heights of his individual record.
Mikkelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Feric said his presence had brought considerable benefit to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to feed people, and he’s a great guy who’s interesting,” he explained.
“I think the young players had a lot of fun with him this week and it was interesting to see.
His game is much more than just a game.”
The captain of the European team Thomas Björn knows that a great advantage may soon disappear
Thomas Björn, the captain of the European team, knows from his experience that significant single-league leadership in the Ryder Cup can easily turn out to be unfavorable.
The Dutchman made his debut in the match in Walderram in 1997, where the team led by Severiano Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but overcame the finish line just a little bit ahead with the smallest difference of 13–1, 14 wins.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a big advantage in Walderram 10; we had a big advantage in Brooklyn where we lost, and in Walderram where we won, but only for now,” said Bjorn, who shot the account in a photo, after viewing the Class of 2018, with the Golf.
So history will prove to me and to the whole team that this is not the end.
Tomorrow you'll be full.
Go and do it right.
Until the glasses are displayed on the board – nothing is finished yet.
We have a goal, and this is a chance to win the trophy, and that is what we need to focus on.
“I didn’t say a word, focusing on the 12 players on our team, but we know what we’re up against is the biggest players in the world.”
Satisfied with how his players performed on an uncomfortable golf course for them, Bjorn added: “I would never have surpassed myself in this.
Tomorrow we will have another test.
Tomorrow is the beginning of the individual speeches, and this is a completely different matter.
It’s always nice to be with your partner when things are going well, but when you’re there alone, you’re feeling all the power of a professional golfer.
It is this idea that needs to be inspired by the players, so that tomorrow itself will be full.
Now the partner is left behind, and he has to make every effort.”
Unlike Bjorn, his rival, Jim Ferick, believes that his players will perform better individually than with partners, except for Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Feric himself went through all this carousel of the last few days, becoming part of the winning team in Brooklyn before finally losing when Europe held the Miracle in Medina.
“I remember every damn word about it,” he said in response to a question about how Ben Cranshaw, the captain in 1999, brought his players together before the last day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you’d like to finish it all faster, like in Brooklyn, like in Medina.
When the initiative moves in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We built our game plan accordingly and set the guys up the way we thought they were right, you know? Tomorrow we'll try to do a miracle."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the resistance by meeting Rory McKillroy in a top-flight match with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ayian Polter, as well as other European players from the top of the tournament.
“I’ve chosen that group of guys, and in that order, because I think that’s how they’re going to cover up all possible flaws,” Bjorn said, commenting on his choice of individual players.
The commissioning of a new German warship has been postponed.
The newest frigate of the German fleet was due to be put into service in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War-era warships, but this will not happen even less next year due to malfunctioning systems and avalanche-like cost growth, local media reported.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the brand new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, the newspaper Die Zeit reports, citing a military representative.
The ship was due to join the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery complicated the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships, commissioned by the navy in 2007, will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
As far as we know, they will have a powerful gun, a lot of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies — such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer service periods – there should be the ability to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years away from home ports.
However, the constant postponement of commissioning means that the most modern warships, which are said to allow Germany to spread its power abroad, are already obsolete by the time they enter service, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned the ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited a number of critical "software and hardware defects" that made the warship useless when used in combat.
The software flaws were particularly critical, as Baden-Württemberg-class ships would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors — only half of the workforce on old Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it turned out that the ship is too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to implement upgrades in the future.
It is believed that the 7000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice as heavy as the ships of the same class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty equipment, the cost of the entire project, including team training, also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) compared to the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of holding the newest frigates on anchor are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings about a reduction in Germany’s naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defense committee of the German parliament, admitted that the naval forces are in fact "ending stockpile of ships capable of deployment."
The official said the problem had worsened over time because the old ships had been decommissioned but had not been given the vessels to replace.
He observed that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could ever be taken into service by the navy.
The National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
A new study, conducted in one of the Scottish Highlands, aims to show how bats use the landscape in search of food.
It is to be hoped that the data obtained will allow a new look at the behavior of unique winged mammals and will help in further activities to preserve the species.
The study, organized by scientists from the National Foundation of Scotland, will study ordinary non-pearls, non-pearls sopranos, as well as brown longhaired bats and Dobanton nightingales inhabiting Inverewe Gardens, Wester Ross.
Special loggers will be installed at some points around the site to track the actions of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys of the site using manual detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of screaming, as well as the types of activities for which different groups of these animals are responsible.
A habitat map will then be compiled and a report prepared to create a detailed picture of their behavior on a landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, NTS’s nature conservation adviser, hopes these results will show which habitats are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the main areas of work on habitat management, such as meadow formation, as well as ways to maintain forests in a state optimal for bats and other related species.
Populations of bats in Scotland and across the UK have declined significantly over the past century.
They are in danger of disappearing due to construction and development works that affect their habitat and the loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting installations can pose a danger, as well as flies adhesive tape, chemical processing of building materials, and the hunting of domestic cats.
In reality, bats are not blind.
However, their night hunting habits are such that their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to accurately identify obstacles in the way of flight.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the issue of bat populations very seriously.
The organization employs ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, field checks, and sometimes rescue work.
The organisation has even created Scotland’s first and only reserve of bats at the Threeave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight out of ten species of Scottish bats.
Real estate manager David Thompson says the estate is the perfect territory for them.
“Here at Threave is a great place for bats,” he says.
“There are old buildings, lots of old trees and all the elements of a good living environment.
But much about bats remains unknown, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need for a prosperous existence.”
He recalled the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance in private homes, as the unintentional destruction of one nest could lead to the death of up to 400 females and young individuals, and possibly even to the destruction of the entire local population.
Flying mice are protected by law, their destruction, grazing or destruction of their habitats is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish Fleet Conservation Fund officer, is calling on the public to help.
She says, “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we just don’t know how many individual species live in them.”
Ronaldo denies rape charges, and his lawyers are going to sue for a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo denies the charges of rape against him, calling them “fake news” and claiming that people simply “want to get pissed off” by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Spiegel, which published the accusations against the footballer.
Forward of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mayorga, which allegedly took place in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to talk about the incident, the Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in an Instagram video, in which the footballer has 142 million followers, hours after the accusations were made, 33-year-old Ronaldo called this information “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is all fake news,” claims the five-time winner of the Ballon d’Or on camera.
“They just want to get pissed off using my name.
It's okay.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that’s just part of their work.
I am a happy person and everything is fine with me,” adds the athlete with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue the Spiegel on charges they called “unacceptable information about suspicions in the area of confidentiality,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Shertz said the player intends to claim compensation for “moral damage to the extent appropriate to the seriousness of the legal violation, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.”
It is alleged that the alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player’s room, where he allegedly raped her in anal form, according to documents filed in Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo fell on his knees in front of her and told her that he was “99 percent a good guy, but spooked by one percent.”
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but it was by mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that she turned to the police, and in the hospital pictures of her injuries were taken, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she felt “fear that she would be avenged” and feared “public humiliation.”
The 34-year-old woman says she is now trying to change her place of residence as she continues to experience traumatic feelings as a result of the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was going to join Real Madrid from Manchester United during the alleged attack, but this summer switched to Italian giants Juve in a deal of 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK ‘will regret the car manufacturers lost forever’
Business and Entrepreneurship Minister Greg Clark said the UK would “forever regret it” if it lost its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit.
He also commented on the information that Toyota UK told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it will temporarily halt production at its plant in Bernaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” says Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said the consequences of delays at the border in the absence of a Brexit deal could result in job losses.
The plant in Bernaston produces Toyota Auris and Avensis, and last year it produced almost 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I believe that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will stop,” said Marvin Cook, managing director of Toyota in Bernaston.
Other carmakers in the UK have voiced concerns about leaving the EU without an international trade deal, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close the Mini plant in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are that, according to automakers, in the absence of a Brexit deal, supply chains will be put at great risk.
Toyota’s production line is launched “on time” and parts for custom-made cars are delivered by UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be failures at the border, which, according to industry representatives, could lead to delays and a shortage of spare parts.
According to the company, Toyota will not be able to store stocks at its plant in Derbyshire for more than one day, and therefore production will be halted.
Mr Clark said May’s plan for future relations with the EU, echoed in the Chequers, was “precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks.”
“We need a deal. We want to make the best deal, which will allow, I repeat, not only to achieve success at the moment, but also to take advantage of this opportunity in the future,” he said on BBC Radio 4’s Today.
“Not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers claim that we must be absolutely able to continue successful supply chains.”
Toyota could not specify when production would be stopped, but warned in the longer term that additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately lead to fewer jobs.
Peter Tsuvallaris, who has worked in Bernaston for 24 years and is the head of the union of the plant, says the concern of the members of the organization is growing: “In my experience, if we lose these jobs, we will not be able to get them back.”
A government spokesman said: “We have developed an accurate and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump’s responsible meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “deferred to another week” as the fight for Brett Kavanaugh’s candidacy for the Supreme Court continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia’s interference in the election, ties between Trump’s aides and Russia, and potential impediments to justice from the president.
Whether Trump will dismiss the deputy attorney general, thereby jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, has caused a lot of speculation in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed using the wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of impeaching the president using the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denies this information.
However, on Monday, he reportedly went to the White House to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would “prefer not” to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee at which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christina Blasy Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation into the FBI’s complaints about Kavanaugh, which further delayed a full vote in the Senate.
Trump’s spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, spoke on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date of this meeting has not yet been set, possibly that of this week, and perhaps that it will be postponed for another week, taking into account all the other events taking place in the Supreme Court.”
But let’s see, and I always prefer to keep the press informed.”
Some journalists dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a briefing at the White House since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders says the lack of briefings was not caused by a “rejection of the community” of television reporters, though she added, “I won’t deny that they’re playing to the public.”
She offered to increase the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press.
“The president holds more meetings answering questions from journalists than any other president before him,” she added, without giving precise figures, “we have those numbers.”
Sanders said the briefings would continue, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it’s much better than talking to me.”
We try to do this as often as possible, and you know how many meetings we’ve had in the last few weeks, and if you can talk directly to the president of the United States, it’s a worthy replacement for press briefings.”
Trump regularly answers questions, leaving the White House, participating in open meetings or press conferences with senior officials.
Conferences exclusively for the press are a rarity.
The president’s frivolous, and sometimes bizarre, behavior in front of reporters this week in New York may be the answer to why this is so.
Minister of Health addresses EU workers in Scotland with a letter about concerns about Brexit
The health minister has appealed to EU staff working at the Scottish NHS to express gratitude for the country’s wealth and wish them to remain in their post after Brexit.
Gene Freeman, MSP, addressed this letter to employees less than six months before Britain’s departure from the EU.
The Scottish government has already made a commitment to cover the cost of issuing status applications for EU citizens working in its public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman writes: “During the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU on the issue of exit have continued, and this autumn the expected decision should be made.
However, the UK government is also stepping up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why, right now, I want to emphasize once again how much I value the contribution of every employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we really want you to stay here.”
Christian Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery for a head injury
Michael Organ of Tennessee reported that Tennessee State Tigers midfielder Christian Abercrombie underwent an emergency operation, injuring his head on Saturday after defeating 31–27 in a game with Vanderbilt Commodores.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury was sustained shortly before the break.
“He went out to the sideline and just collapsed there,” Reed said.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before putting it on the stretcher and taking it for a medical examination.
A Tennessee state official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had undergone surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “as yet there are no details about the type/degree of injury,” and in Tennessee are trying to find out when the injury occurred.
For Abercrombie, who only entered the second round, it was the first season for Tennessee State after moving out of the state of Illinois.
On Saturday, before leaving the game, he successfully intercepted five balls, which amounted to 18 balls per season.
Foreign buyers will pay a higher coat of arms fee when buying real estate in the UK.
Under Tori’s new plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher coat of arms fee when buying real estate in the UK, and the extra cash raised will be used to help the homeless.
This step will nullify the results of Corbyn's attempts to attract young voters
An increased coat of arms fee will be charged to those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year in favour of homeless people.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher coat of arms fee when buying real estate in the UK, and the extra money raised will be used to help the homeless - Teresa May will announce today.
This move will nullify the results of Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters, who promises to make housing more affordable and raise citizens’ incomes.
The increase in the coat-of-arms fee will be charged to individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional funds thus raised should stimulate the government's efforts to provide assistance to homeless citizens.
The surcharge on the existing coat of arms, including the increase introduced two years ago for the purchase of secondary housing and rental housing, may amount to up to three per cent.
The Treasury expects this step to bring in up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of new London properties are purchased by non-British residents, which leads to higher prices and makes it difficult for buyers buying their first home to improve their housing conditions later.
Many elite areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become “ghost cities” due to the large number of foreign buyers who, having bought housing here, spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy was developed a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the coat of arms to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction firms of bullying real estate prices by acquiring land but not actually using it, and urged Ms May to abandon quotas on affordable housing to fix the “shameful housing situation” in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn announced a number of proposed positive housing reforms that would include the control of rents and the cessation of unreasonable evictions.
He also wants to give local authorities more powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said I had dedicated my premiership to fulfilling the British dream of making life better with each new generation.
And this, among other things, means solving problems in our housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build life here.
However, it is unfair that for people who are not UK citizens, as well as for foreign companies, the purchase of real estate is as affordable as for hardworking Britons.
For too many people the dream of buying their own home has become too far away, and the threat of being on the street for some is too real.
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to rule Scotland”
Sunderland club boss Jack Ross says his “final goal” is to become Scotland’s manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotsman enjoys the revival of the Northeastern club, which currently holds third place in the first league, separating from the championship by three points.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I got a B cap, that’s all,” Ross Sportssound told BBC Scotland.
“But I grew up watching Scotland with my father in Hampshire as a child, and it always drew me back.
However, it will only be possible if I can become a successful manager of the club.”
Ross' predecessors, Sunderland's managers were also Dick Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Allardays, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic manager says he hadn’t been afraid of such reputable names in such large clubs, having previously abandoned Barnsley and Ipswich Town’s bids.
"For me, the success at the moment will depend on whether I can bring this club back to the Premier League.
In terms of its structure and capabilities, this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League,” said the coach.
“To take him there is not an easy task, but I will think that I have done my job, only if I can get the club back.”
Ross has only been a manager for three years, first becoming an assistant manager at Dumbarton, then spending 15 months at Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa rise from the third level and took St Mirren from the bottom positions in the championship winners the following season.
Ross claims that today he feels more comfortable than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was probably a real crossroads,” he recalls his responsible work at Alloa.
“I honestly believed that management was better for me than a game.
It sounds strange because I did everything well, made a good profit in this position and achieved some success.
But the game is more difficult.
There are a lot of things to do weekly.
I still feel stress at work, but I feel good in the managerial position.
I’ve always wanted to lead, and now, by doing so, I feel more comfortable as a fish in the water throughout my adult life.”
You can listen to the full interview on Sportsound on Sunday, September 30, on the Scottish radio from 12:00 to 13:00 English summer time.
According to the results of the survey, 17:30 — the perfect time for pint of beer
The summer heat led to increased sales of British pubs, but lowered sales in restaurant chains.
According to statistics, sales in pubs and bars rose by 2.7% in July, and in restaurants fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin of the CGA business consulting company, which received this statistic, says: “Prolonged solar activity, as well as longer than expected, England’s participation in the World Cup means that July continued the trend of the previous month, June, when sales in pubs increased by 2.8%.
The June decline in restaurant revenues by 1.8% also continued in July.
Pubs and bars selling liquor showed much higher results comparable in restaurants.
Pubs selling only food also suffered from the heat of the sun, although not as much as restaurants.
There is a feeling that people want to jump out onto the street only to miss a glass.
Sales of drinks in pubs and bars grew by 6.6% in a month, and food by 3%.
Paul Newman, RSM’s leisure and hospitality analyst, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales in the non-residential market.
It is not surprising that restaurant chains continue to experience difficulties, especially since the drop in annual sales by 4.8 percent will be particularly painful due to the ongoing price pressure.
The long hot summer has never been better for food operators, and it is not yet the fact that August, bringing more moderate temperatures, will give much needed rest.
Overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including reopenings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand turnover.
Coffer Peach Tracker’s industry sales monitoring of the British pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyzes performance data from 47 networks with a total turnover of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is a recognized industry benchmark.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
According to the survey, one in five children – some of them only 11 years old – have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found the growth of pages of “fake institutes”
This news has heightened concerns about sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they have a “core” account that parents know about
However, one in five children – some of them only 11 years old – creates social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found a rapid growth in the number of fake “insta” accounts — that is, Instagram, a site for sharing photos.
This news has heightened concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they have a basic, “clean” account that their parents have access to, but they also have secret accounts.
One mother, who accidentally gained access to her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account, stumbled upon a teenager there who urged others to “rape him.”
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent School Directors Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 have two social media profiles, with half admitting that one of them is usually secret.
HMC Head Mike Buchanan says, “Many teens are striving to create online spaces that are inaccessible to their parents and teachers, and that’s an alarming fact.”
Eilid Doyle will become the "voice of athletes" of Scottish athletics
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Eilid Doyle was elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics as an Supervisory Member of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is Scotland’s most titled athlete in athletics. Chairman Ian Beatty argues that this step is a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to take advantage of the extensive experience of the athlete at the international level in the last decade.
"Eylid has tremendous respect in the Scottish, British and global athletic community, and we are confident that her participation will bring great benefits to athletics in Scotland," he said.
Doyle said: “I aspire to be the voice of the athletes and hope that I can really make a good contribution and contribute to the development of the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, has a total of four Olympic gold medals, and now works as a regular commentator on the BBC, after a stroke he lost his ability to walk.
He tweeted: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I have lost the ability to move.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will recover, and if so, to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but I completely recovered, learned to walk again and today I do exercises on agility!
Thank you so much for your support!”
Advertising of a vacuum cleaner, in which breastfeeding mothers were compared to cows, shared the opinions of Internet users
A dairy company has sparked controversy online by posting an advertisement where breastfeeding mothers are compared to dairy cows.
Released “the world’s first noiseless breast pump,” consumer technology company Elvie has released an advertising music video demonstrating the freedom that the new breast pump provides to breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a haystack to a music track that says, “Yes, I feed my own milk, but you won’t see my tail” and “If you haven’t noticed, it’s not a faggot, it’s my breast.”
And then the choir goes on to say, “We suck, we suck, we breastfeed our babies, we suck, we suck.”
This ad, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, sparked controversy on the Internet.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments: The video received ambiguous response from viewers, with many saying it sheds light on the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
“It’s a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, except that their children are taken away from them within a few days after birth,” writes one user.

Another comment: “It is clear that this is equally traumatic for both mothers and children.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a milk vacuum for mothers who leave their children to themselves?”
Another user adds: “Advertising is disconnected from reality.”
Others, on the contrary, defended the video, and one woman even wrote that the song was “just great.”
“I think that’s a great idea.
If I were to feed a baby, I would definitely buy one.
Breastfeeding actually made me feel like a cow.
Advertising, of course, is a bit crazy, but that’s how it feels.
It’s a great product,” one user wrote.
And another comment: “An ad designed for moms who breastfeed (often they do it right at their workplaces or in the toilets) and who, in fact, feel a little ‘cow’.
This advertising is not meant to praise or blaspheme our dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women shows that they were all dancing with these invisible milk suckers hidden under their bras.
The concept of this advertising campaign is based on the fact that many breastfeeding women say they feel like cows.
In fact, the Elvie vacuum cleaner is absolutely imperceptible, has no wires or tubes, is freely placed in a feeding bra, and is unobtrusive, giving women the opportunity to move, keep babies and even go outside while feeding.
Ana Balarin, Mother’s Early Childhood Partner and Specialist, commented: “The Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserves bold and provocative advertising.
By paralleling women and dairy cows, we wanted to bring breastfeeding and all its problems to the forefront, while jokingly and cheerfully demonstrating the incredible sense of freedom that the new milk sucker provides.
This isn’t the first time Elvie has been on the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the podium of designer Martha Yakubovskaya, using this product for the purpose.
Hundreds of migrant children move unimpeded to tent camp on Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to accommodate children with custodians.
Typically, most sponsors themselves are the same immigrants who do not have documents, and are afraid to endanger their stay in the country by taking custody of the child.
The risk rose in June when federal authorities announced that potential custodians and other adult members of their families would have to provide fingerprints, and that the data would be passed on to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer, testified in Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had requested the custody of the unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had not been previously convicted.
“About 80 percent of those who are either custodians or members of their families are in the country illegally, and a significant proportion of them are foreigners who have committed the crime.
Therefore, we continue to persecute these individuals,” Albens said.
In an effort to speed up the process of designing children, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear before the court within a month of detention, rather than 60 days, as was previously the case.
To declare their legal status to the judge on immigration cases, many of them are present on video, not in person.
Those who are deemed not eligible for assistance will be deported quickly.
According to shelter workers and information that has appeared in the system in recent months, the longer children remain in prison, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to outbreaks of violence or attempts to escape.
Lawyers say these problems are intensifying in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where signs that the child is experiencing difficulties are more likely to be ignored because of the size of the institution.
They add that transporting children to tent camps without giving them time emotionally to prepare or say goodbye to friends can aggravate the trauma many of them are already struggling with.
Syria orders U.S., French and Turkish “occupation forces” to withdraw troops immediately
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the country has been at war for the eighth year.
Mualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and “will be treated accordingly.”
“They should leave immediately and without any conditions,” he told the gathering.
Mualem insists that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions of people have been driven out of their homes, “the war on terrorism is almost over.”
He said that Damascus would continue to “lead this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories” of terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has deployed about 2,000 troops in Syria, who are mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
The French contingent has more than 1,000 troops in a war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Mualem said good conditions had been created for their return, and accused “some Western countries” of “spreading irrational fears” that prompted refugees to stay outside the country.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to promote the return of citizens,” he said.
“They politicize what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union are warning that Syria will not be given reconstruction assistance until a political agreement on an end to the war is reached between Assad and the opposition.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last major stronghold of the Idlib rebels has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, home to three million people.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement had a “clear deadline” and expressed hope that military action would be directed against the jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra front, who “will be destroyed.”
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of the new committee, which will include representatives of the government and opposition, will be convened in the near future to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying the commission’s work should be limited to “reviewing articles of the current constitution,” and warned of interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
Following this logic, Mr. Trump will win re-election in 2020 if impeachment and scandal do not prematurely end his presidency, which is what many liberal spectators are likely to hope for.
And this will undoubtedly be “the most dramatic presidential finale in history!”
At the moment, there are no signs of tired viewers.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have more than doubled — to 1.05 million on CNN and almost three times — to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime time viewers, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” surpassed cable ratings, gathering 3.5 million viewers from screens in the evenings during the main news show.
“It’s a fire that people are drawn to because it’s beyond our understanding,” says Neil Beer, director of ABC’s Nominee Survivor, about a cabinet member who becomes president after the Capitol is destroyed as a result of the attack.
Nell Scowell, a long-published comedy writer and author of Just Funny: A Few Unpleasant Truths About Penetrating the Hollywood Boys' Club, proposes another theory.
She recalls how she once took a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
He replied, “Yes, because he’s funny!” said Ms. Scowell.
There's something valuable in all this chaos - it's fun.
Of course, unlike all the other content broadcast on television, the storylines of Washington’s events can determine the future of Roe v Wade and answer questions about the possibility of reuniting immigrant families and the health of the world economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, when you watch for the sixth hour in a row, a group of experts discuss the use of Bob Woodward’s “deep background” for his book “Fear,” or about Paul Manafort’s jacket for $15,000 in ostrich leather (the clothing is already warmed by pride”).
I’ll never look at Super Mario again with the same eyes.
“Part of his job is to make us feel like the reality show is to feed you something every night,” says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about the changing cast of Trump’s show and the daily twists and turns of the show.
You can’t afford to miss an episode, or you’re hopelessly behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleas this week, it was 27 degrees warm on the northern shore of Kauai, the sun was shining, but he was hiding inside his house and watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not break away from the screen, at least not exactly when showing how Brett Cavanaugh appears before the Senate Legal Committee and decides the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows, people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleas said.
“I still thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Outsider money is pouring into the most brutal midterm elections that the White House is leading
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania’s 17th District receives cash flow from a change of counties in Congress in which two officials compete for the same seat.
This suburb of Pittsburgh, whose geography has not been changed so long ago, supports a Democrat, a member of the House of Representatives Connor Lamb, who won a seat in another district in an extraordinary election last spring.
Lamb is opposing another acting official, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is significantly intersecting with the new 17th.
The maps were revised after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that as a result of election fraud, the old areas were attributed to Republicans in violation of the constitution.
The race in the new 17th district sparked a heated debate about funding campaigns between the main party’s financial forces – the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Campaign National Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name came to prominence in Pennsylvania after a small victory in the March special election to Congress in Pennsylvania's 18th district.
This place has been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district, gaining 20 points.
Political experts give the Democrats a small advantage.
The U.S. punished El Salvador for supporting China, but then withdrew
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, which provoked a negative reaction from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with the President of Panama Juan Carlos Varela. He was also in Panama until the partners evicted the management team of the Trump organization.
U.S. State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over “recent decisions to deny Taiwan recognition,” U.S. Department of State spokeswoman Heather Nauert said earlier this month.
However, the possibility of punishment was only considered for El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug control, economic development and support.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for this Central American country with its high unemployment and homicide rates.
In the context of regular internal meetings, representatives of North and Central America postponed the high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which was to be held to summarize the outcome of a similar meeting held last year, which was perceived as a step forward in efforts to prevent conflict.
However, by mid-September, senior administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the preparations for the conference to continue, and had effectively stopped consideration of El Salvador's punishment.
According to diplomats, the conference is scheduled for mid-October, and Vice President Mike Pence will speak at it in a sign that the administration attaches real importance to this meeting.
Three U.S. diplomats have safely returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without taking any new tough messages or sanctions with them from Washington.
Mr. Bolton, a White House official, declined to comment on the details of the debates, which were shared by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss domestic issues on condition of anonymity.
Their reports are confirmed by a third-party analyst, who is part of the administration, but also spoke on terms of anonymity.
Study the history
The next step could be a message from Special Counsel Robert Mueller about a possible impediment to Mr. Trump’s justice, as there is currently very substantial evidence in the public records.
Mr. Mueller is reportedly also beginning an investigation into the facts of the Trump campaign’s collusion with Russia and its attacks during the last election.
If Congress changes the host, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in this body, just as he is preparing to speak again to voters, and perhaps eventually to jurors from among his peers.
But there is a lot of “if”; I don’t want to say that Mr. Trump’s fall is inevitable, as is the fall of his equivalents in Europe.
We will all make choices on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup d'état and overthrow Hitler, and this would have happened if the West had resisted him and supported Czechoslovak troops in Munich.
However, we did not do this and missed the opportunity to avoid subsequent years of bloodshed.
The course of history unfolds at precisely such points, and the relentless march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are experiencing some of these pivotal moments right now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult situation since, according to the newspaper, last year he proposed to make secret records of the president’s activities and discussed his unfitness for office.
Mr. Rosenstein argues that the Times data is incorrect.
“How will we react if the recently requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or true, or if he is still upheld as a Supreme Court Justice despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote for Congress in the medium term, which will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these tests properly, this winter will be too long for democracy.
But I believe that we will be able to go through them with dignity thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime whose officials once occupied the embassy, in which I lived many years later.
She survived, immigrated to America and 60 years later led me to light Saturday candles on a table with a swastika symbol.
With such a family past, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrance of the Rangers is optimistic in the run-up to a clash with the Vienna-based football club Rapid.
The Rangers will host Vienna's Rapid on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain over Villarreal earlier this month, will allow them to take strong positions in Group G of the Europa League.
The knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrance from making his first appearance in the season with a 2:2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a springboard to achieve great results.
“It was a good moment for us because Villarreal are a good team,” the 31-year-old said.
“We got into the game, thinking we could get something, and we left with nobody.
Maybe, in the end, we could do it, but in general, nobody was probably a fair result.
They probably played better in the first half, and our success came in the second half, where we showed ourselves better.
There will be another big European night this Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, but it will be a difficult game because they showed a good result in their last game, but given the support of the fans, I am sure we can move forward and get a positive result.
“Last year was definitely tough, given everything that has to do with my injuries and replacements at the club itself, but now there’s a good factor in this place.
The composition is well chosen, and the guys really get pleasure from it; the training went on "hours".
I hope we can move forward, leave last season behind and be successful.”
Women lose their sleep due to fear of retirement savings.
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few spoke about it with their family members.
About half of the people who participated in the nationwide study said they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
However, only 10% said they had spoken about it with their children.
“People want to be cared for by family members, but they’re not trying to discuss it with them,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
And you have to start with that.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family for what they’re likely to have to take care of you if you don’t voice your wishes in advance.
Discuss with your counselor and family where and how you will get medical care, as this choice can be an important cost factor.
Consult your financial advisor: he will help you develop a plan to pay for these expenses.
Your choice of financing for long-term care may be covered by a traditional long-term care insurance policy or a mixed life money insurance policy that will help cover these expenses or insure yourself with your own property provided you have the money.
Put your legal documents in order: get rid of the legal battles.
Build up your health care credentials and appoint a trusted person to supervise your health care and ensure that specialists fulfill your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
We also recommend considering the possibility of establishing financial credibility.
You should choose a trusted person who will help you make financial decisions and monitor the payment of your bills in case you find yourself incapable.
Do not forget about the little things: imagine that your elderly parent needed urgent medical care, and he is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to provide information about what drugs he is taking and what he is allergic to?
Write down all these details on paper to prepare for the eventuality.
Martin adds: “It’s not just the availability of finances, it’s also the choice of doctors.”
“What medications do you take?
Who will take care of your dog?
Write down and write down this plan.”
In Ilfracombe, a man shot several times from a pneumatic rifle
The man shot several times from a pneumatic rifle, returning home from a party.
The victim, who had been shot in the chest, stomach and arm for 40 years, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon.
Police described the shooting, which took place at approximately 2:30 a.m. in English summer time, as “accidental.”
The victim did not see the attacker.
The injuries are not life-threatening, the police are currently looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
Officials said at least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to the outage of communications, rescuers can not get any information from Donggal, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a force of 7.5 points.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated as a result of the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 (data for 2017).
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when an earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a district that stretches along 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, an administrative district smaller than the province, in 2017 numbered 299,200 people.
Fishing and agriculture are the basis of the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, and in particular the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important for the province's economy, but is mainly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency, over the past 100 years, tsunamis have wreaked havoc on Palu and Donggal several times.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
The tsunami also occurred in the western part of Donggal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Volcanic Ring of Fire and regularly suffers from earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A severe earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, causing a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 occurred in the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-point earthquake occurred on one of the Mentawai islands near Sumatra, triggering a tsunami up to 10 meters, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake struck Pidi Jaya district in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people remembered the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time the tsunami did not occur, but more than 100 people died as a result of the destruction of buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists temporarily remained under the ruins.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Trac Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
The 29-year-old Palin from Vassilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering in a domestic violence situation, and for resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to a police report, when one of his acquaintances tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he took her phone.
According to KTUU, Palin is in Mat-Su detention facility and will be released on bail for $500.
He appeared in court on Saturday, and when asked if he was guilty, he declared his “unequivocal innocence.”
Palin is threatened with three Class A petty crimes, which means he can be deprived of his liberty for up to one year and fined $250,000.
He has also been charged with a Class B crime punishable by imprisonment for up to one day and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police, reporting the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, forgery of a report of domestic violence, and possession of weapons in a state of alcoholic intoxication in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016 after explaining her son’s cruel behavior to a post-traumatic stress disorder allegedly obtained as a result of his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
An earthquake of 7.5 points caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are not working, and in the coming days the number of victims will increase.
The earthquake occurred near central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There are videos of the incident on social media.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
U.S. Attorney’s Office Wants to Sentence Suspect to Rare Death Sentence in New York City
The federal prosecutor's office in New York is seeking the death penalty for Saifullo Saipov, a suspect in the New York terror attack that killed eight people - a rare federal punishment for a federal crime that has not been used in the state since 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov allegedly rented a Home Depot truck to attack a bike path on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, shooting down pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “deliberately” killed eight people and “deliberately” inflicted serious bodily harm, according to a notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, on these two charges, a death sentence may be issued.
A few weeks after the attack, a grand federal jury read out Saipov’s indictment of 22 counts, which included eight counts of murder for the purpose of racketeering commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges of violence and destruction.
According to prosecutors, the attack was “carefully planned and deliberate”, Saipov carried out it, as described, “in a disgusting, cruel and criminal way”.
"Saifullo Habibullaevich Saipov caused injuries, caused damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelina, Nikolas Kleves, Ann-Lor Dekadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlie, Erna Ferrucci, Erna.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been 10 years since the prosecutor in the Southern District of New York demanded the death penalty for the crime.
In September 2009, defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison.
The last time the death penalty in a federal case in New York was applied in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed for conspiring to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed using an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse after his attack.
Police said he told investigators he was glad he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by watching a video of ISIS on his phone.
He also asked to hang the flag of ISIS in his hospital room, police said.
He denies his guilt on all 22 counts of indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders on Saipov’s side, said they were “clearly disappointed” by the prosecutor’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to use the death penalty rather than life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only aggravate the pain of these events for all of their participants,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense had earlier appealed to prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
MEP from Tori says NIJJEL FARAJ should not be responsible for Brexit negotiations
Today, during a protest at the conference, Tori Nigel Farage vowed to “mobilize the people’s army.”
The former UKIP leader said politicians should "feel the pressure" of Eurosceptics, as one member of parliament, Theresa May, suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Party member Peter Bowen said at a rally in Birmingham that the UK would already be “out” if Mr Farage was Brexit secretary.
However, the problem Mrs May faces in trying to reconcile her deeply divided ranks is compounded by the fact that members of the Tory Party, who are opposed to leaving the EU, join a separate protest against Brexit that is taking place in the city.
The prime minister is trying his best to preserve his compromise plan, voiced in Chequers in the midst of attacks by Brexit supporters, his opponents and the EU.
The Allies insist that it continue to try to make a deal with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and thus force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and “chaos.”
Mr. Bowen said at a Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to “ beat the Chequers.”
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be levelled and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was responsible, we would have come out already,” he said.
Wellingborough added: “I will continue to stand for Brexit, but we need to beat the Checkers.”
Speaking against the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be dependent.
We want to establish our laws in our country.”
Mr. Bowen rejected the assumption that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely untrue.”
Tory party Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins was also at the rally, giving reporters such a comment: “I say: Prime Minister, just listen to the people.”
“Checkers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for this plan, it is also unpopular with members of our party and our activists who are actually storming the streets and electing us in the first place.
Please put the Chequers aside and start listening to what they're telling you."
In her harsh address to Ms. May, she added: “The Prime Ministers remain at work if they remain true to their promises.”
Mr Farage said that if politicians are going to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum, then they need to be forced to “feel pressure.”
“It’s now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he says.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them, ‘We’re not going to get it out of your hands.’”
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of Brexit betrayal, to feel the pressure.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that gave us the victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we become an independent, independent and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, opponents of Brexit marched through Birmingham, then held a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Several activists waved “Tories against Brexit” posters this weekend.
At the opening of the conference, Labour Party member Lord Adonis criticized the Conservatives for security issues in their party’s mobile app.
“And these people claim that they can set up Canada plus plus IT systems and technology, to work at the borders, for free trade without borders with Ireland,” he added.
“This is a complete farce.
There is no good Brexit in principle,” he said.
Warren plans to “carefully study” the possibility of participating in the presidential race
U.S. House of Representatives Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November election, she will “carefully study the possibilities of running for president.”
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat on Saturday spoke about her future at a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running in November for re-election against Republican Party member Jeff Dil, who was co-chair of Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
There is talk that she has a chance to take over the post of Trump in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon, she held another meeting with voters in Hollywood; since Trump took office, it has been her 36th meeting with voters in the format of a town hall meeting.
One of the participants asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren said it was time for “women to go to Washington to ‘fix’ our broken government, and for that to happen, there needs to be a woman upstairs.”
As a result of the murder of Sims (convicted), the LSU player was arrested
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police said on Saturday that the suspect in the murder (shooting) of LSU basketball player Wade Sims, which occurred on Friday, was arrested.
At 11:00 a.m. at a press conference, Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20 years old.
On Friday, the police department released a video of the shooting, asking to help identify the person who was filmed.
A 20-year-old Sims was shot dead near the University of the South campus on Friday morning.
“Wade Sims was shot in the head and killed,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday.
Wade pleaded for his friend, and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to being involved in the incident, carrying a gun and shooting at Wade Sims.
During the arrest, Simpson did not resist and was taken into custody by the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
A young man 1 m 82 cm tall grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starts last season and scored an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 selections per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after team tactics gave him a victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since Valtteri Bottas passed the qualifying on Saturday, overtaking Lewis Hamilton, it has become clear that Mercedes’ team tactics will play a major role in the race.
Already from the pole position, Bottas started well and practically hung on Hamilton, when he defended his position on the first two turns, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to go to the pit stop, leaving Hamilton to weave in the tail of the entire group – a choice that became decisive.
"Mercedes" went to the pit stop one lap later, and then came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton, after some "wheel-to-wheel" fight, pulled forward, which led to the fact that the driver of Ferrari reluctantly left the interior space to protect the rear of the three-wheeler free, risking a run.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstappen started from the back row of the grid and was in seventh place by the end of the first round.
He then drove most of the race, clinging to his home tires, aiming to finish quickly, pushing Kimi Rykkonen to fourth place.
In the end, he went to the pit stop on the 44th lap, but was unable to increase the pace on the remaining eight lap, as Rykkonen took fourth place.
The day turned out to be a difficult one, as Valtteri did a fantastic job on the weekend and showed real nobility by sharing it with me.
The team did such an exceptional job to have a couple of tricks in stock,” Hamilton said.
Traitor's language of gestures
President Donald Trump criticized Senator Diane Feinstein at a meeting with voters on Saturday for her claim that she did not disclose a letter from Christina Blaise Ford accusing Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford’s testimony before the Senate Legal Committee, saying what was happening in the Senate showed that participants in these events were “deceptive, ugly, and lying people.”
“The only possible reaction to all of this, and what’s going on in the last few days in the Senate is fine, it’s anger, anger, disgust and lies,” he said.
“You see all these leaks, and then they say, ‘No, I didn’t do that.
I didn't do that."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you "send" the information?
Do you remember her answer... did you “send” the document’s information? – “What, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't sink.
All right, stop.
“No, we didn’t,” he added with the senator’s intonation.
In July, Feinstein was sent a letter detailing the allegations made by Ford against Kavanaugh, and in early September it was illegally made public, but Feinstein denies that the leak occurred in her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, but I didn’t leak her information,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep this information a secret, and I did as she asked.”
However, the manner in which she denied the leaked accusations seems to have disliked the president, who commented on it during Saturday’s rally: “Here’s what I’m going to tell you: body language has deceived her.
She may not have “smelled,” but her body language was the worst I’ve ever seen.
Continuing to defend his candidate for the post of Supreme Judge, whom the three women accused of sexual harassment, the president suggested that the Democrats were using these accusations for their own purposes.
“They are definitely trying to regain power in all available ways.
We see the ugliness, the disgust, they don’t care who they offend, who they have to step through to gain power and control,” he said.
British elite hockey league: Dandy Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants in a game against Dandy
In the Elite Hockey League game, the Dandi Stars paid off for Friday's defeat to the Belfast Giants, winning a rematch on Saturday with a score of 5-3 in favor of Dandi.
The Giants got an early two-goal lead thanks to the hits of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Boviller.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Coney raised the level of the home team before Dwyer brought the Giants to the top.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bushard compared Dandy's score before Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's two goals secured their victory.
For the people of Adam Keefe, who beat Dandy 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night, it was the third defeat in the Elite League season.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two sides, when the Giants won three previous games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 after Kendall McFall's goal with the support of David Rutherford, after which Boviller doubled the lead four minutes later.
During the initial period, Sullivan brought the hosts back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Markwardt helped Coney settle the score at 15:16.
Dwayer made sure the Giants intercepted the initiative in the first break when he scored a second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The hosts regrouped, and Bushar again equalized the score, scoring a goal with a numerical overweight of 27:37.
Coney and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dandi the opportunity to take the lead for the first time for the match at the end of the second period, after which he and his team consolidated the victory, keeping rivals in the middle of the field until the end of the final period.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, are heading to Milton Keynes for the next game on Friday.
The air traffic controller was killed so that hundreds of people on board the plane could avoid an earthquake.
The Indonesian air traffic controller was posthumously awarded the title of a hero after he deliberately went to his death in order that the plane with hundreds of passengers could safely take off.
More than 800 people were killed and many missing as a result of a strong earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday that caused the tsunami.
Strong underground impulses continue to destroy this area, many residents of Palu have found themselves under the wreckage of buildings.
Despite his colleagues fleeing to save his life, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post at the horribly swinging control tower of Mutiara Cess Al Jufri Airport, the city of Palu.
It remained in place to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was at the time on the runway, was able to take off safely.
Then, when it seemed to him that the tower was collapsing, he jumped off it.
He later died in the hospital.
Indonesian air navigation spokesman Johannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian news agency ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to deliver it to a large hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, the dispatcher died before the helicopter had landed in Palu.
“We are very sorry for this loss,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll from the earthquake could reach thousands because, according to the disaster relief agency, access to the cities of Donggal, Sigi and Butong is limited.
“The number of victims is likely to be increasing as large numbers of people are still under the wreckage, and many have never been able to get out,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves, which reached six meters high, have devastated the city of Palu, where a mass burial of the dead will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are delivering humanitarian aid to the affected city.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, tells Sky News: “Emergency care comes every minute.
Clean water is lacking.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don’t know they will be there.
The tragedy has already taken on quite a serious scale, but it could be much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Vidodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country’s armed forces, saying, “I ask all of you to work day and night to carry out all the tasks related to evacuation.
“Are you ready?” said CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia Air Crash: Air Niugini Now Reports One Man Missing After Plane Crashes in Lagoon
The airline, which carried out the flight that crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, now reports that one person was missing, while it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew safely left the sinking plane.
An Air Niugini report said that as of Saturday afternoon, she had no information about one male passenger.
The airline said it was collaborating with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to find the man.
The airline was not able to respond immediately to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local sailors helped rescue the other passengers and crew of the plane after it crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline also reported that on Saturday, six passengers were hospitalized, and all of them are in stable condition.
The causes of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy claim that the plane landed in the lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses claim that the plane was unable to land on the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes says that the plane began to enter the runway too low.
“And that’s very good,” adds Janes.
Janes said that he and other passengers managed to pass to the emergency exits on the sinking plane, as the water level was around the belt.
He also said the stewardesses were panicking and screaming on board, and that he had a mild head injury.
The U.S. Navy reports that the sailors repairing the nearby docks also helped rescue using an inflatable boat on which they brought people ashore before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet).
Flight safety data shows that over the past two decades, 111 people have died in plane crashes involving PNG-registered airlines, but none of these crashes have been related to Air Niugini.
Intelligence analyst was able to prove the fact of burning a woman alive
On Saturday, the indictment brought a case against a man accused of burning a Mississippi resident in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett gave multi-hour testimony as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told members of the department how he used cell phone recordings to compile a general picture of the actions of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones; according to this data, that night Tellis spent time with Chambers, which contradicts his previous testimony, reports The Clarion Ledger.
He said that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, but according to the data received, his mobile phone was near Chambers; when the circumstance became clear, the police interrogated Sanford.
In his testimony, Sanford stated that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked Sanford if Tellis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in Sanford’s truck that night, Sanford said that “it’s a lie because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he met Chambers two weeks before her death.
However, according to phone records, they only called for one week.
Rowlett also showed that some time after Chambers Tellis’ death, she deleted her text messages, calls and contact information from her phone.
“He wiped her out of his life,” Hale says.
The defense should begin to present its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is “Aware Hip-Hop”?
The hip-hop trio is going to fight the negative attitude to this genre, filling their music with positive content.
The High Breed of Bristol argues that the content of hip-hop has changed, departing from the original political and social problems.
The band members want to go back to their roots and make “conscious” hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently witnessed a resurgence in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?
New York babysitter sues couple for racist texting
A New York babysitter sued a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message from a woman complaining that the babysitter was “one more black” that the woman mistakenly sent to the babysitter instead of her husband.
The spouses deny that they are racist, claiming that the lawsuit was filed with the “purpose of extortion.”
Lancey Plasco-Flexman, the mother of two, expressed concern when she learned that the new babysitter offered by the childcare service, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to the family for her first day of work in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
However, instead of sending a text message to her husband, she twice mistakenly sent it to Miss Morris.
Realizing her flaws, the “confused” Plasco-Flexman fired Maurice, saying in the service that the nanny, who turned out to be an African-American, was doing her job poorly, and that they were expecting a Filipina, not an African-American, the New York Post reported.
Morris was paid for a day’s work and then sent home on Uber.
Morris is now suing a married couple and seeking compensation for dismissal in the amount of $350 a day for six months — under the terms of the original oral agreement, which, however, were not stipulated by any contract.
“I want them to understand that such things are unacceptable,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “And I know it’s discrimination.”
The spouses disagree with the accusation of racism, and claim that the dismissal of Maurice can be considered a reasonable step, since, if she were offended, they would no longer be able to trust her.
“My wife sent her a message that she didn’t really mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” her husband, Joe Plasco, told The Post.
“But would you trust your children to someone you were rude to, even if you were rude, not wanting to?
Would you trust your newborn baby?
Come on, you!"
Calling the lawsuit “extortion,” Plasco said his wife gave birth to a child just two months ago and found herself in a “very difficult situation.”
“And are you ready to persecute a man who finds himself in this position?
It’s not very nice of you,” added a bank employee who specializes in investing.
The trial is still ongoing, but public opinion has already made its verdict on social media, accusing the couple of unacceptable behavior and problems with logic.
Paddington publishers fear readers won’t understand the move with the talking bear, says new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted by the publisher, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the work for the first time, even before it is published.
It’s very funny to know that Paddington is a huge success.”
She also said that her father, before he decided to write a children's book about the bear, worked as an operator for the BBC, and would be optimistic about the refusal to publish it, and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of his books was "both joyous and bitter" because last year they were published.
As for Paddington’s own bear, she refers to him as “a very important member of our family” and that her father was quietly proud that his character eventually gained fame.
“He was a quiet and humble man,” his daughter says.
Paddington was so real to him, and to his father it was almost as if his own child had achieved success: he was proud of them, although he did not really consider this success to be his own merit.
I think he treated Paddington's success that way.
Paddington was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, but he also always paid tribute to the bear himself.”
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
After the plane landed, her daughter was taken to the Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“He called me regularly and said that everything was really bad, that something went wrong,” says Mrs. Ednan-Laperuza.
“Then he called again and said that she would die within the next two minutes and that we had to say goodbye.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, darling.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The drugs that doctors gave her, forcing her heart to work, gradually stopped working, leaving her body.
She died sooner than expected.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing it was coming to an end.
I couldn’t cry or cry or cry because there were other people around me, other families.
I had to hold myself tightly.”
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuza, saddened by the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, accepting the enormous loss she had just had to endure.
“Nobody around knew what had happened,” she says.
“My head fell, I didn’t stop crying.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I experienced this all-absorbing feeling of sympathy for Nadu.
He needed my love and support so much.
I know how much he loved her.”
Women who have suffered the loss of loved ones, prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who committed suicide try to prevent others from taking this step.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey place cards on the Welsh Bridge with comforting words and phone numbers that people can turn to for support.
Mrs. Davis Tyler’s son was 13 years old when he began depression, and at the age of 18 he committed suicide.
“I don’t want other parents to feel the same way I do every day,” she says.
45-year-old Davis, living in Leeds, says her son was a great chef and had a damn charming smile.
“Everyone loved his smile.
Everyone said that when he smiled, it was as if the light was on in the room.”
However, before his death, he left his job because he was going through really bad times.”
This happened in 2014, and the deceased Tyler was found by his brother, who was then 11 years old.
Mrs. Davis says, “I don’t stop fearing that there will be a chain reaction.”
Mrs. Davis invented these postcards, “so that people would know that there is someone to turn to and tell everything, even if it’s your friend.
You can’t sit and be silent, you have to talk to people.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, has lost Mark, her husband, with whom she has lived for 15 years — he was gone shortly after the death of his mother.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed, upset, or anything like that,” she says.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
At Christmas, he got particularly sick: he didn’t even look at the children when they opened their presents.”
She says that his death was a huge trauma for them, but they have to go through this, this event shocked our family.
It tore her apart.
But we must continue to live and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance: FBI begins investigation
“I thought if we could get something like what he asked for — an investigation limited in time and scope — we could bring at least a little unity,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would “break up” against the backdrop of a growing party skepticism.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Time is the reason for their hesitation.
The midterm elections will take place in just five weeks, on November 6, and if — as expected — everything goes badly for the Republicans, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to get the person they want and elect him as the country’s supreme judge.
George W. Bush is calling the senators, lobbying for the support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who had been working at the White House for Mr. Bush, and who had met his future wife Ashley, who was then Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI releases its report?
A vote will be held in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Cavanaugh will be able to win at least 50 votes in a Senate session, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to resolve the issue of vote equality and confirm his candidacy for the post of Chief Justice.
The number of North Korean refugees has declined under Kim.
Since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined, a South Korean lawmaker said.
According to data from the Ministry of the South, the number of escapees dropped to 1,127 last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Pak said that the key factors were tighter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as higher rates charged by smugglers exporting people.
Pyongyang does not make any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean fugitives are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most people run through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than a secure demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views migrants as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often subjects them to forced repatriation.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to resume the stalled nuclear disarmament talks.
This came after the June historic meeting of U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, at which they reached general agreements on disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho accused the United States of obstructing progress on the issue with its sanctions.
“If we don’t have at least the slightest confidence in the United States, we also don’t have confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will in no way be able to unilaterally begin disarmament,” Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and claims he’s not fit to work in the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, a minority leader in the House of Representatives, called Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, "hysterical" and said he was unfit for the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made this comment in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but think that if a woman ever allowed herself to behave in this way, she would be immediately called ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony in the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s accusations of sexual harassment, which allegedly occurred when they were both still teenagers.
Kavanaugh was quite emotional, sometimes even screaming and suffocating, talking about his family and school years.
He also unequivocally condemned the committee’s Democrats, calling the accusations against him “a grotesque and clearly planned assassination of an actor” organized by liberals outraged that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi also said that, in her opinion, Kavanaugh's testimony only confirmed that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he has biased attitudes towards Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself by his claims, as well as by how he attacks the Clintons and the Democrats,” she says.
Pelosi was outraged when asked if she would try to bring Kavanaugh to justice if his guilt was confirmed and if the Democrats would get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“If he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s not fit for the Supreme Court, and he’s not fit for the court he’s in now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a D.C. District Court of Appeals judge.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions regarding the Affordable Care Act or "Roe v. Wade" because he was considered a representative of conservative justice.
At the hearings on his candidacy, Kavanaugh sided with the question of whether he would overturn some Supreme Court decisions.
“Now is not the time to let the hysterical and biased man take the post of Supreme Judge and at the same time shout, ‘How wonderful!’” says Pelosi.
And women should own it.
It's righteous anger, months and years of rage, it can't go through it without tears.
“When we get angry, we cry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s that unusual anymore, do you?”
She continued: "I was really helped by a woman who worked somewhere in a managerial position. She told me that she was crying when she was angry, but she developed a technique by which she explained to her interlocutor: "You can think I'm crying because I'm upset.
I'm actually angry."
And then she just kept talking.
I was very impressed with this approach.”
Tears are resolved as a way out of anger in part because they are fundamentally misinterpreted.
One of my most painful memories of my first job in a male-dominated office: I once cried in anger, but I was grabbed by a shiver by an old woman, a soulless manager whom I had always been terribly afraid of, and dragged to a stairwell.
“Never let them see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re crying out for anger.
They think you’re upset, and they’re happy to think they’ve finally brought you in.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential election.
In 1987, Mr. Hart was caught in some non-serious intrigue and left the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason to prevent her from running for president.
“This decision was not properly considered,” she admitted to me with a smile 30 years later.
“Seven other candidates were already in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called that case "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
The campaign was already coming to an end, it was lagging behind in fundraising, and so she vowed not to participate in the race unless she raised $2 million.
It seemed to be a completely losing option.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, offered her only $250.
“I’m an extortionist, aren’t I?” she wondered.
When she made the speech, announcing that she would not run an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions — gratitude from the people who supported her, disappointment from the system that made it so difficult to raise money and access voters, and anger at gender discrimination, she admitted.
“You would think I had a nervous breakdown,” recalls Mrs. Schroeder of how the press reacted to her.
“You might have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I was still thinking, what would they write on my monument?
“She was crying endlessly.”
How a trade war with America could be useful for Beijing
Experts believe the first salvos of a trade war between the US and China have been overwhelming, and while the battle is still far from over, a split between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long run.
U.S. President Donald Trump made the first warning earlier this year, taxing major Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation took place this week when new tariffs hit $200 billion worth of goods, effectively taxing half of all goods coming to the US from China.
Beijing has each inflicted equivalent retaliatory strikes, recently imposing tariffs on U.S. goods worth $60 billion in the amount of five to ten percent.
China has promised that retaliatory measures against the US will be equal each time, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to start experiencing at least the slightest difficulty in the near future.
To force Washington to back down is to back down, but to publicly back down would be too shameful for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, according to experts, if Beijing is able to play its cards correctly, the pressure of the US trade war could provide long-term support to China, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a fast-paced political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to an economic stumbling block in any of these countries is actually much more dangerous than previously acknowledged by observers,” says Abigail Grace, a researcher at the Center for American Security.
Foreign Minister says Syria is “ready” for refugees to return
Syria declares that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees, and appeals for help in the reconstruction of a country that has been devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said conditions were improving in the country.
“Today, the situation on the ground has become more stable and safe thanks to successes in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists so that people can live there in peace.
All conditions have now been created for the voluntary return of refugees to a country they had to leave because of terrorist attacks and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime would be grateful for its help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that the country would not accept aid under any conditions or assistance from countries sponsoring terrorism.
Europe secures victory at the Rider's Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Rider's Cup, defeating the US team with a final score of 16.5-10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The U.S. has already lost six times in a row on European soil, and the European Rider’s Cup has not won since 1993.
Europe regained the crown thanks to the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, who scored the 14.5 points they needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mikkelson, who fought hard most of the tournament, made his first long-distance shot into the water at the 16th hole par-3, conceding his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won in all his rounds, becoming the 1–4 players who ever went 5–0–0, since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spit suffered a 5:4 defeat by the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen from Denmark.
One of the best players in the world, Dustin Johnson, gave up 2:1 to Jan Polter from England, who may have participated in the Ryder Cup last time.
Spaniard Sergio Garcia, a veteran of the eight Ryder Cups, was the winner of the tournament in the history of Europe with 25.5 points per career.
“I usually don’t cry, but I can’t stand it today.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy to get the cup again.
It’s all about the team and I’m glad I was able to help,” says emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who on Sunday won the American golf legend Tiger Woods with a score of 2:1 in a single game.
“I’m incredibly proud of this victory — I grew up watching Tiger Woods play,” says 23-year-old Ram.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3.
These figures are quite odd for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, beating only Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team fought all weekend, trying in vain to succeed. The exception was Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed top-class golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furick said after his team's disappointing performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we managed to shake Europe a little bit.
It didn't work.
We take off our hats in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with PGA America and our Rider’s Cup Committee, and we will move forward in achieving success.
I love all 12 guys, and I am proud to be their captain.
We need to be able to lose.
We lost.”
Red tide: news Microorganism concentrations decreased in Pinellas, Manati and Sarasota
The latest report of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decrease in red tide concentrations in parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, in the districts of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, abundant flowering is reported, which indicates a decrease in the concentration of microorganisms.
The Red Tide extends approximately 130 miles of coastline from the northern Pinell to the southern districts of Lee.
The fires can be seen about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsboro County, but compared to last week, their number has decreased significantly.
A red tide is also observed in Pasco County.
Last week, the county reported an average concentration in and near Pinellas County, from low to high concentrations in the coastal area of Hillsboro County, high concentrations in Manati and Sarasota counties and in the coastal areas, an average concentration in the county of Chartelot.
In Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties, there is still a possibility of respiratory irritation.
In northwestern Florida, the probability was not reported last week.
