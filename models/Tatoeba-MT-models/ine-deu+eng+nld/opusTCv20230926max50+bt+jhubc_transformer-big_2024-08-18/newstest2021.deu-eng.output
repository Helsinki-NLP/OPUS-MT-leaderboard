Biker reacts lightning fast and prevents worse
On Friday evening, a traffic accident occurred on the road between Machtolsheim and Merklingen, in which a motorcyclist was only slightly injured thanks to his quick reaction.
Driver ignores biker
A 44-year-old driver wanted to turn left on the Landstraße 1230 towards Machtolsheim at around 9.30 pm with her VW from Merklingen.
In doing so, she oversaw the 24-year-old motorcyclist coming from the direction of Nellingen.
In the event of a collision, hand and foot brake levers fly away
The biker was still trying to evade the car, but still streaked it at the rear of the vehicle.
The hand and foot brake levers were torn off at the Suzuki and the driver was no longer able to brake.
In the spirit present, he drove his motorcycle into the green strips next to the roadway and let it roll out there without falling.
Biker suffers leg injury
Due to the collision with the car, the biker still suffered an injury to the leg and had to be treated in a clinic.
Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvest helpers infected
After a corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in Lower Bavarian Mamming, almost 500 people are under quarantine and are no longer allowed to leave the operation.
A security service monitors the exit ban.
A total of 174 harvest workers were tested positive for the coronavirus pathogen Sars-CoV-2 during the series investigation, as the Dingolfing-Landau Land Office announced on Saturday evening.
"In order to avoid further spread, we unfortunately need to take this step to protect the population," said Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had already been infected in the operation - this was the reason for the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and red beets - but the cucumbers only for pots.
Mamming is a rural community with well over 3,300 inhabitants not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to keep quiet: "According to our information, this is a closed circle of people".
In the yard, infected were separated from uninfected employees, the site is now surrounded by a fence.
The Greens and the SPD gave the state government co-responsibility.
The two opposition factions accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting the control of the housing of seasonal workers.
"This can be bitterly avenged if such local infections occur and regional lockdowns have to be ordered," said Jürgen Mistol, the Greens' parliamentary director.
“After the coronavirus outbreak in the Wiesenhof-Schlachthof in mid-May, we have already demanded a special control program for farms with harvesters,” said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"It is precisely the hygienic conditions at the workplace and the living conditions that must be tightly controlled from our point of view.
That obviously didn't happen."
The outbreak came “with an announcement.”
Aidenbachstraße Metro Station: Dangerous dispute: 19-year-old falls into the track bed after Schubser
In a fight between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstraße subway station, a 19-year-old fell through a pusher and crashed into the track bed.
Obersendling - At the Aidenbachstraße subway station around 4.15 p.m. on Friday, a dispute broke out between two youth groups.
A passerby alerted the police, who came forward with several stripes.
According to initial investigations, a Munich man (17) pushed a 19-year-old man to the ground.
The young man slipped over the sidewalk and fell into the track bed.
People from the group of the 17-year-old helped the fallen man climb the track.
There was no danger from an incoming train.
According to the police, there were clashes between the two.
The 17-year-old fled the scene, but his personalities could be traced back.
Accompanied by his father, he went to the police inspectorate 29.
The 17-year-old is being investigated for a personal injury.
Report: Seehofer urges longer storage of data
The storage of data is currently suspended.
Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer, however, calls for an extension of the storage period, according to a media report.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer (CSU) is calling for an extended storage of data - instead of the planned ten weeks, a half-year.
Seehofer's Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) asked in a letter for a quick change to the law.
Seehofer therefore wants to strengthen measures against child abuse.
He believes it makes sense to “make urgently needed adjustments to the law already now,” the newspaper quoted the letter as saying.
The storage of data is currently suspended.
A decision of the ECJ is expected.
Seehofer, however, wants the amendments to be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, the report continues.
A spokesman for the Justice Ministry told the newspaper that it could only be meaningfully examined whether legal adjustments were needed if the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the interior ministers of the countries, had already spoken out in June for a storage of data.
NBA: Clippers star Lou Williams gets strip club upset
Excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams, 33, a Los Angeles Clippers basketball pro, is reported to have left the tournament district of Disney World in Orlando/Florida with permission for a funeral.
However, according to U.S. media reports, he still visited the strip club "Magic City" in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who is said to have admitted the visit, is back in Isloation, being tested daily for Covid-19.
His reason for visiting: Chicken Wings.
In February last year, "Sweet Lou", as he is called in the NBA, has already expressed his love for exactly these wings.
The American wrote, "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, N.D.) have the best wings in the city."
NBA insider Shams Charania announced on Twitter on Sunday that the NBA Williams has ordered a ten-day quarantine.
This means that the Clippers-Star misses the first two official games after the test game phase.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to play at the end of the Corona season.
Currently, the top 22 teams are preparing for the season finale with training matches starting on Friday night.
Söder speaks out about mass infection to the Corona situation
Munich - Health Minister Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced a test substance campaign for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in the district of Dingolfing-Landau has alarmed authorities and politicians.
Nearly 500 harvest workers from several countries are currently working on the large vegetable farm, with over a third having been infected with the coronavirus.
The farm is now under quarantine and is locked with a building fence.
No one is allowed to leave the premises, food is delivered.
The authorities now offer free corona tests to the well over 3,300 residents of the municipality.
Since the harvest workers had little contact with the local population, the Landratamt so far assumes that the infections have not spread beyond the yard.
"Conscience Bites": Confession of the alleged firefighter of Nantes
“My client has been cooperative,” lawyer Quentin Chabert told the newspaper.
The defender added: "He regrets the actions very much, the confession was a liberation for him."
His mandate was "plundered by bites of conscience and taken very seriously by the extent of the destruction".
In the event of a conviction, according to prosecutors, the man faces ten years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The Gothic St. Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes was badly damaged in a fire on Saturday night last week.
The fire broke out in three places far apart in the church.
Laboratory investigations hardened the suspicion of arson.
The suspect had already been arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released after a day.
The man works as a volunteer for the Diocese of Nantes and was responsible for the closure of the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no sign of a violent intrusion into the church, he quickly fell into the eye of the investigators.
Discuss the abolition of the 50+1 rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended that the 50+1 rule be abolished.
“German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates completed facts,” Grindel said in a statement.
He stressed: "For the clubs that are most likely to be dangerous to Bayern and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules do not work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, it is not possible to get around the debate about whether it is not necessary to facilitate the involvement of investors by associations that want to break into this phalanx".
However, he has doubts about whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority participations that are prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rule.
"There remains a legal risk of pulling investment fences around the economic location of the Bundesliga in a European single market," Grindel said.
The former DFB head sees the danger that "attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but will not lead to more tension in the championship".
Even an equal distribution of TV money will not have a decisive effect.
"FC Bayern makes a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
So the differences are already immense among the first three clubs alone.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of 130 million," the 58-year-old said.
Looking at the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who have noticed this mistake and pierced the press instead of addressing me," Grindel said of the adoption of an expensive watch that led to his resignation in April 2019.
“It’s been very busy for me humanly.”
He had received the gift worth about 11,000 euros from a Ukrainian official.
“I committed a compliance violation, and it was right to draw the consequences,” Grindel said.
"With the ominous gift of a watch, I have been completely transparent and unbiased.
A lot of people in the DFB knew about it.”
He never “made a hole out of the gift,” the 58-year-old assured.
"That may be called naive, at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption".
"Black Lives Matter": Injured and a Dead Man
The protests against police violence in the United States have re-emerged through Donald Trump’s deployment of federal police officers in several cities.
On Saturday, clashes broke out between protesters and police in various cities.
Three people were injured in Louisville and 16 people were arrested in Seattle.
In Austin, one person was shot dead while a demonstration train was crossing a crossroads.
Previously, there had been clashes in Portland during protests against racism and police violence.
Security forces, including federal police officials, used tear gas on Saturday night and forcibly dispersed demonstrators.
Hundreds of partially armed demonstrators marched through Louisville, Kentucky, Saturday demanding that those responsible for Breonna Taylor’s death be held accountable.
The 26-year-old student was shot dead in a drug raid in her Louisville apartment in March.
The target of the raid was someone else who did not live there at all, and no drugs were found either.
When a member of a group that describes itself as an armed alliance of black Americans fired a shot on Saturday, three people were injured.
According to NBC, they were taken to the hospital.
None of them were in danger of death.
The police set up barricades because counter-demonstrators of a white militia had also formed.
In the end, there was no meeting between the two groups.
In Austin, Texas, one person was shot and killed in a "Black Lives Matter" demonstration.
According to the police, a suspect was taken into custody.
No further details of the circumstances of the incident have been given to her so far.
Mayor Steve Adler told the New York Times that he was, like many in the city, “discomfortable and incomprehensible” about what had happened.
Protesters also clashed with police in the U.S. metropolis of Seattle on Saturday.
They set fire to a construction car in front of a youth prison, police used grenades and pepper spray.
According to the Seattle Times, 16 people were arrested for resisting police officers or injuring their bodies.
In Oakland, California, a courthouse was set on fire.
A small group of demonstrators have slammed into windows, shot down fireworks and dazzled police officers with lasers, Oakland police said late Saturday night (local time).
The fire could be extinguished quickly.
In Aurora, a suburb of Denver, Colorado, a car drove through a crowd demonstrating on a highway.
Police said one of the protesters fired a gun and at least one person was injured and taken to hospital.
In addition, windows were also knocked into a courthouse and a fire was set, the police said.
Investigations have been initiated.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes defy Corona
Although the big sauce was missing in the spa town, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the Alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: the Rakoczy weekend without Rakoczy party.
But: Even if the big party mile in the city center was missing, the crowds and program highlights like Saale, Rakoczy ball or festival, many came at their expense with the Corona-compliant alternative program.
"I think we have succeeded in spreading Rakoczy flair," says Sylvie Thormann, the spa director.
The guests would have taken it well.
In principle, we return to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, and only the historical ones were in the focus of the festival.
Pleasant Atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser has been visiting the Rakoczy festival Bad Kissingen with her husband for more than 25 years.
This time, too, in the Corona year.
The couple have made themselves comfortable at the Luitpold Casino, watch the historic ones strolling and listen to Cuban live music at the casino restaurant.
"I find it very pleasant," says Konhäuser.
They do not miss the masses of people who otherwise belong to Rakoczy.
For this, however, you will miss the usual program highlights, especially Saale burns on Friday evening as well as the historic festivities and the final fireworks on Sunday evening.
"That's too bad.
The weather would have been great this year,” she said.
Rakoczy Riding Tournament to be held again
For the actors of the historical spa guests, the alternative program meant in part more work.
For example, for Christina Gold, who participates in the festivities in a normal year and can be seen there on the carriage of the spa garden café.
This year she was walking around the city on Saturdays and Sundays in costume.
"It's already more exhausting, otherwise we'll have it easier," she says.
The equestrian club had less to do, even if individual equestrians were on the go in the park.
"We very much hope that the rider quadrille can be held again next year," says Chairman Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after several years of break 2021, a Rakoczy riding tournament will also take place.
28 Corona cases with Spanish second-tier Fuenlabrada
Spanish footballer CF Fuenlabrada is climbing deeper into the crisis due to a corona outbreak.
Since the newcomer from the vicinity of Madrid, despite the first Corona cases on July 20, flew to a game in the city of A Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, a low blow follows the next.
By Sunday, 28 players or team members had been tested positive, one came to the hospital, the club said.
Fuenlabrada from the town of the same name southwest of Madrid had so far a chance to reach the Ascension Playoffs.
Now even the descent into Group B of the Second League threatens.
The match against Deportivo La Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a last Monday was canceled at the last minute, the prosecutor's office is investigating a possible crime against public health, the top sports authority CSD is considering the forced resignation of the club.
The players and other team members sit in a hotel in quarantine.
"Until the sixth day of the quarantine, they have not received a fresh towel and no gel," the sports newspaper "AS" wrote.
The photos show how players hung underwear and club clothes in their rooms in the hotel for drying after apparently having to wash them themselves.
Also, the bed linen was not changed for five days.
Another problem is the food.
It was neither good nor good enough, wrote "AS".
The club management, on the other hand, said they were satisfied with the hotel.
The accusation of deliberately endangering public health was rejected by the club’s lawyer, Javier Tebas Llanas.
It was not a violation of the Corona rules established by the football association, the son of the president of the Spanish Primera Division, Javier Tebas, emphasized, as reported by the news agency Europa Press and the sports newspaper "Marca".
Before the flight, there were four people infected until July 19, but all of them were isolated and had not travelled with them.
Just before the flight to A Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a on Monday, all players and team members were tested again.
When the team was already in A Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, they were positive with "five or six" other team members of the Corona test.
The game was canceled 60 minutes before the touchdown, Tebas Llanas said.
Police have to capture horses that have been torn out of steam compartments
Two animals were on the road.
The police took her back to her owner.
On Sunday morning just before 6 a.m., a traffic participant reported two free-running horses on the feeder between the inlet of Donnersdorf/Steinsfeld and the Theres motorway junction.
At the arrival of the officials, the horses were already between the feeder and the village steam compartment.
After the officers could gain the confidence of the horses shortly before the steam compartment, they were each able to remove a rope carried in the strip cart.
Cycling professional Tony Martin: career continuation imaginable
Time travel specialist Tony Martin is thinking about a continuation of his career.
Frankfurt/Main - Seven-time time rider Tony Martin can imagine continuing his cycling career.
"I'm just setting the framework with the team, how and in what form it could continue," the 35-year-old told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung.
Martin is currently employed by the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had considered ending his career after this year before the Corona break.
Negotiations with his team are also about the number of race days, he said.
Or other problems that would plague him as a family father, Martin said.
Earlier he had risen after a fall, and the first thought had been: "Quickly back on the bike.
Today, as the father of a little daughter, I think: What if?
The professional cyclist admitted that there are some aspects that he finds increasingly difficult to deal with.
"But it was good for me to remember from the Corona time what I have in cycling and how much fun it is for me".
During the Tour de l'Ain (5 to 9 August), the time-driving specialist will again enter the competition.

Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the meeting is held without spectators.
"We are particularly looking forward to this game.
It’s always nice to come to Frankfurt and meet friends,” Kovac said.
It was an interesting test, the 48-year-old said.
Before moving to FC Bayern Munich, Kovac had trained the Hessians from 2016 to 2018 and led them to victory in the DFB Cup.
"A high-profile opponent like Monaco is a good test for us in terms of the game against Basel.
Like all Frankfurters, I look forward to seeing Niko Kovac again," said one-way coach Adi Hütter.
The 50-year-old Austrian had succeeded the Croat in the unanimity.
In March, the Frankfurters had lost the eighth-final match against Basel in their own stadium with 0:3.

Argentina rejects counter-offer of creditors
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Buenos Aires announced on Saturday.
"This would not only be irresponsible, but also unfair," it said in a statement.
“While 50 percent of children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase our creditors’ short-term gains.”
The debts of the second largest economy in South America are no longer sustainable under the current conditions.
Therefore, Argentina is calling on its private creditors to waive some of their claims of around $66 billion (about $59 billion).
If there is no agreement, the country is again threatened with bankruptcy.
It would be the ninth default in Argentine history.
Recently, lenders had demanded higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
The Argentine government, however, is sticking to its latest offer and is not ready for any further concessions.
Argentina is in a serious financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate last year was more than 50 percent.
For the current year, experts expect a decline in economic power of around ten percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had not paid interest claims amounting to $503 million, resulting in a limited default.
Arrived professionally - not yet privately
"It's going super well" - this conclusion is drawn by Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days at the notariat in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: in mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will succeed Lutz Feller at the Eggenfelder Notariatsstelle.
Already six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctoral lawyer took on the job, the normal daily business is already on full tours.
"However, I still have to arrive privately," she explains in conversation with the rottaler indicator and laughs.
Of course, the short lead-time was not enough to move the food center from Regensburg completely to Eggenfelden, reports the native Dingolfinger.
Currently, she and her husband, who works in Regensburg as a judge in the regional court, are looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city.
At least her husband could still apply for short-term parental leave in order to ensure the care of the two daughters (31<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 and 11<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 years old).
In order not to have to commute from Regensburg every day, she also has an overnight stay with her parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
Growing up in the neighbouring country, the city of Eggenfelden has long been a concept for her.
When she visited the area with her family in recent months, she once again stated: "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town".
All the more pleased she was that she had made the race for the vacancy in the selection process.
In Dr. Stefanie Kramer’s professional career, her homeland of Lower Bavaria also plays a central role: after studying law in Passau, she completed her term as a referee and the 2nd state exam in Regensburg.
After several posts as a notary, among others in Rehau and Hof in Oberfranken, Babenhausen in the Unterallgäu and Regensburg - during this time she also took up her doctorate in employment law - she took her first place as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016, she went on maternity leave, followed by the move to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken over representation services in various notarial offices.
When the job in Eggenfelden was tendered due to the imminent retirement of Lutz Feller, she saw the right time for a full career re-entry, explains the 39-year-old.
The team of her predecessor, who will take over the holiday representation in the notarial office in the future, has completely taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer - and immediately has a praise for the team of the law firm ready: "It's going super well!"
The fact that she can rely on recorded processes here makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of the private food point.
She has already made contact with a local institution regarding kindergarten and nursery places.
And if everything works out as desired, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here soon - and get to know the most beautiful jogging routes of the Red Valley.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be filled to 20 percent at the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
"Due to the distance regulation, which is mandatory, we are planning according to the current situation with 12,000 to 15,000 spectators," Dortmund's managing director Carsten Cramer told the "Daily Mirror".
Normally, the arena in the district city holds just over 81,000 spectators at Bundesliga games.
In the ghost games caused by the Corona pandemic last season, BVB lost around four million euros per game.
Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitalisation and internationalisation at the BVB, hopes that in addition to the normal spectator seats, some of the approximately 4,000 places in the hospitality sector can be opened again: "It is of course a blow to the office if these revenues completely break away".
In the face of the ongoing Corona crisis, everyone is currently "good advice to take a stable side length for the first time".
“If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people are in short-time work in Germany alone, then the need for entertainment is limited,” Cramer said.
The Dortmund marketing chief praised the BVB professionals for their pay cut, which is intended to help overcome the crisis: "Of course, players know that their pay cut has a different effect than if we put 100 people working in merchandising on short work."
Tiny Miracles: Early Start with a Few Hundred Grams
Hardly heavier than a packerl butter, just three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The Bub is one of around 400 young children who are cared for annually at the Grazer Kinderklinik.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few — like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael — are extreme lightweights with not even a kilogram of birth weight.
They are so small and so early born that neither lungs, nor intestines, nor muscles are fully trained.
Your skin is sometimes so delicate that it could damage the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothes and specially made mini-windows for them.
But not so small that they wouldn’t be by voice – “and how,” Berndt Urlesberger sniffs.
"Even if, of course, they don't scream quite as loudly as big babies".
When the whiteboard becomes the stage
Despite Corona Theater in the classroom: The Whiteboard as a stage experienced the 9th grades of St. Jacob's High School in Abtsgmünd just before the holiday began.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the Theater of the City of Aalen presented the students with the production "Das Heimatkleid" - by video.
Afterwards, the students were able to exchange the play and the performance via Skype with the actress and director Winfried Tobias.
The idea for the performance format from the current corona situation was born.
Teacher Teresa Nar was delighted with the enrichment of the teaching.
Even if at the end all the participants agreed that the direct encounter in the theater and stage room would offer additional incentives, you can also see the potential for contact in the schools in the theater.
"If we continue to improve the technical framework, this could be an interesting addition to the game operation," said director Winfried Tobias.
First round played: TSV 1860 would meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB-Pokal
Should the TSV 1860 qualify for the DFB Cup, the Lions will meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round.
This resulted in the draw on Sunday.
Munich - Sixty possible opponents in the first round of the DFB Cup are fixed.
The Lions would meet at a successful qualification at Eintracht Frankfurt.
This resulted in the draw on Sunday evening at the ARD-Sportschau.
Because due to the coronavirus pandemic the field of participants is not yet complete, placeholders were used in the draw.
Thanks to the voluntary resignation of semi-finalist FC Memmingen, the TSV 1860 is already in the final of the Bavarian Toto Cup (4th or 5th September).
There the lions meet either the Würzburger Kickers or Viktoria Aschaffenburg.
Should Zweitliga-Aufsteiger Würzburg reach the final, sixty would already qualify for the first round of the DFB Cup.
Otherwise, the Giesingers would have to prevail in the final game against regional league player Aschaffenburg.
The first round of the DFB Cup will be played between 11 and 14 September, one week before the start of the third league.
"Vom winde verweht": film legend Olivia de Havilland is dead
Oscar winner Olivia de Havilland has died.
She died in Paris on Sunday at the age of 104 of a natural death, her spokeswoman for the German Press Agency confirmed.
De Havilland was best known for her role as Melanie Hamilton in the South American film "Vom Winde verweween" (1939).
Born to British parents in Tokyo, Olivia de Havilland moved to California as a toddler.
Austrian playwright Max Reinhardt discovered the 19-year-old in the role of Hermia of Shakespeare's "Summer Night's Dream".
The Warner Brothers film studio contracted them for seven years and brought them out big alongside Eroll Flynn.
She made eight films with the heartbreaker.
In 1946, she won her first Oscar in the lead role of To Each His Own.
The film was released in Germany under the title "Mother's Heart".
Three years later, the award came as the best actress in William Wyler's "The Heiress".
She also received a lot of recognition as a neurotic eccentric in "The Dark Mirror" and "The Snake pit".
Daphne du Maurier proposed her for the lead role in the filming of her novel "My Cousine Rachel" in 1952.
The piece became a worldwide success.
With her longtime friend Bette Davis, she played in “Little Song for a Body.”
From the marriage to the writer Marcus Goodrich (1946 to 1953) the son Benjamin emerged.
In Paris, de Havilland married journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had his daughter Gis<0xC3><0xA8>le with him.
This marriage also broke up.
Rumors about an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath have never been confirmed.
"Road to Timmendorf": Beach volleyball: Thole/Wickler miss final at comeback
The World Cup champions Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed the final at the beach volleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf".
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf, they defeated their national team colleagues Nils Ehlers and Lars Flüggen in the semifinals with 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21).
The last time Thole/Wickler played was last September at the World Tour Final in Rome.
In the final game on the Rhine, their defeaters Ehlers/Flügen against surprise team Lukas Pfretschner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde lost 0:2 (17:21, 17:21).
In addition to the show tournament, three starting places for the German championships were played in Timmendorfer Strand at the beginning of September: Armin Dollinger/Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms/Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretschner/Milan Sievers secured the tickets.
Kalbitz draft from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "fir leaf"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is, from the FDP’s point of view, only a fig leaf and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the right-wing extremists in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of radicals in the AfD," FDP interior politician Benjamin Strasser told the dpa news agency in Berlin.
The Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD on Saturday in Stuttgart after several hours of trial confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Board of Directors had decided by a majority in May.
Kalbitz is the chairman of the AfD faction in the Brandenburg state legislature.
“If the AfD were really about consistently removing right-wing extremists from its party, officials like Björn Höcke and his supporters would have been long excluded,” Strasser said.
"But there is no political will in the AfD because right-wing extremism is now part of the party."
Similarly, CSU Secretary General Markus Blume said: "That Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded does not say anything and does not change anything," he told the "World on Sunday".
"It speaks volumes, rather, how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist in the middle of the AfD still has".
Bloom predicts that the AfD will again fall below five percent in elections in the future.
"The days of the AfD in parliaments are numbered".
Kalbitz was one of the leaders of the now officially dissolved "wing" around the Thuringian AfD country and faction chairman Björn Höcke; constitutional protection classifies the stranding as a "secured right-wing extremist effort".
In May, the AfD-Boss Kalbitz had thrown out of the party.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz had not indicated a previous membership in the now banned right-wing “Homeland Faithful German Youth” (HDJ) and with the Republicans when he joined the party.
Kalbitz denies membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the left-wing faction in the Brandenburg state legislature, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court does not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf has eaten only chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, with or without Kalbitz".
Neither the Federal Party nor the right wing will be weakened by this decision.
"The Meuthen group's maneuver is transparent.
You want to avoid further observation by the constitutional protection and try to get under the radar," Walter said.
"The AfD won't let go of the ghosts they called.
A draft does not change anything," commented Erik Stohn, SPD general secretary in Brandenburg, on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
"Here the AfD-Landesverband and the faction to this day held their right-wing leader".
The legal dispute over Kalbitz’s membership in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he would now proceed civilly against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.
North Sea wind farms provide 21 percent more electricity
In the first six months of the year, wind turbines on the German North Sea supplied 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity to the grid.
That’s well over 21 percent more than in the same period last year, network operator Tennet in Bayreuth said.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea power to the mainland and the transmission through the German electricity network.
The wind farms on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of Tennet’s network area, have supplied an additional 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, wind power from the North and Baltic Sea thus reaches 13.73 TWh, compared to 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
Wind harvesting at sea accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind flow in Germany; that’s about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms provide higher production capacities
The increased contribution of offshore wind energy is due, in addition to the wind conditions, to higher generation capacities, because new wind farms have been connected to the grid in the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind turbines in the North Sea were all running at full capacity at the same time, they could generate an estimated 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
By 2030, it is expected to rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
“In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion to expand our offshore network connections by then,” said Tim Meyerjürgens, Tennet’s managing director.
In reality, wind farms cannot use their capacity even at sea, but reach about 40 percent.
The previous record day this year is January 2, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
Nearly seven million households could be supplied with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
It was almost a small celebration of the 130th anniversary.
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The exhibition opening "Skirmish" with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold blew up the usual frame after the corona pause.
Much more art friends than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the art association, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent was delivered by the band "Defenders of the Universe" on the southern Kornhausplatz.
To the north of the gallery, the association "Sandtogether" was engaged.
Freital: Windbergfest canceled due to Corona
The Windberg Festival will not take place this year.
The city of Freital has canceled the three-day festival planned in September.
In other years, more than 30,000 people had attended this city festival.
"We really did not make this decision easy and - aware of how difficult it is economically for those involved - hoped until the last minute," said Mayor Uwe Rumberg (Parteilos).
"But ultimately, we are here as organizers responsible for the health of many thousands of people".
Because if tens of thousands had flowed to the festive grounds and into the festive tent, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracking could not have been complied with in accordance with the current Corona Protection Regulation.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that there would not have been much left of a folk festival.
In addition, the organisational and monitoring effort would increase disproportionately by multiples.
Rumberg hoped for next year.
The city of Freital will then celebrate its 100th anniversary with the Winterbergfest from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the Saxony Day from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Dressage Olympian Werth in Achleiten not to be beaten
Achleiten - The six-time Olympic winner Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider in the dressage tournament in the Austrian Achleiten.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg came to four victories in four starts this weekend.
After winning a Grand Prix at the start of the season with gold medals and Quantaz, she was also unable to beat in the Grand Prix Special and the Courier on Sunday.
At the 15-year-old mare Weihegold on Sunday, Werth won a special match against the Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen.
On Saturday, the Germans were on Quantaz clearly ahead of their 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer.
Werth's victorious horse Quantaz belongs to Max-Theurer.
The most successful dressage rider in the world is set to establish the ten-year-old stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz, it was the first cow ever.
Already at the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago, Werth had won all four important exams.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled for August 14-16.
More air traffic controllers in Worms in the future
The Worms University of Applied Sciences continues to expand: the "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" establishes a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and will start in 2021.
With the professorship there is the possibility to allow the start of studies not only in the summer, but also in the winter semester.
This means that twice as many students can be trained as before.
At the same time, the capacities at both the university and the DFS Aviation Academy are evenly loaded.
The DFS will advise the university on the establishment and appointment of the professorship.
Represented at the University since 2019
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students are in the Air Traffic Management program as part of their training as air traffic controllers at Worms University of Applied Sciences.
Nine students have already started this year.
So far the experiences of the DFS are very positive, the achievements of the students are excellent.
The combination of study and lottery training contributes significantly to further increase the attractiveness of the lottery profession.
"In these times, funding is not easy for us economically.
However, we are confident that air traffic will recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to be able to fulfil our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel,” says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman of the Managing Director of the DFS at the signing of the contract.
"For the DFS, the foundation professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, comprehensive knowledge base in the long term.
We therefore continue our good cooperation with the university and at the same time underpin our attractiveness as an employer".
Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of the University of Worms, also emphasizes this: "The foundation professorship forms an important bridge between science and business.
With it, we would like to connect to the already existing cooperation with the DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual bachelor course Air Traffic Management".
At the same time, the German Aviation Authority’s confidence in Worms University is both a motivation and a commitment to further expand its teaching and research expertise in the future fields of aviation.
In the use for the pilots of tomorrow, the university with the first foundation professorship for a dual degree program can set very special highlights and innovative priorities for its students.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, Education and Culture, emphasizes: "The Worms University of Applied Sciences has a unique position in Rhineland-Palatinate with its focus on aviation.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university".
Rescue helicopter lands on the A 45
For about 30 minutes, the A 45 motorway was completely blocked on Saturday afternoon in the direction of Aschaffenburg, as the rescue helicopters were in use after a traffic accident.
A 76-year-old drove straight in the curve with a Ford at 12.40 in the exit Alzenau-Mitte and landed on the dashboard.
As a result of the impact, the front airbags triggered, the driver suffered minor injuries to the face and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old passenger were taken care of by the emergency doctor and the patient was flown to a hospital with the rescue helicopter.
At present, however, the police assume that there is no risk of death.
The damaged vehicle, which suffered damage of about 2000 euros, had to be towed.
Heil wants to examine other industries after meat industry
The Corona crisis once again brought the situation in parts of the meat industry to light.
Law tightening is coming soon.
But they are on the right – and will it stay there?
Federal Minister of Labour Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to review other sectors according to the now planned strict regulations against malfeasance in the meat industry.
"We will look at industry for industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary," Heil told the German news agency in Berlin.
Germany’s employers are already warning against restricting work contracts in general.
After the massive corona outbreak at the Fleischriesen Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet wants to pass a law of salvation on Wednesday.
Large slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to employ foreign personnel in slaughtering, dismantling and meat processing.
For this purpose, the use of factory contract workers and temporary workers there is to be prohibited.
Employer President Ingo Kramer told the DPA: “Finger away from a general restriction of labor contracts and employee leave if you don’t want to completely squander the economy.”
Work contracts, for example, for large areas of the craft industry, the construction industry and the plant construction, are necessarily the basis for their value creation at the customer.
"The faults of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument".
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban factory contracts everywhere in the German economy".
Work contracts make sense.
"If an industrial company commissions a craftsman to install a safety system, this is a very normal factory contract".
The German meat industry considers a ban on factory contracts and temporary work to be unconstitutional in its sector alone.
It is not possible to explain why different labour law should apply to cheese portioning and packaging in the future than to sausage, according to a statement on the draft law, as reported by the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saturday).
In the event of a ban, the consumer price would increase by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product.
Many Eastern European employees from factory contractors worked in the industry according to the results of an audit of the NRW Occupational Safety and Health Administration, partly 16 hours a day.
They often did not have a break.
Salary was retained for protective equipment or rent.
It was also found that the situation in the housing of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively strict law had already entered into force for the meat industry in 2017.
However, these were bypassed by "trick-circle constructions".
"Now needs to be cleaned up fundamentally".
The politician announced: "In the Occupational Safety and Health Act, which we want to pass in the Cabinet at the end of July, there are also measures that not only affect the meat industry - for example, higher inspection rates in occupational safety or clear criteria for community accommodation."
The draft presented to the DPA includes amendments to the Law on Ensuring Workers’ Rights in the Meat Industry and to the Labour Protection Act.
Brandenburg’s Consumer Protection Minister Ursula Nonnemacher (Green) believes more intensive controls are needed.
"I would like us to be able to do even more controls in many supervisory areas: food controls, animal welfare, everything possible, for example, even animal transports," Nonnemacher said on Sunday in the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg aktuell".
However, more staffing is also needed for more controls.
Three killed in crash of ultra-light aircraft in Germany
In the crash of an ultra-light aircraft on a multi-family house in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, according to police, three people have died.
A child was easily injured.
Two other people were injured in the accident, a spokesman for the Wesel district administration said.
A parachute was found at the scene, police said.
The "Rheinische Post" reported, citing eyewitnesses, that before the crash, the plane collided with a hot air balloon.
The house is a one- or two-family house.
No further details were known at first.
Leaving the Frankfurt Opera Square peacefully
A week after the riots in Frankfurt, the evacuation of the opera house at night on Sunday also went peacefully.
Lastly, a few dozen people were still staying in the square, but left it before the start of the lockdown at 1 a.m.
The police had been in operation since early in the evening with numerous officers, and a larger police station was visible throughout the city.
For the first time this weekend, from midnight onwards, there was a ban on admission to the opera house, where riots broke out a week ago.
Policemen had been attacked with bottles from the crowd of the celebrants.
At least five officers were injured, police said, and several police vehicles were damaged.
The night on Saturday was also quiet.
Car overtakes itself: Young woman seriously injured in accident on Bundesstraße 83 near Hofgeismar
In an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old girl suffered serious injuries on Sunday at around 13:25.
She was taken to Kassel Hospital.
With thermal imaging cameras, the fire brigade was looking for possible occupants.
According to police, the woman was on the road 83 in the direction of her place of residence Hümme, when her car came off the road from an unexplained cause and overturned several times.
In order to save the victims, the fire brigade had to freshen the roof of the car.
Since it was not clear if anyone was still in the vehicle, the adjoining cornfield was searched by the rotary ladder using a thermal imaging camera.
The drone crew from Warburg, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, had also been ordered for the search of persons.
However, the forces did not find anyone among the tall corn plants.
The seriously injured woman was taken to the Kasseler Klinikum for further treatment by ambulance.
Nearly 50 firefighters from Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg were on site.
The highway was closed for two hours due to the accident.
Juventus Turin Champions in Italy
Turin - After a liberating goal by Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in a series.
The team around the five-time world footballer made the 36th Scudetto of the club's history perfect with a 2:0 (1:0) on Sunday night in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo hit 1-0 before halftime.
With 83 points, Turin, without the most recently injured ex-national player Sami Khedira, started two days before the end of the Serie A season, not to push away from number one.
Inter Milan's second-place finish is seven points behind.
Juventus was harmless in the first half despite optical superiority, then Ronaldo met after a free-kick variant with the last action.
An example of Miralem Pjanic used the 35-year-old from the penalty area limit directly with a flat shot (45.+7).
Against the now more offensive guests, Ronaldo was also involved in the 2-0, after his shot Federico Bernardeschi (67.) dusted off.
This ensured the glareless but decisive success.
The foul meter shot to the lattice in the 89th minute, only Ronaldo himself is likely to have correctly aggravated with regard to the goalkeeper rating.
“It’s complicated to stay mentally and physically at ball level for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and the momentum changes very easily," said coach Maurizio Sarri after the 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Above all, the mental exhaustion of his players is great, said the Juve coach.
Due to the defeat, the Turiners had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
Last but not least, Juve’s calming lead at the top of the table was due to the weakness of its competitors.
In the eleven games before the game on Sunday, the Sarri team managed only five victories.
Whether Ronaldo will still be the king of goalkeepers is questionable.
For while the Portuguese superstar has so far scored 31 goals, former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile has already 34 hits on his account after his triple-pack at 5:1 (1:1) of the fourth-placed Lazio Roma at Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title win of FC Bayern.
The record in Italy is held by current Juve professional Gonzalo Higua<0xC3><0xAD>n.
The Argentinian scored 36 goals for the SSC Naples in the 2015/2016 season.
In August, the "Old Lady" of Italian football awaits the next title chance.
Juventus are in the eighth final of the Champions League, however, on August 7 against Olympique Lyon must compete a 0:1 draw to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next K.o. round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would be waiting as opponents.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - Despite all threatened penalties and court rulings, motorists continue to gas in countless illegal races on the Baden-Württemberg roads: In the past year and the first four months of this year, police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
Comparative values for the previous years do not exist, but the racists are increasingly working for the judicial authorities: in 2018, a total of 155 investigations were conducted between Konstanz and Mannheim for illegal races, a year later there were already 252 and in the current year until the beginning of June there were already 151.
The races were less about organized events, as the response of the Ministry of the Interior to a request from the Landtag SPD shows.
In most cases, the drivers had spontaneously raced against each other or they had taken the flight from the police - also this is indicated as an illegal race.
German men between the ages of 18 and 60 were at the wheel.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases are the razors caught and also asked to the cash register: according to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed since 2018 and 15 sentences of imprisonment have been imposed.
However, there is no indication that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, other drivers reacted more sensitively to the numerous tragic accidents and trials of previous years than before and indicated more frequently, a ministry spokesman said.
Especially popular with Rasern is the 8th motorway, where motorists are constantly slowing down traffic to make room for themselves and use the free distance for a race.
Last August, a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim unter Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 drivers on the A8 near Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular "race track"
On the A81, the police register even more races than on any other federal highway.
With a tempo limit, attempts are made to brake the razors on the particularly affected section between narrows and geisingen.
The mostly high-priced and upscale sports and luxury cars often have Swiss license plates, because drivers avoid driving too fast and racing in the neighboring country for lawns to Germany due to the high penalties.
For the SPD, the speed limit must not be reduced to a few routes: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour, we would be able to solve this problem on motorways from the body," says Martin Rivoir, the traffic expert of the SPD-Landtagsfraktion.
"The limit for racers would be significantly higher if you weren't legally here and there with 200 kilometers per hour and more on the road."
From enlightenment or image campaigns, Rivoir thinks less: "He who in this way disregards all the rules and puts not only his own life but also the lives of other road users at risk, is hardly reachable with reason".
ADAC calls for stronger police intervention
On the other hand, this is not enough for ADAC: "We assume that Raser cannot be deterred by the speed limits," says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at ADAC Württemberg.
It requires additional and also harder checks on the affected tracks.
From January 2019 to April 2020, three people died nationwide in the races, two of them uninvolved in a nighttime crash in downtown Stuttgart and one in Gerlingen.
Two young men are said to have won a car race there in November.
One of the vehicles came off the road, crashed against a garden wall and stayed on the side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
21 other people were injured in the races over the past two years.
In the opinion of Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, however, sharper penalties are not necessary: "Legislative action is not needed to sanction illegal motor vehicle races more severely," it says in the paper of the Ministry of the Interior.
Blue light from July 23: Thirsty burglar steals drinks from snacks
Rohrdorf: A man broke into a snack on Thursday in Rohrdorf (Calw district) and stole drinks and cash.
A witness heard noises in the valley road around 3.40 a.m. and ran towards the imbisses.
There he noticed a man serving drinks at the refrigerator and then leaving the snack through a previously knocked-in front door.
The perpetrator fled towards the meadows behind the snack.
According to police, the burglar also used a cash register and stole cash in the low three-digit area.
The suspect is described as follows: He is about 1.75 to 1.80 meters tall and of strong stature.
In fact, he wore a black hoodie, black pants and light shoes.
The police are accepting further evidence from witnesses.
Ackermann sprints to victory on final stage at Sibiu Tour
Cycling professional Pascal Ackermann won his second day’s victory at the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old from Team Bora-hansgrohe passed the 109-kilometer stretch with start and finish in Hermannstadt in the mass sprint, after winning a stage already on Saturday.
It was the season three and four wins for Ackermann.
In the overall standings, his Austrian teammate Gregor Mühlberger prevailed.
The 26-year-old had sovereignly decided the mountain time riding for himself and thus took the lead in the ranking.
Only 104 riders had entered the final stage in the evening.
No less than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit in mountain time driving.
"I'm really happy to start the season restart with a win," Ackermann said after his success on Saturday.
“The sprint was really hectic,” the 26-year-old said.
300 meters ahead of the finish line, he simply put on his sprint, "and it worked perfectly".
According to the rules of the World Association UCI, a corona test was performed on all race participants and their companions six days before the start of the race.
During the entire tour, drivers and caregivers were separated from the organizing team and the media in isolated hygiene bubbles.
Attendants at the start and finish were not allowed.
The head office gave instructions for the lay resuscitation
Düsseldorf - Tragic accident on Sunday afternoon in Düsseldorf-Garath.
In a multi-family house, a child (4) was suddenly livingless in the water while bathing.
According to the fire department, the emergency call came in just before 1 p.m.
"A senior officer immediately gave instructions for the layman's resuscitation," a firefighter told BILD.
The incoming rescue forces took over the resuscitation measures a little later.
The life-threatening child was transported to the clinic under resuscitation.
Why it crashed is unclear.
The police routinely started investigations into the accident.
The firefighter said: "We are starting from a tragic accident in the apartment".
Nuremberg: Unauthorized tuning meeting - police intervene, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and at the same time more than 1,000 people participated Saturday night in a "tuning meeting" in the parking lot of a furniture house.
The police implemented their announcement to intensify control of such events.
A big tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (25 July 2020) in the southern city of Nuremberg.
Hundreds of vehicles were involved.
According to police Mittelfranken, an increase in vehicle traffic in the area of a large parking lot in Ingolstadter Straße was detected by the Nuremberg traffic police around 10:30 p.m.
The police then carried out a number of vehicle checks.
Only recently, the police had announced that they would step up their efforts against so-called autoposers.
Illegal tuning meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "scene"
The officials at the top numbered about 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, the police said.
Of this, however, only a small part of the attendees of the "autoposer" and tuning scenes should be assigned.
Apparently, most of the scene in question complied with the police’s appeal.
On the basis of the vehicles and persons present on site, it should be assumed that these were mainly showmen.
In addition, the majority of those present adhered to the current infection protection regulations, in particular the observance of the minimum distance and the wearing of a mouth-nose protection.
The on-the-spot checks were completed at around 1:00 a.m.
In total, the officials in 10 vehicles observed such structural changes that the operating permit was extinguished.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No car races
There were no illegal car races.
"The Police Bureau Mittelfranken will continue to monitor the events and will continue to implement enhanced control measures, including in connection with the emergence of spectators," it said.
The news agency News5 spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger about the involved towing company: "They all have beautiful rims, which we must not scratch," says Schrödinger.
Special tapes would be used for this.
Also, because the cars are wider, the company has to be careful not to do any damage.
"Young people should finally get their cars back undamaged."
Labour Agency figures: 900 suspected cases of abuse in short-term employment
Berlin - The Federal Agency for Labour (BA) is investigating around 900 suspected cases of misuse of short-term workers' money.
"This is extremely little for more than 880,000 companies that have shown short work," said Daniel Terzenbach, the executive board responsible for the operational business, to the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung".
When, at the beginning of the Corona crisis, very many companies suddenly applied for short work, the BA would have had to react quickly.
The exam usually takes up to three weeks.
“We didn’t have that much time in this hot season.
The more closely we will look at the final accounts.
I'm sure a lot will follow.
We are not naive and have a long breath.”
Indications of abuse often came from the affected employees or trade unions.
In addition, the BA analysis software is used to detect abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible insolvency wave in the autumn.
"Will there be significantly more insolvencies than in the previous year?
The assessments differ, but we are preparing ourselves for the case and are already training our employees in the work agencies for the processing of applications for insolvency money".
The numbers are still inconspicuous, Terzenbach said.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party in the New Garden dissolved
Potsdam - On Friday evening about 40 young people celebrated a party in the Neue Garten.
The gathering was dissolved at 8:48 p.m. by the drivers of the Prussian Castles and Gardens Foundation (SPSG), the foundation announced on PNN request.
The children would have left the park.
On Saturday evening, some youths would have played rugby in the New Garden.
The meadow was cleared by revier riders, SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee said on Sunday.
Illegal celebrations in the parks
In the parks of the Foundation, gatherings occur again and again, in which the distance and hygiene rules of the Covid-19 Procedure Regulation are not observed.
At the end of June, there was a celebration with about 300 people in the Park Babelsberg, a week later about 150 people celebrated in the New Garden.
Even without a corona regulation, the parks will be closed in the event of dark.
The storage on the meadows is prohibited according to the parking regulations, there are only a few exceptions.
The foundation has been complaining for a long time that visitors are leaving more and more garbage and destroying protected biotopes.
In Berlin, illegal park parties have reached a different dimension.
In the Hasenheide district of Neukölln, 5,000 people celebrated an illegal techno party on Sunday night.
The event was dissolved by the police.
Austria: Mass tests after coronavirus outbreak in tourist resort
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist resort of St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases rose to 48, as reported by the state authorities in Linz.
There were more than 100 results in the evening.
Accordingly, many of the infected are young interns in tourism companies, but at least one holiday guest has also been tested positive.
Residents, guests and tourism staff were asked to stay in their accommodations on Saturday night.
The lockdown was set at 11 p.m.
"There are cancellations and cancellations there and there" of bookings, the head of the tourism association Wolfgangsee, Hans Wieser, told the dpa.
Also, some of the guests have left early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist resort in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, about a third of the guests are Germans.
By Friday, the first infections had become public.
The head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, on Saturday defended the behavior of the interns who had celebrated at several venues and could have become infected there.
"We all liked to do that in our youth," he told radio station <0xC3><0x96>1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The Tourism Association launched an information campaign to raise awareness among young employees of the dangers of Covid-19.
As of Saturday, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from July 15 were contacted.
The outbreak evokes memories of the Austrian ski and party resort of Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a centre of corona spread throughout Europe during the initial phase of the pandemic.
In total, more than 1,500 people in Austria are currently infected with the virus.
The focus of the new infections is on Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualify for Champions League
London (dpa) - English football record champion Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year of absence.
On the last day of the Premier League, the Red Devils secured third place in the standings by a 2:0 (0:0) victory against direct rival Leicester City.
The Foxes now have to settle for the Europa League, because FC Chelsea still passed and qualified as fourth for the king class as well.
In the fight against the descent, Aston Villa was allowed to cheer.
Manchester United led by a penalty kick from Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in the playoffs, Jesse Lingard (90th+8) made it to the final.
Chelsea, in the Champions League eighth-final opponent of FC Bayern, won thanks to Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4) in parallel with 2:0 (2:0) against the Wolverhampton Wanderers.
"That means a lot to me," said coach Frank Lampard, who also stands in the FA Cup final against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea coach.
Chelsea's victory against Wolverhampton also benefited Tottenham Hotspur, who passed the Wolves with a slim 1:1 (1:0) at Crystal Palace and started as a sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa decided the long-distance duel with FC Watford and AFC Bournemouth on his own, but had to shake at West Ham United for a long time to keep the class.
The late lead of Jack Grealish (84th) immediately equalled Andrei Jarmolenko (85th).
The 1:1 (0:0) was enough, however, because Watford lost 2:3 (1:3) to Arsenal.
The club, which scored three coaches in the season, is declining after five years in the Premier League.
Just like Bournemouth, who could not save himself by a 3:1 (2:1) at FC Everton.
In the end, one point was missing.
FC Liverpool, which has been standing as an English champion since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3-1 (1:1) win at Newcastle United.
99 counters are the highest value the Reds have ever achieved in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team barely missed the score record in English football.
The best mark is held by Manchester City with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After the Newcastle lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) shot the game on Sunday for Liverpool.
"For this wonderful club, it was an extraordinary season," said goalkeeper van Dijk after the game, "that should encourage us to defend the title.
It's going to be hard."
In the end, the Premier League bosses will also be satisfied.
Due to the coronavirus crisis, football operations in England were interrupted from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, there was even a discussion about an early termination or a postponement of the remaining games on neutral ground.
After all, the season could be played without special events - but as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence in protests against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Prime Minister Netanyahu are becoming more and more violent.
During the night there were violent clashes.
Israeli police took violent action against participants in a demonstration against the right-wing conservative head of government Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Sunday night.
Twelve people have been arrested for participating in riots, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.
Among other things, the police used water jets to disperse the demonstration.
According to media reports, on Saturday night, around 6,000 people gathered near Netanyahu’s office.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu’s handling of the Corona crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew horns and called on Netanyahu to resign.
Participants of a counter-demonstration who supported Netanyahu were also arrested, the news site "ynet" reported.
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the head of government’s private villa in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man was arrested near Tel Aviv on suspicion of spraying pepper spray on protesters from a driving car on the side of the road.
Another man was arrested after a knife attack on a protester in the south of the country.
The demonstrator was easily wounded in the neck.
There have been several demonstrations against Netanyahu in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
The demonstrations accompany the corruption process against the head of government.
Recently, Netanyahu was also criticized for his handling of the Corona crisis.
Among other things, he is being held up for premature easing and a lack of preparation for a second corona wave.
The Corona crisis has hardened the country’s economy.
The unemployment rate last year was more than 20 percent.
The number of new infections with the coronavirus in Israel has recently risen to ever new records.
Accident near Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter force on car - nine injured - Ruhrgebiet - Bild.de
Ahlen - A car accident on Saturday afternoon caused nine minor injuries on the B58 near Ahlen.
A driver was travelling with her two children (3, 5) towards Beckum.
The police said: “Suddenly she had braked because she wanted to turn around.”
That must have been seen by the driver of a Mercedes transporter driving behind her.
He pushed back on the car.
In the accident, three passengers in the car and six in the van were slightly injured.
Several ambulances took them to a nearby hospital.
North Korea Blocks Border Town After Corona Suspected Case
So far, North Korea has seen its own measures to fight off the coronavirus as a "bright success".
Now, for the first time, the country is reporting a suspected case.
Because of a first official coronavirus case in the country, North Korea has completely locked down a major city for fear of disaster.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defense measures in the past six months, “the malicious virus could have been infiltrated into the country,” state media reported.
For the region around the border town of Kaesong, the state of emergency was imposed.
The Communist leadership called for the highest level of alarm.
Should the suspected case be confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the isolated country.
North Korea said it had not yet registered a single infection and described its defenses as a "brilliant success".
The information was questioned abroad.
The symptoms of the disease were reported to have been detected by a "snatcher" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person left for South Korea three years ago and has now returned across the border.
For the border crossing within the four kilometers wide and mostly still mined military buffer zone, there was initially no confirmation from South Korea.
South Korea’s military, however, acknowledged the possibility of an illegal border crossing to North Korea, according to reports from the national news agency Yonhap.
This led to investigations of some people.
North Korea on Saturday called an emergency meeting of the Labour Party’s political office chaired by power-holder Kim Jong Un over the suspected case.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive disaster".
Kim ordered on Friday as a preventive measure to "completely block Kaesong and isolate each district and the region from others," it said.
The person concerned, as well as all people in Kaesong who had been in contact with him, were placed under quarantine.
Accordingly, the party’s central military commission is to investigate the “extortion case” as well as the conduct of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose harsh penalties.
It is estimated that about 300,000 people live in Kaesong.
Tension ahead of Council meeting: City-East and noise protection still ahead of big summer break to be discussed
"In addition to environmental issues, the members of the committees will also vote on the building plan for the large-scale urban development east project," the central part of the city press release for the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, July 28, at 4.30 pm in the Great Hall of the CongressCentre Pforzheim says.
Above all, however, the upgrade of the eastern city is controversial until the end.
The majority is short of it, most recently even rejecting it in individual committees depending on the presence.
An appeal from the economy (building, real estate, commerce and IT), the project developed out of the citizenry and then by the administration and the municipal council, now not to fail after almost ten years of preparation, criticized project opponents Reinhard Klein as "out-parliamentary opposition", "reckless", "speculation", "falsification" and "falsification".
"Everyone thinks to know it better," says Klein, who has been the only representative of the Pforzheim City Council for a year.
In fact, after reading the treaties, he is in this position: "I know what I'm talking about".
The exit makes the city cheaper, the Technical City Hall is contrary to statements of the city administration after subsidies, whose existence Klein is convinced to renovate for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop in a completely different way than what is predicted in the City Hall and by the proponents of the economy.
This is his plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED group, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It also essentially envisages the renovation of the Technical City Hall, the open keeping of the Schlossberg, the rental of the ex-Thales for administrative areas and a smaller downtown redevelopment ideally with local carriers.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues in particular will play a central role.
Among other things, the municipal council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the Pforzheimer population from health-related noise pollution caused by road traffic, including many temporal reductions.
In a press release, the local transport club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this must come about because they have to do so by neglecting the line bus traffic with diluted rhythms and by so little commitment to the traffic of the car.
The municipal council also votes on the participation of the city of the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
Also on the agenda is the accession to the climate protection pact of the state of Baden-Württemberg, the re-establishment of parental contributions in urban child care facilities and the application for inclusion in the Smart City funding of the Federal Government.
Citizens are welcome, but must take precautions against the coronavirus.
Tim Zimmermann launches into the new season with a lot of delay
Tim Zimmermann starts his season at the ADAC GT Masters on July 31 with a delay of almost half a year.
Before the Supercar League could start regular operations, the first test drives were now available.
For Zimmermann, it was mainly about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3.
The Corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from embarking on his first service ride in Grasser Racing’s new Lamborghini Huracan.
This was now possible under special hygiene conditions.
The 23-year-old Langenargen turned his first laps on the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his premiere in the GT3 car.
“There are already a few things that are different from the Porsche from the pre-season,” says Zimmermann.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to go in the curves differently.
But it's really been a lot of fun."
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
The Dutchman, despite his experience in GT sport for only 25 years, was able to help his new teammate in many things.
“I’m not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series also brings new challenges,” says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I understand each other blindly and we have also made tremendous progress at the Lausitzring from session to session".
Just there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also hold its first race.
As of July 31, the 33 supersport cars will race through the Lausitz.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 serienneulings, knows the route.
In 2015 he was the last guest at the Motodrome.
“It worked quickly and I didn’t have to get used to the track,” says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafener Renngemeinschaft Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has a lot of fast passages that you have to take optimally to be fast".
How fast Zimmermann really is then, it turns out in two weeks.
"Of course, the teams do a little poker in the tests," he says.
"In the end, however, we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring".
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a tightly packed calendar.
There will be seven races until the beginning of November.
Current status is that no spectators will be allowed – but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at the Nürburgring, former Formula 1 driver Niko Hülkenberg will enter the GT steering wheel.
British transport minister caught cold by quarantine decision
The British government's decision to quarantine Spain's holidaymakers after their return for two weeks has caught the country's transport minister cold, according to press reports.
According to him, Grant Shapps is currently on vacation in Spain, while his colleagues decided on the measure at home on Saturday.
Due to the rising number of coronavirus cases in Spain, the Cabinet in London has removed the country from the list of countries from which it is possible to enter without quarantine conditions.
The new regulation will apply from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to quarantine after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures on returnees.
But the scheme applies to those who are just on holiday, only from Saturday, August 1, and was not introduced overnight.
By the way, Spain is still considered one of the "safe countries" in Austria, for which no quarantine is needed in Austria.
"Many ministers may have been aware in advance that there is a possibility that a quarantine will be imposed on holidaymakers in Spain," said Labour MP Diane Abbot.
"But apparently no one has bothered to tell Grant Shapps".
Almost a month after the end of the Corona emergency in Spain and the expiry of the strict exit barrier, the number of infections in the country is rising again.
Virologists are mainly responsible for the nightlife for the new spread.
Spain is one of the favorite holiday countries of the British people.
The British government is currently advising against unnecessary travel to the Spanish mainland, which is particularly popular with British holidaymakers in the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands.
So far, more than 272,000 infections with the novel coronavirus and more than 28,000 deaths have been recorded in Spain.
Russia: Day of the Navy: Putin announces hypersonic weapons for warships
Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced on the Day of the Navy in his country an equipment of warships with the most modern hypersonic weapons.
With these world-class weapons, the combat capabilities of Russian naval forces would be expanded, Putin said Sunday in St. Petersburg at the central naval parade.
The Ministry of Defense also informed the agency Interfax about successful tests of the hypersonic missile Zircon built for the Navy.
The hypersonic weapons have a multiple of the speed of sound of about 343 meters per second.
They are considered the weapons of the future.
Underwater Tropico Continues to Be Built
It will also be built on the nuclear-powered Poseidon underwater torpedo, it said.
The planned sea drone is planned to destroy coastal targets.
The president, who also rode a military boat, said that this year alone, 40 new ships would be put into service at the individual fleet associations of the largest country in the world.
Russia has such a large coastal area as no other country in the world.
For 300 years, the Navy has been reliably protecting Russia, Putin said at the day celebrated by sailors nationwide.
Also at many other Russian coastal sites, the naval forces began the day of the Navy with parades.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting alongside the powerful Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated strength at an arms show in the Mediterranean port of Tartus.
Ammunition was also fired.
In a video released by the Ministry of Defense, not only warships, including a submarine, were seen, but also combat helicopters and jets.
Hurricane "Hanna" reaches Texas: help difficult due to corona
Washington - The first hurricane of this season over the Atlantic has landed in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds and heavy rains now threatened parts of the U.S. state, the National Hurricane Center of the U.S. Climate Agency (NOAA) said on Sunday night.
Governor Greg Abbott called for a state of emergency for many districts.
The coronavirus pandemic in Texas is making it harder for helpers to work, Abbott said, according to U.S. media.
Evacuees are called for caution
"Every hurricane is a huge challenge," Abbott said, according to the Houston Chronicle.
Looking at the Texas whirlwind, he added, "This challenge is complicated and will be even more aggravated when you consider that it is sweeping through an area that is the most heavily affected by COVID-19 in the state."
According to Johns Hopkins University, about 5,000 people have died in Texas alone as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
Abbott called on people who had to leave their homes to be careful.
They should not disregard practices “to which we have become accustomed,” such as wearing masks, the governor said, according to CBS.
It is important that everyone stay away.
Therefore, hotel rooms have also been provided in some places.
In addition, emergency accommodations are to be tested on Corona.
Damage was initially reported only from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Storm Warning Retracted
At wind speeds of up to 150 kilometers per hour, "Hanna" had landed on Padre Island just off the Texas coast, according to authorities.
The storm had previously been classified as the lowest-level hurricane.
For the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a flood warning had been issued and was later withdrawn.
Authorities expected a weakening as "Hanna" moved further inland and headed for northeastern Mexico.
"Douglas" moves to Hawaii
In the Pacific, Hurricane "Douglas" was traveling toward Hawaii at wind speeds of around 150 kilometers per hour on Sunday night.
The Hurricane Center, however, expected it to weaken further.
According to the forecast, it is expected to be near the largest islands of Hawaii on Sunday (local time) - then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
Over the Atlantic, NOAA expected an above-average hurricane season this year, according to a May forecast.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes are expected, of which up to six could be very strong hurricanes, the authority had said.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year over the Atlantic, three of which develop into storms of great strength.
Given the available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season is only 30 percent, compared to an average of only ten percent, it said at the time.
U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that his government is closely monitoring the storms and is in contact with the affected states.
Four goals undetermined: Video assistant "punished" Sassuolo
Sassuolos Filip Djuricic missed two goals
Naples - Four goals scored, four goals missed: Sassuolo Calcio experienced a raven-black night at 0:2 (0:1) at the SSC Naples in the Italian Serie A football league - and was really angry at the video assistant of the referee.
"A festival of not given goals for Sassuolo.
The VAR has never done so hard against a team," commented the Corriere dello Sport.
Host Naples was led by a goal by foreign defender Elseid Hisaj in the 8th minute, in the 32nd minute Filip Djuricic first cheered the balance.
The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) withdrew the hit due to a away position.
Five minutes later, Djuricic shot the ball back into the net - the VAR intervened again.
The goals of strikers Francesco Caputo (50th) and Domenico Berardi (61st) also withdrew the referee team, according to the VAR.
In the playoffs, Allan made the 2-0 final for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo perfect.
"The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a radar trap on the road and punishes Sassuolo like no other team.
The new technology sets records," writes the "Gazzetta dello Sport".
FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start to the hot preparation phase for the Champions League began for double-winner FC Bayern with a setback.
After a short break and a few days of training, Hansi Flick, who recovered "somewhat well" after the first team training, has to think about how he can rebuild his successful defense after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who behind captain Manuel Neuer and midfield manager Joshua Kimmich has the third most minutes to play, suffered a band injury to the left foot root and is at risk of missing in crucial king-class duels.
In Munich's Schmuddelwetter, the right-wing defender broke off a training game and was driven off the pitch with a golf card.
How long the unrestricted regular player has to pause in the fight for the title is open.
A bet in the eighth-final back game against FC Chelsea on August 8 is unlikely to be possible, and the 24-year-old can hope for the final tournament starting in Lisbon on August 12.
The Bavarians do not want to be stopped by the misfortune of training on Sunday.
In his personal triple formula, Flick named the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on the way to Portugal’s capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration are expected to show its victorious title-gatherers in the ideally next 28 days until the King-class final game on August 23.
“We have done a great job with the championship and the cup.
Now we have to create the special thing," Flick said.
Until the Munichers can deal with the final tournament and previously a training camp in the Algarve concretely, however, for the first time the eight-final obligation is against FC Chelsea.
After the 3:0 in the run-up to the Corona break, the Londoners in the home arena should not become the Bavarian nightmare again, as in the lost "Final Dahoam" in 2012.
“We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and build trust with a good game,” Flick said.
The match will be played on Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a lengthy address, Flick had sworn in to a one-time August for his stars who had taken a 13-day vacation after the double.
31 players he welcomed to the Säbener Straße, including the new actors for the noble purchase Leroy Sané, who for the first time after his move from Manchester City met all the new colleagues on the square.
"Leroy fits in well like all the new ones," Flick reported.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sané & Co. are no longer allowed to just train, Flick talked much more about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of individual and small group training, he is now training in team strength for the Londoners, who, unlike the Flick ensemble, are in the rhythm of the game.
After that, the Munichns could face a quarter-final against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, in the semi-finals are Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin possible opponents.
A way to the final in Lisbon "is not quite that easy", stressed the head coach, who can rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday.
Klose and Flick know of so many common tournament preparations, which is especially important in the 0-to-100 match.
With his current team, working is "a pleasure," Flick praised.
The "focus on winning" was an impressive move of his team.
At the tournament with Neuner teams on Sunday, it also went ambitiously to the point.
Of the performers, all were present, including the willing migrant Thiago and defender David Alaba, whose stay beyond the royal season is not guaranteed.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to choose its world champion
Since it is not possible to drive on the required number of continents, the FIA must improvise to award the World Cup titles.
All American races have been cancelled.
The race calendar is becoming more and more concrete.
The racing calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
Three more racetracks were added to the ten confirmed Grand Prixs so far this week.
The Nürburgring in Germany and Portim<0xC3><0xA3>o in Portugal will be held in October.
On November 1st, Lewis Hamilton and Co. compete for World Championship points on the Italian traditional track in Imola.
According to the current state, the 2020 race calendar includes 13 races.
“We are delighted to continue to make great progress in completing our plans for the 2020 season,” said Chase Carey, Formula One’s CEO.
A total of 15 to 18 races will be held in this extraordinary season in the royal class of motorsport.
Formula 1 will finish its season in Asia.
The final race calendar is to be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
According to media reports, before the already officially targeted races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December, performances in Vietnam and Malaysia could still take place at the end of November.
Regulations require races on three continents
However, the Formula One regulations require races on at least three continents for the award of the World Championship.
Even if, as currently planned, only on two continents will be driven, there is supposed to be a world champion.
Using a special rule, the FIA wants to award the titles on the basis of "exceptional circumstances" due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional start to the season in Australia in March had to be cancelled in the short term due to the on-going coronavirus crisis.
A return to the continent this year is not an issue.
Formula 1 will not be a guest in America this year.
Refusal to Criticize Brazil
Due to the tense corona situation, the races will not take place in Canada, the USA, Mexico and Brazil.
“We look forward to being with them again next season,” Carey said.
The cancellation of the Americas races met with criticism, especially in Brazil: "The cancellation did not come as a surprise to us, but we cannot accept the reasons for it," said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo.
Thus, the infection rates in the S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo area are significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
Also, the concerns of some teams that they do not want to drive in Brazil would not justify rejection.
Be prepared for the required security measures.
Greta Thunberg: Ugly look at Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest on Stephen Colbert’s famous late night show via video chat and told in the interview what she had in mind when she met Donald Trump.
Climate activist Greta Thunberg was a guest on a popular U.S. late-night show via video chat.
Among other things, she spoke about her struggle against the world’s powerful.
The teenage girl also spoke about her famous “bad look” when she met Donald Trump.
New York City - Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has drawn attention with her tireless commitment to the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now, in a well-known late-night show, she spoke about her plans for the future as well as her meeting with US President Donald Trump at last year’s UN climate summit.
Latenight moderator Stephen Colbert greeted 17-year-old Thunberg on Tuesday on your show and conducted a longer interview with the Swede.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the world’s powerful.
“There are some things that surprised me,” she said.
"How far people go to divert the focus away from the climate crisis," she said.
“Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats, just because a group of children goes to the streets,” she said.
Heads of state and leading politicians who ridicule her on social media or even try to silence her, she finds it "funny" because she shows the reactions "because they have no other answer to it".
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was addressed to a well-known scene in which she took a bitter look at US President Trump.
At the 2019 UN Climate Summit in New York, for which the Aktvistin sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive gaze was captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip created a GIF, i.e. an animated image that eventually became one of the most commonly used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the U.S. president at the time?
To the relatively open question of Stephen Colbert, she replied only briefly and dryly: "To be honest, I don't think there's any need for any further explanation."
The experienced satirist Colbert had probably not expected the ready answer and briefly disappeared laughing from the picture.
With her "How dare you?" speech on the principles of climate protection, she remained in the memory of many at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmunder Real Estate with triple pack for Lazio Rome
Ciro Immobile is now equal in the race for Europe’s Golden Shoe with Bayern’s Robert Lewandowski.
Former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile still has the best chance of becoming goalkeeper king in the Italian football championship.
The former BVB professional managed three hits in the 5:1 (1:1) victory of Lazio Rome against Hellas Verona, including two converted eleven meters in the replay times of both halves.
With this, the 30-year-old from the fourth round of the table now has two season games before the end of 34 season goals on his account - the same number Robert Lewandowski of FC Bayern Munich scored in the last Bundesliga season.
In Italy Cristiano Ronaldo follows with 30 goals so far, the Portuguese superstar met with the top rider in the evening still on Sampdoria Genoa.
Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green has died.
His life was like a roller coaster ride: After a rapid ascent with Fleetwood Mac, it went steeply downhill and then slowly back up.
Blues rock guitarist Peter Green has died at the age of 73.
Genius guitarist, drug junkie, cult follower: Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green has died.
He died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 73, family members announced Saturday in an official statement that another statement would be announced for the next few days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton praised Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional response of a "monumental loss" for all former and current members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
The drummer Fleetwood and the guitarist Green had founded the now legendary band in London in 1967, to this day his dreamy instrumental hit "Albatross" is unforgettable.
The life of the musician ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") was like a roller coaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated their greatest successes without him.
Among other things, there was a dispute, because Green wanted to donate all the profits of the group for charitable purposes.
He began to appear in wide robes and with great crucifixion.
Psychic problems have also played a role.
Three years after its founding, Green left the band in 1970.
This was followed by a social decline.
The blues-rock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographers reported.
For a long time, Green was treated in psychiatry.
During most of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the scene.
He is said to have lived on the street for a time, worked as a cemetery gardener, and spent time in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946, the son of a Jewish working-class family in Bethnal Green, London.
From an early age, he was passionate about American blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven, he learned the first guitar grips.
At the age of 15, the teenager began playing guitar professionally and five years later got the chance to be a lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
Shortly thereafter, he was hired by the Bluesbreakers as a replacement for his idol Eric Clapton.
In the middle of the blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 with his Bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross", composed by Green, provided the group with the first number-one hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted them to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its shadow sides: Green did not cope with the media turmoil, his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
He later commented on the life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that has happened to me in life is the drugs - the best thing was to land a number one hit".
Towards the end of the decade, Green achieved a surprising success in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Fleetwood Mac, meanwhile, swam without him in a new formation on a wave of success.
Her 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
