Parliament did not support the amendment liberating Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian parliament today rejected a proposal to repeal a paragraph under the amendment to the Criminal Code on the basis of which opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko was convicted.
An amendment that would pave the way for the release of the jailed ex-premier, MEPs rejected at the second reading of the proposal to reduce penalties for economic offences.
Tymoshenko was sentenced in October to seven years in prison for allegedly concluding an unfavourable contract with Russia to buy natural gas.
The judgment is not valid, the appeal of the sentenced person is to be heard by the court in December.
Tymoshenko describes the verdict as a political vengeance of the regime, a suspicion from the preoccupation of the court has provoked a trial in the West.
The proposal to remove section 365 of the Criminal Code, on the basis of which the former prime minister was sentenced, was supported by 147 MPs in the vote.
It needed 226 votes to approve it.
Category: Libyan victories
The story of Libya’s liberation, or Libya’s rebellion, already has its defeats.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him is after the war.
It remains to define the winner.
As is customary in the region, the Islamists will win the elections, but it is a question of whether they are moderate or radical.
The Transitional National Council has applied for customary Sharia law and we already have an idea of it.
Libya will become a crime-free country because theft cuts the hand.
Women can forget about emancipation, possible apostates from the faith await execution and so on.
Instead of the person of a dictator, a society consisting of rival tribes will unify the Koran.
There will be an order in Libya that we cannot imagine and that we certainly would not want.
But our way of life is not the only one, nor objectively the best, and it would probably not suit the Libyans for change.
In fact, it is surprising that Islamic fighters took the help of infidel dogs.
They are only sorry that, from their point of view, it was not a NATO general from America who led the strikes, but Allah, whose greatness they celebrated with every successful intervention.
So when the winners are sought in Libya, the West is not among them.
We participated in the shootings, served Islam, and our politicians, in the person of a dictator, got rid of a political ally without guaranteeing any profit.
After recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not militarily occupying Libya.
This leaves the locals with the problem of expelling the "crusaders".
But without an occupation, will the oil company have black gold behind its back?
They may not be enough, and the West will finally be able to boast of the selfless protection of human rights.
Unless, of course, the Sharia law advocates can stop us from doing this.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are on the lookout for investors
On Tuesday, a statistical slump swept across Europe.
Individual countries have published GDP data for 3Q.
The Czech economy has stagnated quarter-on-quarter, Germany and France are growing.
Today, the bond market is breaking records.
Investors are no longer just looking at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and more.
The statistical authorities of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries have published preliminary estimates of the economic development for the third quarter.
Germany’s GDP grew by the expected 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries adjusted for the second quarter, in which Germany was also better than expected (growth of 0.3% instead of the original 0.1%), while France said it showed a slight decline of 0.1% (original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent year-on-year in the third quarter of this year.
However, gross domestic product (GDP) stagnated quarter-on-quarter, confirming the trend of gradual slowdown in economic performance.
The results are worse than analysts’ estimates.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent year-on-year in the third quarter of this year, but stagnated year-on-year.
According to preliminary and seasonally adjusted data, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
The economy of the euro area and the European Union grew by 0.2 percent between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which is in line with analysts' expectations.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2 per cent year-on-year.
The yield on its 10-year bonds is 28.45%.
Yields from Italian and Spanish bonds are rising to critical limits.
The problems are starting to feel in Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc...
Yields on Czech 10-year bonds remain below 4%, even though the situation in the region is deteriorating.
There are voices from Germany that the ECB should be the creditor of last resort.
The Czechs qualified for the Euro.
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and celebrate the progress for 200 million
The football team has done the hardest job of the season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the great Czech and the beautiful goalkeeper Petr Jir<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, she won 1-0.
Czech football, even with a lot of luck in the second half, defended a luxury lead from home rematches and will not be missing again at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz watched the progress match in a detailed report.
Almost no excitement in the first half and a big chunk of luck in the second.
The Czech national team, also thanks to the domestic defeat in the final, the great Czech and the hero Jir<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek won in Montenegro happily 1: 0 and celebrates the progress to the European Championship.
Due to the precise defense of the Czech whole, the Montenegrins only got under pressure in the second half.
Damjanovi<0xC4><0x87> and Vu<0xC4><0x8D>ini<0xC4><0x8D> were the match’s scorers, who burned two big chances.
Thanks to the great Petru <0xC4><0x8C>ech, the Czech national team will not miss the European Championship next year, and a prize of about 200 million crowns will be added to the box office of the national football team.
A lot of fighting football has been played since the opening minutes.
Both teams found it difficult to get involved in the combination and played mostly around the half-line.
The pressure of domestic footballers did not come even in the first half, because the Czech defense accurately repelled the long shots for the defense.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They have created a living shield.
Several hundred college students have created a live shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
With their gesture, they want to express support for their country’s nuclear program ahead of a possible Israeli attack.
The students prayed in front of the facility at noon on Tuesday and then provoked the death of the United States and Israel.
Several hundred students from universities in Iran's Isfahan on Tuesday created a live shield around the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center, where uranium is being processed.
They show that they are ready to defend their country’s nuclear program with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in a recent report that Iran had apparently not stopped pursuing nuclear weapons.
A possible attack on Iran's nuclear facilities is being discussed in Israel.
The students prayed at noon before entering the Isfahan nuclear facility and then provoked the death of America and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear program as much as possible, the Israeli press said, in addition to the Isfahan center, the target would also be a facility in Natanz, where uranium is enriched.
Obese child's diet: not breakfast and dinner onions
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have problems with being overweight, with 9 percent of schoolchildren overweight and 5 percent of children overweight.
Obese children mostly come from families with an unhealthy lifestyle, as the current survey shows.
Again, it shows how important it is for a person’s healthy development of the environment in which he grows up and the patterns with which he is surrounded.
For example, on the tables of obese children, onions appear up to half more often than in families of children with normal weight.
Fried fries had to dinner the day before the research associated with an educational event called Obesity is not a coincidence more than 19 percent obese.
In addition, it is not common for fattening families to play sports, which is true for most families of today's schoolchildren - only 15 percent of children answered that their parents will find time for active movement at least once a week.
A survey of 900 children.
The survey was conducted at the end of last year’s school year and was attended by almost 900 children from elementary schools from all over the Czech Republic.
It was already the second year of the event Obesity is not a coincidence, which supports the General Health Insurance Company and the company Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 pupils from grades 4 to 8 have participated in the project.
Proper diet and sufficient exercise in the family is one of the determining factors that causes a dramatic increase in the number of overweight or even obese children.
“Only half of the respondents, for example, reported having breakfast-sniff-sniff-sniff-sniff-sniff-sniff-sniff-sniff-sniff-sniff-sniff-sniff-sniff-sniff-sniff-sniff-sniff-sniff-sniff-sniff-s five times a day, which is one of the basic assumptions of proper nutrition.”
No breakfast and no evening sausage
Experts point out that for healthy development, relative details are also essential, including, for example, the regular time of family breakfasts.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 percent of schoolchildren have breakfast at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast alone.
And the worst part was finding out that in a dozen households, they don’t eat breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the basis of a proper daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that in families of obese children, unhealthy fries are consumed much more often.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet lemonade every day (70 percent).
Although more than 40 percent of the children surveyed regularly play sports, their parents had less than half a result - 15 percent.
Set up your own diet
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to compile their own diet according to their own taste and opinion.
"The nutritional preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 years are far from ideal in terms of healthy nutrition."
Among their favorite foods are a lot of floury, meaty and sweet dishes.
"The great popularity of sweet lemonades is particularly alarming," the study's final report said.
For lunch as the main meal, pasta triumphed just above the poultry.
But the children practically did not want legumes at all and the popularity of fish and lunch vegetable dishes is also low.
Predisposition to health
At the same time, the survey showed that children are willing to adjust their eating habits if they get the right information.
"In the control group of survey participants who completed the questionnaire after the end of the Obesity education lecture, there was a significant shift in preferences towards the principles of healthy nutrition in a number of cases," the results of the project said.
It was striking, for example, for sweet lemonades, where more children would start to give preference to plain water.
Children were also much more likely to check poultry and fish as the main food of the day and limit sweet foods and dumplings.
A stylist must also be a good psychologist, says the pros
In the introductory article about how stylists learn, I complained so much that there was a lot of it already in the introductory hours.
I had no idea what was going to happen next.
Lectures by three professionals from the field, dressing problematic characters and a seminar on how it goes on the spot.
And it's gonna get worse.
The closer to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And even though the course is held every Saturday and Sunday, it is really "trapped".
This time, the director and I discussed (there is not a single boy in the course) how to dress a woman who does not have a perfectly harmonious figure.
And such is the vast majority.
Someone's got a short neck, someone's got a boy figure with no proper curves, and someone's got overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically soften the broad shoulders, lengthen the neck or add the necessary curves.
We also received tips, as for women like Jennifer Lopez, that is, bigger breasts and hips and a narrow waist, to emphasize the figure nicely and at the same time not to dress the woman too challenging.
For example, if the difference between the waist and the hips is such that the skirts or pants do not really fit, then it is worth having at least one such piece sewn to measure.
You will definitely not regret it, because perfectly fitting clothes are not to be paid for.
In a tailor-made skirt you will feel much better than in one that constantly moves, stretches, stays in the waist and so on.
The boy character, in turn, can afford to wear clothes with trimming, applications, embroidery or embroidery.
Of course, there is a lot of such information and types of characters, so I am glad that I have a whole week to sort out all the information in my head.
And I'm still afraid that, given the task at hand, it's up to it.
Each of the cursists has been assigned a celebrity to invent two outfits: day and evening.
We must take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the person and the type of character.
I'll dress up Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
In my spirit, I am looking forward to it, for me personally definitely better than Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who has recently gained maybe a hundred pounds (please take into account the excess), or young woman Selena Gomez.
We have to cut out the clothes from magazines or search the Internet and print and then graphically process them.
Moodboard, as the whole result is called, will then also express our personal style and relationship to graphic representation.
Thinking about the graphic side of styling is also important.
The stylist not only dresses physically, but also creates, for example, so-called product pages in magazines (for specific tasks, for example, trends of handbags, coats, etc.).
This was told to us by stylist and designer Mario Kamen<0xC3><0xAD>k.
But not until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general overview
On Saturday, a lecture filled with information about the types of characters was immediately diversified by three guests from the field.
Stylist Honza Pomorn<0xC3><0xBD>, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Ren<0xC4><0x8D>.
Jacob reminded us that fashion is an illusion and that a stylist should be able to use it.
And a skilled stylist can work with one piece of clothing differently.
Variability is crucial in this case.
For example, such a trenchcoat (or if you want to originally trenchcoat) can be worn classically through jeans and a T-shirt as a coat, but you can also dress it on a bare body, a boot shoe and take pictures as a dress.
Or just fold out the sleeves or collar and immediately the whole look looks different.
"Play with it," he stressed.
But I most appreciated the following advice: "You need to know the rules perfectly for work."
"Then you can start breaking them," Jacob said.
Finally, I understand why we are crushing all the lessons, what to combine with what, why, when we sometimes see something else in fashion magazines.
Not to mention the parades.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that the stylist has to have a lot more clothing options than how many can be photographed.
So for a fashion story that will have ten pages (that is, ten outfits), I have to be ready to "set" at least fifteen.
And also that in the photo the clothing looks and works in combination with other pieces of clothing completely different than in reality.
So we have to take that into account when creating the outfit.
That the image and style makes up half the success, Honza Pomorn<0xC3><0xBD> confirmed to us.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly a miracle singer, but the image and marketing made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, access to the services of stylists is so far rather cold.
Even familiar faces sometimes consider it useless (it is enough that I can do something, the way I look at it is secondary).
And if someone lets us create a styling, then we have to count on the fact that it is very likely that it dictates us a completely different (smaller) size than it really has.
Then you have to google and find out if the boulevard has not written about the fact that the celebrity has lost weight and so on.
Honza and Mario on Sunday put it to our heart that it is not enough for the stylist to be oriented in fashion and to be able to put together an outfit.
In her work, she communicates primarily with the people she dresses, and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to guess people, not to encourage oneself, to stand by one's opinion.
"When a manager orders you to sort through her closet and fill it with nice pieces, you can't throw out the whole closet and say, for God's sake, that's terrible."
“Find at least a few things there that you praise and recommend what they can be worn for,” says Mario.
He also specifically showed us what everything must contain the so-called "platelet", or bag on the plate.
It is the one that you plug around the waist and you have all the necessary properties with you.
In addition to clear things, such as scissors, hair rollers or closing pins, there are also silicone threads (with which the stylist helps when photographing products such as handbags or hats), special clips with which we tie the back of the clothes, if it is not larger (pins, pins or other pins).
In order not only to not listen, but also to try something practically, we learned how to put shoes correctly.
Even when photographing in a studio, where the surface is flat, the sole could be damaged, especially outside.
So we glued and glued.
We must not even touch the shoes with scissors so that they do not happen to be damaged.
There is a need for real skill.
Mario pleased me when he praised my creation without reservation.
The skill mentioned here is not really my friend.
This is just a small fraction of what we heard about the second weekend of the course.
It’s becoming increasingly clear to me that doing professional styling isn’t really a walk in a pink set, no matter who wants what.
Need for Speed: The Run races across America.
<0xE2><0x86><0x90> Reviews
Originally a carefree ride, due to a series of completely unnecessary slutty mistakes, turns into a routine morning ride on the Shish.
Although the ambition was largely fulfilled, it is not valid if no one clearly wanted to do anything extra.
A new part with the subtitle The Run aroused high expectations before the release.
He promised that over the years, the Need for Speed racing series would again move a bit in a new direction and from playable shows it appeared as a game that would not have to be just a number in the action racing genre.
We were also curious as to how the inserted passages would turn out, in which the main hero would get out of the car and run on his own.
But as is the custom with the NFS series, many are a little different than we expected.
These are potentially decent arcade races, but the whole pulls down a few unnecessary bugs that have been appearing in the series for more or less several years.
So these are not actually mistakes, but rather manifestations of some incomprehensible laziness of the developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are introduced to a story whose main character Jack has certain personal problems and as a solution offers to participate in an illegal race across America.
You will sit behind the wheel on the west coast of San Francisco and your task is to be the first to arrive in New York.
The idea carries with it several interesting elements.
The track is divided into ten stages, and then into more than fifty races.
It follows that each race goes on a different track and the stages are set in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You don’t feel like the game is always the same.
In addition, some of the environments are very nice to look at, although the technical level of the graphics corresponds to the previous parts of the series.
So it's nothing world-class.
But driving across the desert, through the autumn landscape or high in the snowy mountains looks visually very pleasant.
In addition, races are occasionally laced with some atypical element.
In the desert, for example, you wind up in a sandstorm, which greatly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains, you have to be careful not to be overrun by an avalanche.
In addition, the individual races are set up quite well behind each other.
There are only a few types, but that’s enough.
For a while you try to pass the desired number of opponents (essentially a classic race), then you catch up with time (a classic duel with stops) and then you wait for a duel with a single opponent.
From time to time, the police will also be involved in this, which makes all your efforts even more unpleasant.
New are the passages outside the car.
It’s more of an interactive animation where Jack usually runs away from someone and you have to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right times.
It's not complicated.
Surprised, though, that these passages are much less in the game than you would expect (specifically, maybe even only three).
As a result, however, this is beneficial, because this element does not have a chance to become annoying and in the context of what has been said, it belongs to the elements that diversify the game.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of previous parts.
This means that it is definitely not a thing nowadays, but it can not be said that it would be a negative.
If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you will need to look elsewhere.
But the more action-packed racing here, the driving model still fits quite well, even though we could find a better one in the competition.
Until then, everything is in perfect order.
Problems begin to appear after a while.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is no longer in order.
From the game of this type, we do not expect to calculate complex deformations and collisions, but if you have no idea how your car will behave before practically any impact on any object, then probably not everything is perfectly fine.
Typically, when passing or passing cars in normal traffic, sometimes you only lick each other lightly, but at other times in an almost identical situation, your car will end up in wild pirouettes.
Or even a direct attack.
Thanks to the system of restarts, it does not matter at all, but it will disassemble you reliably.
Restarts are solved so that if you break up or go far off track, the game throws you back to the last catching point on the track.
However, there are only five reboots available in each race.
When you exhaust them, you have to start the race again from the beginning.
So it’s more of an aid in case something fails than you can rely on it.
But sometimes even restarts will not help, they will only solve the need to learn the given section of the race from memory.
The big problem with the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some corners, for example, need to be crossed in a specific way, otherwise you simply do not fit into them.
Other times you will meet "civil" cars in the same configuration at a given location, whether you arrive there first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially annoying when you see the opponent pass easily in front of you between two opposing cars, while when you get there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to bypass or brake them.
It doesn’t matter when you get to them, because it’s “calculated” so that the situation always happens right in front of your nose.
Competitors have another advantage.
Throughout the game, you will encounter several places where, again, regardless of the time, you will always be ahead of the same opponent in the same place.
Most of all, it breaks at the end of the game on a long bridge, where you go in the opposite direction.
The opponent must get there before you, obviously, at any cost.
When he drives in front of you, it makes the view of the cars against you worse, so at first you get a couple of nice smears.
You can understand the intent to make the game more exciting and adrenaline-pumping, but the execution is so obvious that it will reliably dislike you quickly.
And it's a shame, because despite the simple driving model, it's fun to play and places even so action-packed that sometimes you literally don't want to watch what's flying.
And basically it doesn’t matter if it has a concept with fifty unique tracks, sorting the races so that boredom doesn’t have a chance, or anything else.
An unusual idea is to change cars during races.
You have to be careful about the petrol pumps on the road, because it is there that you can change the car, although in the vast majority of cases you will suffice with what you just have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for urban areas, strong American turbulence on straight highways and exotic supersports for technical riding, for example on rugged mountain trails.
With the main story mode goes hand in hand and challenge mode, which are races in individual locations that you know from the story.
Here you get not only medals, but also experience points in your profile, which is common for challenges and story.
To get a higher level of the driver, various objects are unlocked: starting with cars and ending with the background for the profile.
At the same time, it is again connected to the online Autolog feature, which among other things compares your achieved results with other players and provides other community features.
One of the other hard-to-understand kicks is the situation from the last race in the story.
With your car you get to the subway tunnel (besides), where you ride it in the dark on the tracks (besides).
On the speedometer you flash numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (yet) and in that a set of metro arrives from the rear and uncompromisingly crashes you.
In the editorial office, we will probably have a discussion for a few more days about whether no one really thought a little when creating the game, or whether the authors think we are really such big fools.
The technical side of the game is nothing extra, but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases very pleasant and in a few cases even great.
It freezes so that in some more intense moments the imaging decreases, and in some cases quite tragically.
But this is especially true for turrets with a larger number of participants, when smooth imaging would no longer be valid for you.
The sound page is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to please the widest range of younger audiences, a soundtrack from the category "every dog in a different village" was created, but it can be assumed that due to listening to music, no one will buy the game.
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run is so frustrating.
If the game were to avoid completely unnecessary mistakes, then we would not be afraid to say that The Run is the best work by NFS in the last few years.
This is how the game works unfinished.
Fun is definitely fine, but be prepared that the mistakes will rip you in the eyes with the force of the airport headlights.

Ambassador to the EU Vice-President:
Czechs have a reputation for negativists and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has significantly distorted the balance between the various institutions."
"I didn't expect it to be such a hard war."
"It will take five, six years for the situation to settle down, calm down and for all players to get used to their new roles," Milena Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1>, Czech Ambassador to the European Union, began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
In the first part of her lecture, she showed how serious she was about her motto "Intelligible and open about Europe", when she managed to describe the individual EU institutions and their relations in such a clear and comprehensible way that many lecturers from the Faculty of Law in the UK could envy her.
Vice-President also praised the work of the new Permanent President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first, there was criticism that he was insignificant, that he was a gray clerk, that he couldn't play any role, and I have to say that everyone took a breather, that he played that role very well."
"He is a person who can listen to the 27 Member States, communicate with them well, and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go."
The new post of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy was then explained in response to the question: "Who is the European Union? What phone number should I call?", i.e. as an important step towards unification and greater readability of the EU's policy towards states such as China or India.
No one wants to ban the acid.
Viceenov<0xC3><0xA1> also devoted herself to the agenda that the European Council lived, lives and will live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency of the Council of Ministers called it a success.
The Czechs dealt with the impending financial crisis, solved the gas crisis or held a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The collapse of the government at this time then marked as a great negative, which has greatly damaged the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of the Ambassador, the "fact of the matter" was not only the Presidency, but also the subsequent financial crisis that is being addressed to this day.
In addition, a new seven-year Union budget has yet to be approved, which is becoming much more complicated precisely because of the current economic situation.
Whether the budget will be lean and economical, which sectors will get the upper hand, which countries will be supported more and which less, all this is on the agenda of the next negotiations.
The ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "Of Europe intelligible".
"I really don't like ugly abbreviations, strange words, slang that no one understands.
How can a citizen understand that curved or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes are not really invented in Brussels, or that we really have to be banned from acidic ones?
It also wants to make better use of the EU environment and get more Czechs into European institutions.
We have a multi-speed Europe.
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation as Eurosceptics and people who notice the negative rather than the positive side of things.
In addition, it is regretted by the low representation of Czechs in the European institutions.
According to her, there are many factors to blame, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters, but also low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Four.
"Believe me that when a Pole and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak approaches, the Frenchman next to me will say, 'Look, what are you meeting there, what is your Visegrad Four?' and he doesn't seem enthusiastic about it at all."
In the future, the Union, according to Vicens, is mainly waiting for new hard rules for the budgetary policies of the member states.
It then perceives the concept of a double-speed, if not a multi-speed Europe as very real, rather than a new "European federation."
“We have eurozone countries and countries outside the eurozone.”
"We have a Schengen area, we already have an institute for enhanced cooperation."
“For the first time, it was said that only the countries that want to work together and those that don’t want to work together should stand at a distance.”
"There will be more of these institutes, and it will be a strongly two-speed Europe," Vicenza expects.
In this regard, it also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in enforcing the principle that all issues affecting the whole Union should be discussed between all Member States, not just between euro area countries.
Brand story:
IBM Innovator Begins Second Century of Its Existence
If someone were looking for a word that would most accurately express IBM’s strategy, perhaps the closest would be “longevity.”
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution, it is a company perceived as very contemporary, and yet it has been a hundred years since it was founded.
The basis of this long-term was laid by the first head of the company, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has already coined the slogan that a number of world problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think.
His slogan "Think!" became the imprint around which the life of the future giant will unfold (and also the name of an internal magazine that began to be published at IBM as early as 1935).
It was also the basis of Watson’s carefully built corporate culture.
“For us at IBM, long-term thinking means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and prospered for a hundred years because it remained true to its core values and was not afraid to change everything else around it.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society during our first century.
We hope to achieve even more in the second hundred," said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company's current CEO.
A well-developed system
In the 1930s, Watson approached the care of his employees in the same way as the entrepreneur of Bata in the Czech Republic - people from IBM had paid holidays as one of the first American employees, insurance from the employer plus an elegant employee uniform and an elaborate business system for rewarding the best employees.
IBM also has a long-term relationship with the customer.
From the start, the company was brilliant at extracting talent - as one of the world's first companies, it abolished any discrimination, so it could choose.
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is for Palmisana to be replaced next year by a woman - Virginia Rometty.
She has worked at IBM for 30 years and is still the head of sales, marketing and strategy.
In recent years, IBM has been making so-called pitfalls, online brainstorming, from which many future strategies and innovations emerge.
No wonder there are enough ideas - almost half a million people work in the company.
Institutions with a good name
A firm position in the business is ensured by its strong internal and external image.
“In the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than just a technology company,” said Harvard Business School professor and author of the book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
“IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems through the use of technology,” said George Colony of Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, the difference between entering the market and creating the market directly.
IBM – or “Big Blue” as it is known for its logo in the United States – has grown into one of the world’s largest companies in a hundred years.
It is probably the most versatile technology company - it develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in a range of products from servers to nanotechnology.
It holds the most patents of all U.S. technology companies, and five of its employees have won the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include, for example, an ATM, a credit card, a financial swap, a barcode or a floppy disk.
IBM, with approximately $220 billion, became the second-largest technology company by market capitalization this year (the first is Apple), when it surpassed Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
A Look Ahead
Not all products and innovations matched the tastes of customers and the times - for example, IBM failed to bet on its own OS/2 operating system, Prodigy online services or IBM PCjr computers.
“If your business is built to move forward, you can’t emotionally tie yourself to the past,” Samuel J. Palmisano said.
That’s why IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms – and if they don’t work, then leave them.
Unlike, for example, the competing Microsoft, which basically stands and falls on the Windows operating system.
Perspective technologies
IBM has the largest share of services in its revenues, after about five percent it is made up of software and hardware.
In 1990, with more than half the share, it was the strongest representative of hardware.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-yield assets worth $15 billion, while in the same period it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies.
Investment has continued since 2008, when the modern financial crisis overtook the world for the first time.
IBM is acting on the legacy of its first chief executive, Thomas J. Watson, who also increased investment during the Great Depression.
So far, it seems that IBM is going through the current crisis unaffected.
The price of IBM shares has risen by 120 percent since the beginning of 2008, and the company's net profit is continuously growing.
IBM’s motto is to change everything, but not your values.
Therefore, it can be expected that even if another crisis comes, this flexible giant will manage it.
IBM History: From Cheese Cutter to Space Flight
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York City a hundred years ago, originally under the complex name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
IBM took over the name in 1924 - originally a brand used for the company's branches in Canada and South America.
IBM was founded by a merger of four companies, whose history dates back to the 1980s.
They possessed technologies such as the famous "walkers", i.e. the clocks recording the arrival and departure of the employee.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired the company's supervisory board until 1930.
Flint hired Thomas J. Watson, the head of a rival company, to help him manage the company.
The leader then overshadowed the founders of IBM - Watson's ideas are still built on an invincible corporate culture and identity.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, began with the production and sale of all kinds of machines for business - from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers.
During the first four years of Watson’s leadership, the company’s turnover doubled to $9 million, and the company’s extensive expansion to all continents began.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that after almost forty years in the boss's chair, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence, developing the first programming language.
In the 1960s, people and computers from IBM helped NASA drive flights to space — to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969, the famous human flight to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "pécécéco" that set the computer standard of the time, called IBM 5150, came on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the production of computers to Chinese company Lenovo, on the contrary, bought the consulting part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to devote itself fully to consulting and services with high added value.
The strategy that has paid off in IBM’s last three years is the concept of the Smarter Planet, the “smarter planet”.
Its aim is to make smart use of technologies in previously unplanned areas and to improve the situation, for example in transport or urban management.
IBM recently introduced the “Smarter Commerce” platform to help retailers manage the entire business cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the country.
It founded its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM, the Czech Republic also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Central Office for Central and Eastern Europe is based in Prague and there is also a world-class research team dealing with voice recognition.
Courtesy of an unfaithful husband:
Iveta, keep that donkey, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rycht<0xC3><0xA1>rov<0xC3><0xA1> (53) has ended!
After her husband, Josef Rycht<0xC3><0xA1>r, 53, became not only a protector of Iveta Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1>, 45, but also a lover, Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from the pink dream and return home.
But now she no longer intends to wait and has set clear rules for her next life.
"Pepa can go home, but not as my partner anymore," Rycht<0xC3><0xA1>rov<0xC3><0xA1> explained.
When Darina Rycht<0xC3><0xA1>rov<0xC3><0xA1> granted Barto<0xC5><0xA1> asylum in her home in the summer, she apparently did not even dream of how her marriage would end.
Although Iveta moved out of <0xC5><0x98><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>an at her insistence after 30 days, Pepa did not abandon the singer.
He even admitted publicly that he loved her.
Over time, Darina resigned, reconciled herself to her husband’s relationship, and now she even said goodbye to him forever.
The carpenter doesn't care who his wife sleeps with
If Rycht<0xC3><0xA1>r and Barto<0xC5><0xA1>a were to break up once, the open arms of his wife would not wait for him at home.
"He's the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to live his life in our common home, no one will drive him out."
"But he will live it not as my beloved, wandering old donkey, but as a man with whom I have certain ties," said the judge, saying that she had already detached herself from her husband, insisting only on mutual decency.
Joseph doesn't mind Darina closing the back door for him yet.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Eve and I'm not going to change it."
"The wife has set up a paper marriage, and I respect that."
"The company goes on, I take care of repairs, the garden, the property, I buy."
"Darina and I are having a normal time, except we don't share beds together," Lightning Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> said.
If the judge also finds a new love, he will not defend her.
"We don't sleep together and I don't care where she goes, who she goes with or if she has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take all the responsibility," Josef concluded.
The Worst Habits of Women: Are They Affecting You?
When you ask men if they could name some typical female atrocities, as a rule, all in one is very quickly spilled from the sleeve.
Dear women, do you know yourself in the following lines, where there are several female atrocities that can perfectly pump blood in the veins of men?
Shopping (shopping)
Does your other half blame you for being addicted to shopping?
Do you need to buy at least one cloth per week?
Do you like shopping and buy in bulk at discounts?
Then in your case, you can talk about shopping as an evil habit.
Some women realize that they should at least tame their shopping passion a little bit.
But tell me, who would resist just walking around the clothing stores, looking for well-fitting tops and then trying them all (ideally in different color designs) in the cabin?
Although shopping is a hobby for most women, it can literally become a finished hell for men.
Just remember how many times you've told your friend to wait for you in front of the door...
Continuous dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"I'd need to lose at least five pounds - should I start exercising?"
"Do you like me at all?"
Do these sentences remind you of anything?
Isn't that right?
Then you're one of those women who's obsessed with what they look like.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a lot of men are directly allergic to how their partners constantly complain about their appearance.
The stronger sex also agrees that the higher the frequency of this complaint, the more annoying women are.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an endless round.
Washing windows, vacuuming, wiping tiles, wiping dust, rubbing the bathtub - at least twice a week.
Are you avenging your partner for stepping on a clean tile with a dirty foot, the children for dirtying the ripped-out washbasin and staining the glazed living wall with which you had so much work to do?
In the event that you suffer from this "deviance", try to realize that nothing should be exaggerated and order and cleanliness should definitely not stand within the family in the first place.
This harmless desire for cleanliness can endanger your relationships and family well-being.
Scraping
"Throw those used trainers in the basket."
"Are you going to wear those old socks tomorrow?"
"Wet wipes don't belong on the ground."
If you rub your partner in this way several times a day, know that this way you can reliably turn him.
Of course, you don’t mean it bad, you want to make sure everything is okay.
Maybe if men knew, women wouldn't have to rub in them so much...
Slander, Whispering
For some women, slander, gossip, but also insulting and associating against someone is their own.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
I hope each of us gets some harmless little gossip or blasphemy out there.
Hands on the heart, it's for all women.
On the contrary, however, the murmurs of the coarsest grains, which like and often murmur, perhaps despise everyone and are especially dangerous for their surroundings - mainly within the female working collective.
Jagr and Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek helped with assists to win Philadelphia
Hockey forward Jarom<0xC3><0xAD>r J<0xC3><0xA1>gr took part in Monday’s NHL game with two assists to win the Philadelphia 5:3 on Caroline’s ice and is again at the forefront of Czech players’ productivity in the competition.
From the overview of the thirty-nine-year-old star, Claude Giroux benefited in both cases, who added one more touchdown and was named the best player of the match.
Jagr's teammate Jakub Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek also recorded two assists in the match.
After the match, Jagr told overseas reporters that he had predicted a big night for Giroux.
"Before the game, I told him he'd give a hattrick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes that feeling will overwhelm you," explained Jagr, after whose action Giroux scored a goal from the Flyers' first shot.
A moment later, the team’s second intervention had a Czech footprint.
Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek fought the Hurricanes goal and presented it among the circles to scoring Maxim Talbot.
The second before the first pause was reduced by the weakening of the home player Patrick Dwyer, but the introduction of the second part again belonged to the Flyers.
Specifically, Giroux.
After working with Jagre, he scored the third goal, then turned his shot into a run in the fourth goal by Wayne Simmonds.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely one of the top three," said Jagr.
"I never thought I'd play a hockey player like him at the end of my career."
"I'm glad of that."
"I want to play him."
"All those years in the NHL my teammates have been trying to play me, now it's turning around," Jagr added.
Carolina made a drama out of the match, the goal of Tuom Ruutua and again Dwyer, who pushed through the penalty shootout, got to the difference of one goal.
But Matt Read did not allow any further complication, who ended up renumbering two to one.
"He did a great job in our Pronger zone."
"He pushed off the disc, I picked up the speed and (Read) went to the more distant bar."
"I tried to hit him and I'm glad it worked out," Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek described the final goal of the match from his point of view.
Philadelphia won the Eastern Conference with a victory in the first round.
The Czech defender Jaroslav <0xC5><0xA0>pa<0xC4><0x8D>ek did not win the match against Buffalo, in the second third he retired due to an injury in the upper part of the body.
The Candians lost the lead with a two-arm lead and lost after a 2–3 penalty shootout.
One of their raids did not change Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plekanec.
The home coach was hated rather than the lost points by a large puddle in the back row, with only five defenders playing the match.
"It's bad."
"We only played with one experienced player, the rest were young players."
"But there's nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"The alternation after the alternation was upon us and we could not resist."
"We had to simplify the game more, move the puck out of our zone."
We had gaps in that," added one of the defenders, P. K. Subban.
Czech goalkeeper Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Pavelec contributed thirty touchdowns to Winnipeg’s 5:2 win over Tampou Bay.
The Jets, who broke the five-match losing streak, were shared by five different shooters.
How Travel Prices Have Evolved Since 1989
Until 1989, only five state travel agencies were allowed in Czechoslovakia: <0xC4><0x8C>edok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at that time sold in the overwhelming majority only trips to the countries of the socialist bloc, as travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists thus travelled on holiday to the sea to the GDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimea near the Black Sea), to Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
The bright exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was also possible to travel to Yugoslavia, but then the Yugoslav regime bowed to the West and the journeys of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia were subsequently very limited.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel individually freely even within socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or to the Soviet Union, he needed a letter of invitation from this country, otherwise an individual journey was not possible.
Travel agencies at the time also offered trips to the West, but it was necessary to stand the line overnight with a sleeping bag or have a "well-known" travel agency.
However, it was not won either.
The so-called currency promise, which was a condition for travel to the West, was not given to “politically unreliable people” who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so it was not possible to obtain funds (the Western currency) for a trip to the West without a currency promise.
However, by far the most common Czechs spent their holidays in the country, which resulted in a large number of cottages and chalets that the Czechs had taken and this custom survives to this day.
The travel of the Czechs has experienced a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria were our maxim, last year Czechs spent 4.5 million holidays abroad in countries around the world.
The enormous paradox that we are no longer aware of today is that it was not possible for us to travel freely to the currently most popular Croatia until 1989, since it was part of then Yugoslavia.
At the end of the 1990s, the visa requirement for neighbouring Western European countries was lifted, triggering a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Austria’s Vienna and Germany.
Czechoslovaks could not get tired of trips to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to look there for a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czechs were sleeping in parks in tents, because our income at the time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or guesthouse.
A typical feature of the travel of the Czechs at this time was to drive their own food, canned food, salami, etc. to save money.
Another important moment was the introduction of a freely exchangeable Czech crown, so that our tourists could finally freely buy the western currency after many rainy years.
However, our standard of living and thus our average wages have risen, resulting in another important moment around 1997.
As a result of the increased demand for travel, travel agencies have started to prepare travel regularly since 1997 by charter airlines, which has resulted in an incredible reduction in air travel thanks to the possibility to negotiate quantitative discounts compared to the past.
By the end of the 1990s, Czechs had already had visa-free access to virtually all the developed countries of the world, except the United States, which further facilitated our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary travel occurred in 2000, when, thanks to considerable demand, the Czech Republic was historically the first direct charter flight to exoticism, it was to Thailand.
From this year every year direct charter flights with Czech tourists to warm faraway countries, this winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic to twelve exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are currently visited by around 100,000 Czechs a year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the U.S. abolished the visa for Czech tourists, making our country one of the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, Czechs also spent more than half of their holidays abroad for the first time in history (50.3%) and for the first time in history spent more than CZK 15,000 per person on one foreign holiday, including costs at the place of residence.
The General Assembly has to find a president, but again there is a danger of a pat
For almost five months, Czech football has been without a president and there is a risk that the successor of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek, head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), will not be known after another extraordinary general meeting, which will take place on Thursday in Nymburk.
There is still no agreement on the electoral procedure to be followed.
Without it, it will not even begin to vote on which of the three candidates will be elected.
Interested in leading Czech football are Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k.
Hasek resigned in June and, upon his departure, called on colleagues to unite and find a strong personality who would lead football in the future.
But in the era after The Hague, football slipped back to the gaps between the two union chambers, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
It was fully revealed on September 16, when the new president was to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly came to the National House in Prague at Sm<0xC3><0xAD>chov unnecessarily, because the negotiations remained blocked and it was not just a method of election.
There has also been no agreement on who actually has the right to vote in the assembly - whether only statutory representatives, or even full-power officials.
There has been a partial agreement on this one point since then, and the recommendation of the Constitution for the State and the Law that representation on the basis of full power is not possible has helped.
However, there are still disputes over the electoral system.
The situation has not been brought too clearly to the attention of the Executive Committee, which is no longer dealing with anything else in its proceedings, whether regular or extraordinary.
The view of the option has changed several times, but the neuralgic point is still the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the 3rd round to rule out the possibility of a heel?
"The dispute is whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes, or to find another model," said one of the three vice-presidents of FA<0xC4><0x8C>R Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Svoboda, who represents professional football in the leadership of the association.
According to the statutes of the proposed model in the third round will win the one of the candidates, who will have a higher percentage of support in the chamber for which he is a candidate.
Morava is said to be willing to concede to win a candidate who wins a higher percentage of votes from both chambers.
And the Czech side enforces the condition that the winner must gain at least two-thirds of the preponderance in this percentage.
"Only then would it make no sense to the previous two rounds, it would completely deny the two-chamber concept," he understands the objections of the Moravian Svoboda party, according to which it would be best not to bend and vote according to the current statutes.
Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k agrees with this somewhat surprisingly, even though it is estimated that the electoral order stipulated by the statutes suits Pelt the most of all candidates.
"I would like to vote as much as possible in accordance with the statutes."
"In order not to invent some substitute nonsense as at the last general meeting," said owner Viktoria Plze<0xC5><0x88>, who is running for the first time and in his statements he defined himself primarily against Pelt.
The skin remains optimistic.
In Nymburk, he said, the new president will be known and believes that the candidates will work constructively together in the future.
"All the passions will soothe the possible progress of today's national team at the European Championships."
"Football will be on a happy wave again, there will be a greater willingness to cooperate," says the Jablonec official, who has the greatest experience in managing football at both professional and regional levels.
Rajchl is more restrained.
"I hope for an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is very fragmented."
"It's not between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are attempts to adapt the regulations purposefully."
"It may cause the blocking of the general assembly to happen again."
"But I hope common sense wins," said Rajchl.
There is not much time left for all parties to agree.
Some negotiations were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generality will be complete in the match at all.
An aerial special, in which the Vice-Presidents Dalibor Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era and Rajchl, among others, were to travel to Podgorica, did not leave Prague in the morning due to a technical breakdown and was looking for a replacement option, as part of the executive committee to take the scene of the barricade retaliation of transport.
In the end, there may be a crucial meeting at ministerial level, which is supposed to take place on Wednesday.
Minister of Education, Youth and Sport Josef Dobe<0xC5><0xA1> would like to bring the divided parties within the strongest sports association in the country to an agreement.
There is a lot in the game: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the planned general meeting of <0xC4><0x8C>STV, which will solve the new direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Puck goes to fight for president because he doesn't see a suitable candidate
If the head of footballers Pilsen Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k saw before the extraordinary general meeting a strong candidate who would fulfill all his ideas about the new president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), he would not even enter the fight for the top position.
“If there is a good candidate, I fight for him and I don’t go to the polls.”
"But in the current situation, no one could be found like this," said <0xC4><0x8C>TK Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k.
In a fight with Miroslav Pelta and Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k is motivated to try to prevent Pelt, the alleged favorite of the elections, in the way to the leader of FA<0xC4><0x8C>R.
Paclik also stresses that in case of his victory, he would only stand as president until 2013, when the regular general meeting is on the agenda.
In the role, he would like to see a seasoned and top manager who is not too attached to football events.
"I've talked to some people who might come to mind."
“It was crazy for me when some people said they didn’t even want to identify with Czech football at the moment.”
"I'd like to change that view," he said.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k is now most disturbed by Pelt’s association with the chairman of the Pilsen Regional Football Association Roman Berbra, a man with a controversial reputation known behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the voting of delegates at the general meeting.
It is so unacceptable for Paclik that Pelt should take the presidency.
"If he had won, the current situation would have been preserved and nothing would have moved forward in football."
"Combined with the support of Berbra, who is a good trader, it would not benefit football any more," Paclik said.
He also points to the fact that Pelt's name was mentioned years ago in the aftermath of an investigation into a corruption affair, from which Pelt emerged without punishment.
"I don't know what prestige Pelt's victory would bring to football."
"And what we would look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclik, who is also already taking a look at his former statement that he would "sell the Pilsen club if Pelta became president."
But if Paclik had triumphed in Thursday’s election, he could have imagined future cooperation with Pelta.
Another candidate, Rajchl, whom Paclik supported before the September general meeting, which ended in a fiasco, is also considering.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go after."
"He has great abilities."
"I could imagine him as the head of the national team."
"But managerially he wouldn't be able to manage the association."
"I also don't stick my nose where I can't," said Packl, who in September attracted a lot of attention by being behind the appeal of the arbitration panel led by Lu<0xC4><0x8F>ka Macela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik says he'd have the courage to lead the association.
He refers to his skills in managing private companies, since last summer he also heads Pilsen, which, with his support, celebrated the premier league triumph in May.
"I have the strength to change something in the football environment to contribute to its cultivation."
"To limit the influence of some interest groups, which have a tendency to influence the disciplinary and appeals committee, which deals with unpleasant situations," said Paclik, who does not dislike Spartan leader Daniel K<0xC5><0x99>et<0xC3><0xAD>nski, for example.
He would also consider the strengthening of FACR’s relations with the Czech Olympic Committee as a priority, with the help of which he would lobby political leaders to get more money from the lottery tax into the sport.
"It's one of the key things a new president should be dedicated to."
“If there is a tax on gambling, as the political parties declare, then I understand their arguments, but on the level they have to say where the money will go,” he said.
As a burden, now Paclik does not even take his connection with the Pilsen club, although he himself argues that the president of FA<0xC4><0x8C>R should be "supra-sided".
Pelta is again associated with Jablonec, Rajchl with Prague Duk<0xC5><0x82>a.
"It's not perfect."
"But I don't see any sense in hypocritically transferring my shares to someone at the Pilsen club and going back there in a year and a half," Paclik said.
Pelta promised new FA<0xC4><0x8C>R statutes that would exclude the electoral pat
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, one of the candidates for president Miroslav Pelta promised that if elected, the FARC would have new statutes that would definitively rule out disputes over the electoral rules in the future.
The Jablonec official is optimistic ahead of Thursday's meeting in Nymburk and believes that the pre-election fight will significantly dampen today's success of the football team.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealised election in September that he would concentrate on representation and raising funds in the event of an election.
He decided to go to the last minute before the last general meeting, so a two-month delay could be useful for him to defend his ideas about managing football and present them in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and expect the president to be known on Thursday."
"He feels it's high time someone led the association," said the man, who is primarily associated with the Jablonec club, but who has worked for Sparta and the union's executive committee for many years.
He also believes that he has enough experience to be able to drive Czech football.
He is convinced that the current problems with the election are the euphoria that prevailed during the reign of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“Unfortunately, at the June General Meeting, statutes were passed that were not as perfect as everyone thought.”
"Unless different interpretations were allowed, we have had a chairman since September," Pelta said.
It was the reworking of the most important document of the civic association that he took as a wink to the delegates.
“If I become president, I will take it as a personal task and I am willing to take personal responsibility if it fails.”
"It's a principled thing we can't be without," Pelta says.
He said he is not trying to compete against his opponents.
He had previously announced that he would be able to imagine working with Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rijchl, whom he recognized for his legal education, and he knew well that his vice-candidate would be his first vice-president.
He did not attack Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k for a long time, who, on the contrary, did not leave the skin dry.
"He's been in football for more than a year, he's already had some successes."
“His attacks were unworthy, however, and many people were shocked by the election campaign.”
"That's why many of them now doubt his true character," Pelt, who is said to have remained faithful to the proclamation he announced in September, told the opponent.
His most powerful weapon is his knowledge of football from the lowest competitions to the national team.
It should be a football box.
"And I would also try to end all the affairs, starting with the Bohemians or the echoes of last year's corruption scandal."
"Immediately after that, I would go to negotiations with the private and the state sector to ensure enough money for the whole football," said the forty-six-year-old candidate two months ago.
At the time, he also promised that his coming to the front of the football team would not mean any personnel clean-up.
"I should first get acquainted with the workload of the individual employees," he said to Strahov, where understandable nervousness reigns from a long state of powerlessness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that accompany the general meeting, they believe that delegates will not travel to Nymburk unnecessarily on Thursday.
"If the only point of contention is how he will be elected in the third round, then we can move through it."
“Football needs credibility, and that’s all it gets by finally having its leader again,” Pelta remains optimistic two days before the eventual decisive day of his career.
Rajchl promises that FA<0xC4><0x8C>R will start working hard under him
If the current Vice-President Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl was elected as the new president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at Thursday’s general meeting, many people in the association would not be pleased.
Rajchl promises that in the event of his election, he will start working hard.
It wants to enforce systemic changes and make members of the executive committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the Bohemians' case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work begun by the previous president Ivan Hasek.
"As president, I would like to focus on football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA through to national team, professional football, performance football to youth."
"But I'm not saying I'd do it all by myself," Rajchl said in an interview with <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
“I’m a team player and I want to divide the competencies on the executive committee so that each member is dedicated to a particular area.”
“And I will be handing out hard tasks to make sure that football is a mile ahead in each of these segments.”
"Many people wouldn't be happy about it because it would start to work really hard and not just criticize the work of others," he added.
Due to the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he said he was considering not running again.
“I know I work 20 hours a day.”
"But I need to know that it will make sense and that I will not have people behind me who will constantly throw clubs under my feet and question every step of my life," he said.
"A lot of people told me I couldn't give up because then others would give up."
"That's a trust I can't just throw away," he said.
He is also said to be motivated by the continuation of the work he started with the Hague.
"There's been a lot of work done in those two years and I don't want to throw it away now."
"There are processes that will have a resonance in a few years, and I would not like anyone to stop them," he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, is elected, the situation at the union could return to before the Hague.
"I believe in systematics, and that's something Mirek Pelta doesn't know."
"Behind him are mainly people who would do football so that he would only be chosen for them."
"I can be blamed for a lot of things, but certainly not for being on someone's side."
“I’m trying to be objective.”
"I want to do football for everyone, because then everyone will be fine and not just the chosen ones," Rajchl said.
He also refutes the claim that he was only a Czech president.
"Although some people are trying to say otherwise, I plan to do my best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second league would be divided into the Czech and Moravian parts, the winners of which would go to the first league."
"This would not be the case if there were only three Moravian teams in the league, which is a problem for the young players in Moravia," Rajchl said.
Since the head of the Pilsen club Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k also took part in the fight for the president, Rajchl does not dare to estimate his chances for election.
"But I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its vice president and sees that there are clear successes behind me," said Rajchl, who considers saving tens of millions of crowns on unfavourable contracts, agreements on television contracts and poisoning.
On the contrary, he blames the fact that the union does not pull a single rope.
While he says Pelt is "disqualified from returning confidence to Czech football", the other of Paclik's opponents he considers a strong candidate who has football to offer.
"No one can question that he did a great job in Pilsen that year."
"If he were elected, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Hasek started here and would not fundamentally change the staffing in the commissions."
"He wouldn't want to curl it up in his favor," Rivals Rajchl said.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Jump to Blue
Julia Stanek
A scenic view of Ufona, a luxurious swimming pool in Budapest: Those who travel through Europe can experience their blue miracle - and after a city tour or travel let their tired feet rest in the thermal baths.
The book will show where the wellness by the water is most beautiful.
When Iris Meder spent the past one and a half years on a voyage of discovery, there was no lack in her luggage: her swimsuits.
Lying a hint on the water, she looked up into the height of the artistically shaped domes, swam across from the marble putti (the statue of a little naked boy, a child (with wings)) waiting for her at the edge of the pool, and admired carefully restored artefact floats.
If she liked a swimming pool, she took it to her notebook in no time - even with remarkable details about the way the building was built and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools have been explored in this way by architecture historian Meder and she now presents them in her recently published book "Badefreuden": People's swimming pools in Munich, the historic palace of swimming pools in the Schwarzwald, "The hard core of concrete buildings" in Taunus.
13 countries led her to her "Road to the most unusual spas in Central Europe": in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited locations in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and the Czech Republic.
The 46-year-old German is a true enthusiast of swimming culture.
With sport it is not too much, says Meder - only in the water it is something else.
The only thing to be angry about is that fans of swimming have to settle for blue tiles and the smell of chlorine, while health runners can inhale the dazzling smell of spruce forests or listen to the cheerful whistling of birds in the park.
"One day I asked myself why swimming pools must always be so ugly," says Mrs. Meder, who lives in Vienna.
"So I started collecting nice swimming pools."
The water level is doubling the architecture.
Sprinkling in the jumping pool and essential oils for the sauna - the factor of well-being is therefore so great that it affects all the senses, so much Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders tried, the swimming pools can be a real paste for the eyes: "Instead of the floor, the man has a water level in the spa."
"On the one hand, it is transparent, but on the other hand, it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything doubles optically: high arch, colorful tiles, jumping boards.
The small-format picture book "Badefreuden" provides on 190 pages everything you need to know about the architectural and cultural history of the historic wellness oases - but above all, it arouses the desire to jump into the blue.
Remarkable specimens were discovered by Mrs. Meder, a collector of floats, during her search in Hungary.
In addition to the beautiful medicinal spas, such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi spa in Budapest, she found water containing nitrates in the original karst cave (cave spa in Miskolc-Tapolca) and thermal spas, whose pools are filled with thermal water in the form of a budd<0xC3><0xA1>r in alkaline water and are located
A beautiful view, on the other hand, is offered by many heated swimming pools in the open air in Switzerland and Austria. While one has the whole city in the eye of the Zurich atrium swimming pool, one can watch in the outdoor swimming pool of the spa in St. Anton, which is covered with snow Arlberg - the lake is covered with
Perhaps the most remarkable design of the swimming pool awaits the spa guests in Längenfeld: the <0xC3><0x96>tztal Aquapark looks like the ufo that just landed in the Alps.
From the three open frying pans in winter, the steam rises as it ascends towards the sky in the background of the <0xC3><0x96>tztal Mountains.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool, Mrs. Meder's pool collector's odor of chlorine rose to the boil.
Many thermal baths are smelled of sulphur, in the <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d spas in Békescsab<0xC3><0xA1>, Hungary, it smells of heating oil to the point that one can hardly believe that one has reached the healing baths.
The smell comes from healing water containing alkaline hydrocarbons, which is almost black and whose sediments stick to the skin as soon as a person slips into the pool - a somewhat special wellness experience.
However, one place Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for beautiful spas: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climatic spa Luha<0xC4><0x8D>ovice, she came across a closed area.
In 1902, the spas designed by architect Dusan Jurkovic were closed in the meantime.
When Mrs. Meder looked at the decaying red-white-yellow windows of the Art Nouveau building, she saw how much weed was growing between the tiles.
The destruction took place in the magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
These spas already have three phases of construction; one can discover not only the Neo-Romanesque elements, which originated from the time of their creation in 1844, but also the Moorish Alhambra-style hall, which was annexed around 1900.
Since its careful modernisation in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been a favorite spa resort of the pool expert Mrs. Iris Meder, not only because it comes from the Black Forest.
“It’s already an achievement to combine such diverse building styles into such a beautiful complex,” says Mrs. Meder.
With such a palace, immersion in a thermal pool is probably a marginal matter.
Agricultural Speculation
Deutsche Bank to inspect commodity trades
Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank Leaving Its Agricultural Commodity Trade?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned the working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the poor of the world.
In January, the company’s chief executive wants to see the consequences.
Hamburg -
For federal citizens, the matter is clear: 84% of Germans consider it unacceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn, according to one study.
Two-thirds of respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions withdraw from the deal as it deepens the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, author Harald Schumann shows that betting on global commodity exchanges drives prices up and banks are therefore complicit in the world’s problem of hunger.
The consumer campaign is aimed specifically at Deutsche Bank boss Josef Ackermann, even though big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are doing the same.
Originally, commodity bets were designed to insure traders against price fluctuations.
In the meantime, most experts agree that capital market participants with an interest in high-risk trades have waived supply and demand – and made profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Ackermann responded to criticism: He promised to scrutinize the allegations and said that no trade "is worth putting Deutsche Bank's reputation at risk".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international working group monitors the findings of the Foodwatch-Report.
The audit is due to close by the end of the year, after which the results will be presented to the board of Deutsche Bank - along with recommendations on how to deal with this.
At the end of January, the bank’s executives will announce the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in commodity trade or even a complete rejection.
Ackermann works by himself on his image.
Thilo Bode, head of Foodwatch, welcomed the report, but also reinforced his criticism of the financial sector: "Waiting on rising food prices shows, especially drastically, how recklessly banks are harming the general welfare today."
May Ackermann, as the highest bank lobbyist, fulfill his duties.
“Deutsche Bank must remove from its portfolio all items where money is used to bet on food prices,” Bode said.
"Whether Mr. Ackermann is talking about starving people or the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann’s outlook seems surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the Group CEO would like to leave a perfect picture a few months before he leaves office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the chairman of the board of directors would not be on the supervisory board.
By turning away from controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And he doesn't have to worry about possible losses - his successor should eventually advise on this.
One in two people would stop investing in raw materials.
Foodwatch is trying to keep a high pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published a survey in which the Forsa Institute surveyed 1001 people on November 7 and 8.
Eleven percent said it was legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments linked to food price bets.
Many customers of banks would also derive personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such trades: each other would, as a result of a survey, terminate all investments in which money flows into speculation with raw materials.
43% would warn a familiar to such a bank, 49% said they would consider termination of their account and move to another institution.
21st century house in Vienna
The relocated pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
The history of architecture with peaks, falls and happy endings: The Austrian pavilion at the 1958 World’s Fair in Brussels won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, remained empty and emptied.
Now it is reopened as an exhibition house.
When it burns for modern post-war architecture, for clear forms, glass halls, bold impulses and new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels World Exhibition is excellent and pleasurable.
Schwanzer’s pavilion was awarded the Grand Prix d’Architecture for its lightweight and impressive steel and glass construction.
The building is still considered to be the milestone of the current architecture.
He famously built the Austrian pavilion for the next world exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder BMW Palace plus as a key made by the side construction in Munich, it finally became internationally famous in 1973.
As a temporary exhibition building, the pavilion designed after the World Exhibition was placed in the Schweizer Garten near the Vienna Südbahnhof (South Railway Station), renovated and in 1962 opened the Museum of the 20th century - it was named the "House of the 20th Century".
But the building was not suitable for the museum, either spatially or technically - there were no walls for hanging art exhibits, no suitable climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art reached a new stand in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has been increasingly occupied.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has reconstructed the pavilion, now called the "House of the 21st Century" and will be used in the future as a Museum of Contemporary Art.
On Tuesday evening there will open the Museum Belvedere, to which the palace belongs, the first exhibition - a happy intention in every respect.
Agnes Husslein-Arco is the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, a promoted art historian with a distinguished career, e.g. in her youth as a figure skater, later in Sotheby's, Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, strongly promoted the reconstruction of the museum among politicians and monuments.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be exhibited by the eponymous foundation, a café and a bookshop should be established, and an office building must be built for this purpose.
Strict supervision, low budget.
Krischanitz was then the ideal cast to perform.
Not only did he sensitively reconstruct and expand Joseph Olbrich's Art Nouveau buildings in Vienna and win the competition, but because he studied at Schwanzer's Technical University in Vienna and the pavilion was an "immensely important place" for him, where he spent "almost every weekend".
He knew the original project and also knew the problems of the building, which had already lost its generosity and lightness when it was moved to Vienna and changed its use.
With the current reconstruction, there were much bigger problems: the building was a "catapult for energy," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade were replaced, glass fiber reinforced insulating glass was used and the glass roof was replaced by a special safety glass.
Cold bridge-steel beams were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings were refurbished.
Two underground floors provided space for new use, a recessed lighting channel between the building and the street provides lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still a grand Schwanzer pavilion.
The original entrance door has been preserved, the building is painted in an old anti-corrosion reddish-brown color tone.
And the cinema is still exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under the strict supervision of the monumental office and a low budget.
"Often, material had to be found that was good and cheap and also liked the monumental office," says Krischanitz, pointing to the broken basement floor.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reconstruction, the building remained flexible and airy.
It was said to be difficult with the pavilion “which came here from Brussels,” Krischanitz said recently, a typical “Drop-in-the-City-history.”
Such an architecture is said to be “always in the wrong place” and still wants to “be of proper self-confidence”.
In this case, however, the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because an urbanistic happy coincidence happened: In the circuit around the Schweizer Garten, a completely newly designed "City Quarter at the Main Station" with office and residential houses is created.
And perhaps there is another happy coincidence: the 21st century house could receive support from another Krischanitz building, because collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and as you hear, she is already negotiating with the city about a neighborhood at a residence in the Schweizer Garten.
Railway plans a package for the winter crisis in the amount of a million
The railway has devised a crisis plan to prevent train crashes in the winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
It'll cost millions.
In the fight against the cold caused by train failures and delays, Deutsche Bahn is spending more than 70 million euros in newspapers this year, according to the report.
The newspaper "Bild" brought a preliminary report, citing the internal group plan, that is expected to total investments of about 300 million euros by 2015.
It is intended to improve the utilisation of trains and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the number of internal and external employees to 16,000 people to remove snow on railway facilities and platforms.
The goal is to get rid of the start-up platform and 90 percent of the necessary shifts during four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, the head of the Rüdiger Grube railway warned of train failures and delays after meeting at the highest level with government and industry representatives during the winter.
In the last winter period, the track had considerable problems in passenger transport, because, among other things, in difficult weather conditions, it had a shortage of reserves.
Thus, numerous new regional trains have been waiting for approval by the Federal Railway Authority for years.
In addition, there are delays in the operation of ICE trains
The railway has also been unable for years to control the ICE trains’ axles more often when a single ICE train at Cologne’s main railway station destroyed the axle.
Deutsche Bank pays a million dollar fine in the United States
After the turmoil around CEO Josef Ackermann, there are new trampolines in the U.S.: Deutsche Bank has to pay millions of reparations there.
As if Deutsche Bank had not had enough problems at home, a giant in the industry still catches up with its past in the US: The Frankfurt institution pays $145 million (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>106 million) in a settlement procedure to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgages.
The NCUA financial market regulator blames a number of large banks for seducing cooperative banks with false promises to buy financial products; that they have probably reduced the risks.
Such papers lost much of their value during the crisis and plunged banks into the abyss with them.
“We are pleased that we were able to resolve the issue without having to drag the parties to court,” a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in New York said.
The bank does not admit any guilt by settlement.
This also applies to Citigroup, which has committed to paying out $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the support of both monetary institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for cooperative banks in the U.S. and assists in bankruptcy to protect customer claims.
The NCUA is seeking compensation for billions of dollars in damages.
Now the finalized settlements are the first of their kind.
The regulator also clung to other major banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
Mortgage-backed securities are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on bank loans.
When the U.S. real estate bubble burst in 2007, it became a fateful fate for a number of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, US-Investmentbank Lehman Brothers changed its mind.
Even though the events took place a few years ago, the banks are now facing a fierce wind.
Investors and supervisory authorities have filed numerous lawsuits to seek redress or aggravate the error.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has launched the largest wave of lawsuits.
He denounces 18 international major banks that two U.S. state financiers dealing with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s real estate in mortgage deals worth about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has to face the FHFA lawsuit, with more transactions totalling about $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority demands that the Frankfurt Institute be held accountable for "substantial losses", without, of course, specifying any exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the claims as unfounded and said it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett to Join IBM with $10 Billion
Finance guru Buffett is investing heavily in IBM.
Since March, it has purchased more than $10 billion worth of shares.
Warren Buffett has always said that he will not invest in IT and computers because the long-term development of companies can only be difficult to predict.
But now he has read IBM’s business reports and changed his mind about investing in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM primarily offers services and acquires computer systems for IT departments of other companies.
Warren Buffett's investment in the financial world is considered a knighthood.
As a result, IBM's parent company can now be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett told CNBC that he had bought IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
Berkshire Hathaway became one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said that even IBM did not know anything about his involvement.
He praised the management, who even sought to make a decent return during the economic crisis.
"You did a great job," Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has been betting for a long time on lucrative IT services such as the operation of computer centers.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful computers for businesses.
Buffett has been avoiding tech companies to this day.
He says he only invests in companies whose activities he understands.
Instead, Buffett hit the freight rail, the lubricant manufacturer, or the machine manufacturer.
His holding Berkshire Hathaway owns more than 80 own subsidiaries and also shares in a number of large corporations such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly the Municher Rück.
The 81-year-old took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and built one of the most valuable businesses in the world with wise investments.
Yet his way of life is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of making money earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha" (The Miracle of Omaha).
When Buffett’s investment became known, IBM’s stock rose by one percent before the stock market began.
“Big Blue,” as IBM is also called, has a total price tag of more than $220 billion on the stock exchange and is considered, along with Apple and Microsoft, the world’s most valuable technology companies.
But at Microsoft, so much Buffett, he wouldn't want to perform.
Bill Gates is said to be a close friend.
The threat is tangible.
After the unveiling of "The Cells in Zwickau", Turkish media question the German rule of law.
The newspapers are even talking about a “bloody ideology” that is now reviving.
The murders of eight small businessmen of Turkish origin and one Greek between 2000 and 2006 had a far-right extremist background.
This report was reacted with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany.
For many German Turks, this brings back the ghost that has long been considered dead: since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence against the right-wing extremist background.
There was never any doubt about the existence of xenophobia in Germany.
However, the discovered right-wing extremist network reveals an extent that has long been untraceable.
"Is the bloody ideology coming to life again?" read the headlines of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, stresses that one of the perpetrators was supposed to be a secret police agent of the constitutional protection unit and fears that German authorities could also be involved in a right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish municipality of Germany reacted cautiously: It recalled the weekend of the demonstrations by silence in front of the Brandenburg Gate victims of racist violence.
Only two weeks ago, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In cheerful colors, a life together was staged - as a success story.
As a box here is the news of several Turkish media: "Germany's gift to the fifties" is the headline of an article in the Turkish online platform "Haber X", which refers to the background of the murder series.
Also the publication of the paper "Hürriyet" for Germany can not be taken, so as not to carry out this idea connection.
"It's starting to stink," reads the column titled by Ahmet Külahci.
It stresses that people who paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany were murdered.
Most critically is discussed in German-Turkish Internet forums the police's progress and its late success in the search.
Why didn’t the German authorities think much earlier to search for suspects in right-wing extremist circles, the authors wonder.
Thus, many are at least rhetorically ready to use drastic means: "If action continues to be carried out here so superficially, immigrants will have nothing but their own defense and armament."
"That'll probably be the best self-defense."
"The quality of clarification and the proportionality of the punishment of the entire network very strongly depends on the internal peace in Germany," Selen writes.
Which means, if the internal peace in Germany is threatened, the assassinations in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s explain.
The photo of the incineration site in Solingen is deeply engraved in the memory of the Germans and Turks.
For no other event has made it clearer to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat and to the Germans that distrust and distance can result in right-wing violence.
However, the attacks made a sense of reciprocity more visible on the side of the Turks.
Do not repeat past mistakes
In the Turkish press, the failure of German politics after the assassinations was criticized: Helmut Kohl refused to visit those in Mölln who survived.
After the Solingen arson attack, he sent a sympathetic telegram to the Turkish president, but had his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel present at a mournful ceremony in Cologne - Kinkel then in his speech calculated what fees the Turks gave.
It is as if the value of a person is measured by the amount of his taxes.
The current news of the Turkish media shows once again how deep the distrust of many German Turks in the state-legal arrangement here is.
In addition to efforts to clarify widely and re-evaluate far-right terrorism in Germany, this time it requires open words.
Scandalous bank by Lake Zurich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not headquartered in Italy or France, but rather in Switzerland.
UBS has almost gone bankrupt during the financial crisis and has since moved from one crisis to another.
Now a German has to deal with it.
Axel Weber certainly didn’t think so.
After his noisy departure from the leadership of the Federal Bank, it became known in July that he would enter an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013: the president of the board of directors of the Swiss large bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber looked forward publicly, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidity, and made friendly remarks to future colleagues.
"Die UBS has achieved turnover".
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
But in September, it was clear that everything was going to be different.
A UBS dealer in London bypassed all of the bank’s security systems and squandered about 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, not only a recognized banker in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the chairman of the board of UBS has also seemed to be in a bad mood – and everyone is asking: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has already become known that Weber can advise the bank since February 2012.
And the chairmanship of the board of directors will take over already in May - not only in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
It's going to be tough for Axel Weber.
He’s not a banker, he’s a professor of economics and an emission banker, and he’d certainly need time to work.
He then assumes responsibility for the bank’s strategy, which has just proven once again that it deserves the title “Bank of the Greatest Scandals in Europe”.
Because UBS is huge - until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world - and it has been sliding from one scandal to another for years.
Nothing, it seems, will be spared the proud Swiss bank.
It started with the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS enjoyed an excellent reputation.
The image of a silent and solid, but also clever asset manager is combined with ambitious goals: She also wanted to mean something in investment banking.
In 2007, UBS managed, on the one hand, $1.6 trillion more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it has moved on as an investment bank to the league of the world's largest banks.
That made an impression.
Former banker and later long-time professor of banking in Zurich, Hans Geiger, says: "I always used UBS as a model of good banking for my students back then."
“From today’s perspective, one asks, ‘How could I have been so wrong?’
He was very wrong.
For the first time in 2007, it was clear that something had gone wrong at UBS.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, the chairman of the board of directors, resigned as a highly intelligent and brilliant banker.
A few months later, he knew why he had left.
The bank’s investment division wasted Subprime papers and had to write off billions.
In order to stabilize this, UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs.
But she did find investors, of course, over whom she would have recently covered her nose: an opaque Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund that was so discreet that one did not even know its name.
But it was only the first hit.
In April 2008, it was worse.
The bank had to admit new billion-dollar losses, with CEO Marcel Ospel, Switzerland’s second highest-paid board of directors, resigning in 2006.
In October 2008, there was a disaster: UBS had to be saved by the state due to its misinvestment in the financial crisis.
The Nationalbank bought out UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs on obligatory exchangeable bonds, for which it could become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - for it had noticed how dramatic it was for a small country when it had such large banks on its territory.
After all, the balance sheet total of UBS 2007 was more than five times the performance of the Swiss economy (see figure).
“Once again, we could not save UBS,” says banking expert Geiger.
The first disaster is followed by the second.
For several months now, UBS has capitulated in a tax dispute with America and has expressed willingness to release data to wealthy customers who have, if possible, cut taxes with the help of banks.
In addition, she agreed to pay out $780 million – as a refund of unauthorized profits from these trades, including a fine surcharge.
In doing so, UBS learned more or less openly that it helped cut taxes.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in the competition for rich clients: the shrine of discretion.
After this scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer what it used to be.
This was followed by the resignation of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customers' money.
Thus, the bank lost its credibility over the course of several months in both central business areas: in investment banking due to bad speculation and in asset management to help cut taxes.
And just when it calmed down a bit, just when it was thought that UBS had recovered again, here comes this unfortunate business crash: The only dealer squandered 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed that something was wrong.
And it’s clear: with risk management in investment banking, that still doesn’t seem to work.
“In the case of Adoboli, I think risk control has changed too little,” says Martin Janssen, an economist and finance professor at the University of Zurich’s Banking Institute.
The CFO of a large German bank is also certain: "The problem with UBS is that it can't control risks."
But it was precisely the idea of caution that Swiss bankers took long ago to become guardians of the world's great assets: no too great a risk, but security for money - also on this side of the Alps the world collapsed again.
Swiss banks’ vaults have become a symbol of unshakable reliability like Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly high-quality chocolate.
The headquarters of UBS in Zurich still fits the cliché of a good Swiss private bank - it's just a little bigger.
The location is classic.
The bank is headquartered in the Bahnhofstraße in Zurich, which leads directly to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, the rental shops are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellery such as Tiffany's can be found here among Swiss traditional shops such as the Sprüngli confectionery.
Swiss banks have been based here for centuries: from the Nationalbank through the Palais der Credit Suisse to elite private banks like Julius Bär.
The UBS reception hall is accessed by heavy swivel doors.
Inside, the walls are lined with marble, in front of them stand huge leather chairs, next to the logo of the bank a large direction to the "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for: security.
This idea of the Swiss banks, however, was sometimes suppressed or betrayed by both Swiss big banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds out.
His name would rather not be read in the newspapers, he eventually closes, like all Swiss bankers, also with both major banks.
UBS has probably grown too much, it finds - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have also expanded.
I don't think the Swiss have anything more to say about it.
"And if they did, they would have adapted to the Anglo-Saxon ways long ago."
Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, brought it high profits and then disaster: No European financial institution lost as much money in the jungle around Subprime as the Schweizer Großbank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster was obvious.
"On Wednesday, the government coalition of a small country of seven million decided on the largest rescue action in the history of its nation," author Lukas Hässig writes in his book "The UBS-Crash."
As many as 68 billion francs, or about 45 billion euros, have been approved by politicians to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could this have happened?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, you see the problem primarily in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of Switzerland’s three major banks merged into a large group.
A bank was formed, which was already too big for a small Switzerland at the time of the merger – and it continued to grow.
It helped that the two different banking predecessors of UBS complemented each other: a rich but dormant bank in Zurich with a focus on asset management and a poorer but more internationally involved bank.
All of a sudden, internationalized investment bankers came up with a lot of money that they could spin big roulette with.
There are two names associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS Group from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were the team of the future,” says banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffle, the highly intelligent, modest, who knows a lot about models and statistics, and Ospel, the man who manages the feelings around his stomach, who has worked out from banking science all the way up."
But Ospel relied on Wuffli in the end.
And in the end, Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: "I guess he thought his models were real," Geiger says.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, I suppose.
It is clear that pride preceded the fall.
UBS employees clearly remember the meetings of executives at which CEO Wuffli repeated the same slogan over and over again: Beat Goldman Sachs from the throne down.
The U.S. Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
It featured the League Tables, a schedule that documented the success of the banks of that time.
In it, UBS tried to position itself at the top.
A few steps have already been taken.
In the foreign exchange and equities trade, she participated in the game at the top.
However, the business advisors who were commissioned emphasize one weakness: In international interest rate trading, in the speech of the bankers "Fixed Income", there is probably a large gap behind the largest banks.
UBS has some gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
In order to close this gap, UBS set out on an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and its fund-based hedge fund invested in U.S. Subprime investments.
It developed into a powerful machine that repackaged securities into U.S. mortgages and passed them on – but also kept the risks on its own.
Even when other banks were looking for a way out.
“As early as the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was on fire, UBS was buying there,” says banking expert Geiger.
As great as the euphoria is, so deep is the fall.
One manager after another had to leave when attempts to clean up were more difficult than thought.
Positions at UBS have become a catapult seat and to this day are hovering.
Whoever runs the big bank now has an almost unmanageable job.
He has to find a strategy for the bank that all the close business models have disappeared.
Banking expert Geiger already has an idea: End investment banking, focus on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
That’s not how far the bank wants to go.
But investment banking is about to drop sharply, so much is now clear.
On Thursday, the new head of the bank Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Swiss Italian was only seen as a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly broke up with its predecessor, Grübel.
In the meantime, he has insisted that he should run UBS's business for a long time, the Zurich bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to its position in the mid-1990s.
3,500 seats will be cut.
But that's not gonna be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does he want to make money from?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is already asking himself.
But so far he has only said that he and his wife will first find an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.

"We're not an island, we're dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman.
Europe will probably not recover so quickly from the recession, and there are other signs of weakness in banks.
The investment legend Warren Buffett just confirmed this view: He said in a CNBC interview that it might not be clear yet if Europe is strong enough to do anything to end the crisis.
Therefore, from his point of view, it is probably too early to invest in European government loans or banks.
Instead, Buffett abandoned the decades-old principle and entered the American technology industry.

Smart crows are spreading in cities
In many places, field crows are considered "problem birds": However, these highly intelligent animals can no longer be evicted from cities, experts say.
Some like them, others would like to get rid of them quite quickly: Crows have belonged to the image of the city for centuries, yet in some municipalities, complaints of residents about impurity and noise caused by animals are accumulating.
However, there is no way to deal with "problem birds" yet.
Field ravens can no longer be ejected from cities, experts said at the first symposium on ravens in East-Friesland Leer.
There, experts from all over the federal territory were consulted on possible starting points.
Looking for alternatives in cities
Conservationists have also derived the problems of cities from the exodus of specially protected field ravens: the use of chemistry in agriculture is probably increasingly destroying traditional areas for life.
Persecution, growing planting and cutting down typical trees for nesting birds make life difficult.
Crows are protected.
Large colonies with more than 600 nesting pairs are located in Westphalia's Soest, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen and Leer.
There, in 2005, a controversial project of mass killing of crows in the rural district caused negative headlines.
Critics have called the capture of animals in bird traps and the killing of sticks particularly brutal.
"Normal expulsion, fear, nothing brings," urbanist and landscaper Werner Klöver of Leer found.
Removing nests by splashing water or chopping trees often has undesirable consequences, environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg said.
"Animals are retreating, large colonies are splitting up and splitting up into other places."
Scaring is only conceivable as an exception in hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them away anymore."
Without the surrounding territory, the problem of cities cannot be solved, was the opinion of the mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
Imaginable is the combination of evicting animals from sensitive residential areas and attracting them to settle elsewhere.
"Information boards instead of chain saws" was promoted by psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens, on the other hand, because of a completely different treatment of animals: "One tingling in the face is the best way to end up with self-confidence."
Ms. Jürgens co-founded the Ascherberg Science Crow Trail in Schleswig-Holstein, on which information boards provide lessons on the life of the highly intelligent field crow.
The project has already been accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also had her own opinion on the criticism of the noise caused by birds: "It's about every volume of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and craftsmanship of animals are legendary: Field ravens not only use a tool to achieve pleasure, but even as a tool they make their instrument.
Researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested the behavior of four field ravens on how far bird intelligence can go.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that the stones must cause the structure to collapse in order to get to the larvae.
Without much training, they knew what size and shape the stone must have to cause the platform to collapse.
In the second attempt, the crows then had to solve the more glaring problem.
In a vertically built cylinder, researchers placed a small container with a larva of the pier.
The birds could not reach their prey with a toothbrush.
However, the researchers placed pieces of wire there.
From them all four animals formed hooks, with the help of which, as a sighting, they hunted from the tube a container for a holder.
Three of the four field ravens managed to do so even with a swarm.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal for 2012 European Championship
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks for the cup did not come to fruition.
Favorites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and Ireland are participating in the 2012 European Championships.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have won the last tickets to the 2012 European Championships in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.
Led by twice-successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made it perfect after a 0:0 result in the first match of the fifth in a row in the European Championship.
Czechs in the play-off with the outsider <0xC4><0x8C>ern<0xC3><0xA1> Hora had a score of 1:0 (0:0), when the first match was a clear thing.
Branka did not even give up Croatia with 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland achieved a freed 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored more goals for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg professional Zvjezdan Misimovic (41.) and captain Emir Spahic (65.) reduced twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic received a yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia has already disappointed in the play-offs to the 2010 World Cup in South Africa with Portugal.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal started at peace.
Ronaldo soon reached the lead by hanging a free kick from about 30 meters into the net.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his quality in long-distance shooting and adjusted the 25-metre hit to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who failed in the first half, had their first clear chance in goalkeeper Edin Dzek.
Former Wolfsbourne player from England at the head of the standing table of Manchester City settled the header on the bottom edge of the board, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek scores for Czech Republic
Finally, the referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding was at the centre.
After the operation against Helder Postig in Bosnian criminal territory, Stark decided for Schwalbe and awarded the Portuguese a yellow card. (36.).
On the other side, Stark made a controversial penalty kick after the action of Fabio Coentra, which Misimovic transformed with certainty.
But after the break, the 2004 European Vice-Chancellor clarified everything with four hits.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also finished the last doubt in the 81st minute.
With this, the 1976 European Champion leaves for the fifth time in a row for the European Championship.
However, the team of coach Michal Bilk with Bundesliga legionnaire Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) were also lucky and had to overcome a terrible second already at the initial stage.
Branc<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech prevented reflexively in the last possible moment own branc<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Sivok (9th).
Montenegro had its best chances when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic fired in the 40th minute from a turn from the border of the criminal territory just around the <0xC4><0x8C>echova goal.
After the break, the crossbar had to save the place of the already crushed goalkeeper of the Czechs of world class, again reduced the striker FC Seoul (50th).
Shortly before the conclusion, Branka finally clarified everything.
At that moment, Turkey missed a football miracle from Zagreb.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not exceed 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink is almost certain to free up his seat on the bench of the third at the 2002 World Cup, Croatia can rejoice in its fourth participation in the final round of the European Championships.
In front of 31,000 spectators at Maksimir Stadium, the Turks should experience an almost fairy-tale start.
Selcuk Inan hit only a pole in the seventh minute with a shot from a distance, the striker Kazim also could not hang the reflected ball in the goal.
After this terrible second, however, Croatia was increasingly taking control.
Also after the interruption, the Croats did not get the goal.
In addition to Mario Mandzukica of the VfL Wolfsburg, who released Ivan Perisica from the 62nd minute, there were also Legionnaires from the Bundesliga Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt).
Trapattoni goes to the European Championships
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated the first participation in the European Championships since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led Giovanni Trapattoni's team to the lead in the 32nd minute with a 4:0 success in the first game.
Konstantin Vassilev (57th) equalised for the guests.
Ireland set the pace from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy had his first good chance.
It was only at the last minute that Estonian defence prevented a possible leader of the goal.
But in the 32nd minute, it was a long way off.
After the failed defense of goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was in place and pushed the ball over the line to a 1:0 state.

SAP wants to double the number of its employees in China.
Europe’s largest software maker SAP is investing billions in China over the next few years and wants to nearly double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, it is said to be about two billion dollars (approximately 1.5 billion euros), Dax Group said on Tuesday.
“We will build additional research and development facilities and employ the right people,” said Deputy Chief Executive Officer Bill McDermott at a customer fair in Beijing.
The workforce has now grown from its current 2,500 employees to 4,500.
The number of the world’s leading companies in business software doubles from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4,000 of the world’s more than 176,000 SAP customers are experiencing a boom in the country.
The growth plans in China are also an important building block of Dax’s 2015 strategy.
SAP plans to increase its sales to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion by 2015.
Last year, the Walldorfers raised around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>12.5 billion.
Currently, there are shops for a software manufacturer, which employs 55,000 employees worldwide, as well as almost never before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Now we would like to expand our activities (...)," McDermott said.
“Our goal is, with the support of extensive research, to promote sustained growth in China.”
Massacre on a personal level
Peter Englund’s emotionally powerful new book Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War begins with a long list of prominent characters that turns your head.
One piece of advice on how to keep up at the moment: Carefully pull out this page and make a bookmark out of it.
You will get to know all the people in Mr. Englund's novel story very well, and this list will serve as a navigational guide - like a beacon - at a time when, like the men and women in the story, you will feel confused and lost in different situations.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also a new deputy to the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
The book we are talking about here is very unusual - the author himself describes it quite aptly, as "an antihistorical work".
It contains several very well-known names, important treaties or famous battles, on the contrary, it almost lacks ambassadors, energetic journalists and debates about tactics and equipment.
It is not so much a book about what happened, explains the author, as rather "a book about what it was like". It deals mainly with "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and Grief" combines the war experiences of 20 less than a dozen men and women, on both sides of the barricade, from students and botanists to climbers, doctors, rescue drivers and officials.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Others will become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go crazy, or die.
Their lives flicker like the flames of candles lit in the church - new ones are added to the web of fate, while others are extinguished.
Mr. Englund’s book is different from classic historical novels.
It corrects the notion that World War I was all about the terrifying trench battles on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Grief" skilfully explores other places where war dramas took place: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book solve problems with falling bee nests on them, having to spend Christmas in the shadow of pyramids or struggling with the presence of tse-tse flies.
From the very beginning, it was a very touching read.
War will devour people's lives like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina smelling of gunpowder.
When gunfire starts to ring in the distance and you are the woman who is at home with your children, will you run away or stay?
Who's actually getting close?
Almost no one understands what is going on, not even why the whole war was started.
“The vacuum created by the lack of facts,” observed Mr. Englund, “was filled with speculations, conjectures, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors.”
"Beauty and Grief" follows the stories of individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are all taken from biographies, letters and other materials already published.
Descriptions of their lives may sound frightening and compelling, but with the inclusion of tiny moments and details, they are absolutely vivid and believable.
Many of them talk about suffering and coping with it.
In the story of a German student, the author says: "Replacements, everywhere the same substitutes."
"Coffee substitute, aluminum imitation, rubber imitation, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He goes even further and describes food substitutes in Germany.
It mentions "meat made from pressed rice cooked in scop fat (and supplemented by a fake bone made of wood), tobacco from dried roots and dried potato peels, shoes with wooden soles".
It mentions that there were "837 registered meat substitutes in the production of sausages and 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
One American finds within himself the inner urges to savagery and brutality, and declares of war: "At last you will understand that this is precisely human nature. Not to sit in comfortable chairs with cigars and whiskey, not to pose with this evening newspaper or a good book of yours, and not to pretend to be a barbarian.
On the contrary, the British soldier realizes that he is most likely to die soon and no one will even notice, let alone grieve.
“When one finally reconciles himself with sacrifice, one would expect it to be so in the eyes of a grateful audience,” he writes.
Instead, he feels like a “convict who is being secretly hanged.”
Other remarks relate to the departure of the old Europe and the emergence of new horrors.
"Conflict has increasingly become an economic competition and a competitive struggle," writes Mr. Englund, "a war between factories."
He captured what he says is "a new kind of beast of the coming century: an eloquent and ideologically committed mass murderer in tailor-made dress who performs his bloodshed without getting up from the table."
People behave completely unexpectedly, ugliness alternates with heroism.
Mr. Englund also describes soldiers who deliberately tried to catch a sexual disease from prostitutes in order to avoid service on the front lines.
"The worst example of this behavior was the trade in gonokok pus that soldiers bought and used to fight their genitals in the hopes of ending up in a hospital," he writes.
"The most desperate rubbed it in their eyes, often blinding them for the rest of their lives."
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Mr Englund's prose is succinct, but in no way obvious, which fits perfectly with his human subject.
In dozens of small outputs, it captures the way the war “dissolved absolutely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.”
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are forcing them to fight.
The best books on the First World War mostly worked with hints rather than complex narratives, such as "World War I and Modern Memories" by Paul Fussell or novels such as "On the Western Front Peace" by Erich Maria Remarque.
Mr. Englund prefers an unconventional concept.
His book has the most overwhelming endings that are unparalleled in popular scholarly literature.
But I won't tell you.
However, you will feel as if the author suddenly jumped out of the book, ripped a page from your list of heroes from your hand and set it on fire.
After the previous mistake, this time a minute precisely planned rush
It was attended by hundreds of police officers, some in helmets used in street riots.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because at that time Zuccotti Park should be almost empty.
No one knew about the event except a few high-ranking officers; the rest were first told that it was an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the forefront of the operation, whose presence emphasized how many problems the police department had to face during the operation.
Cases of recent weeks, for example, when pepper sprays were used against demonstrators, were not allowed to repeat, thus violating the rules of the department and, in addition, a wave of public sympathy spilled over to the side of the squatters.
Therefore, a police operation aimed at clearing Zuccotti Park of demonstrators was launched only after two weeks of careful planning and exercise.
Leaders were inspired by the operations that took place in other cities.
Massive emergency behavior exercises took place in the Randalls Island area, which was a preparation for action in Zuccotti Park.
Leading officials have stepped up so-called riot suppression training — counterterrorism measures involving the rapid relocation of large numbers of police officers — with a focus on the urban part of Lower Manhattan.
The last part of the training took place on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to move to the park came literally "at the last minute", someone told me, to whom the action was originally explained only as "exercise".
"I know a few police officers who have also been called to this event, and no one has told them that they are going to Zuccotti Park," said the person, who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
"Only the highest-ranking members of the department knew that it was going to Zuccotti Park."
One of the reasons for the secrecy was a lesson that the city had already learned.
On October 14, the city officials were scheduled to clean up the park, but then withdrew from the plan, because as soon as the demonstrators heard about it, hundreds of people flocked to the park before the operation began.
Tuesday's actions were attended by police officers from various units, including intervention groups from around the area - dozens of police officers who are commonly used to strengthen neighborhoods with higher levels of crime.
Mr. Kelly explained that during the day a large number of people come and go to the park, so one hour at night was the ideal time to start the event.
"It was appropriate to do this at a time when there would be as few people as possible in the park," he said.
Before the troops left, they lined up on the edge of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, with emergency trucks with arc lamps and amps.
Lights and a recorded message roaring from the Ambientos frightened many demonstrators.
When members of the police force entered the park in their blue windshields, many demonstrators packed their belongings and left.
Police say they didn’t touch a single tent until 1:45 a.m. to give protesters time to pack their belongings.
Other teams of police officers were spotted gathering at the edge of the park so they could infiltrate it if any arrests were to be made.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Police chief spokesman Paul J. Browne said it was for their safety.
However, many journalists are of the opinion that the police wanted to prevent them from seeing her units in action, and in addition, some police officers behaved rudely towards them.
Mr. Browne claimed that the television cars on Church Street leading along the park’s western boundary could shoot without problems.
Police proceeded westward and intertwined with a dense mix of protestors’ personal belongings, including suitcases and needle bags full of clothes, followed by teams from the sanitation department, who immediately squandered everything that was left in the park.
Some demonstrators, who refused to move, were dragged out of the park. Documentary footage appeared shortly thereafter on the Internet.
The largest group of demonstrators retreated to the kitchen near their camp, which was near the center of the park.
Some created a barrier and the police began their methodical arrest.
About ten people in the center of the camp tied up with each other.
And two people were tied to the tree, Mr. Kelly said.
Members of the emergency services were summoned to cut through the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The entire operation was completed about 75 minutes later, police said.
Mr Browne said about 142 people were detained in the park.
Most of the arrests were due to “organization of riots and resistance to arrests,” he said.
The highest-ranking police officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the commander of the police department, the highest-ranking uniformed officer in the department.
The operation was also personally attended by Phil T. Pulaski, Chief of Detectives at the Department.
Mr. Kelly was present but "did not participate in the operation," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of police officers were waiting along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case it needed to be called.
Barriers were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and Pine Street, a block south of the park.
From these places, the police developed a protective belt even further from Zuccotti Park.
In one place, police officers were seen, many of whom were equipped with shields, pushing people even further beyond this border.
There were about 28 people on the northern border.
The most wild events of the night took place south of the park.
Around five o'clock in the morning, a demonstrator south of Pine Street was seen jumping on the hood of a police car, and several others were seen venting from the tires of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
At the end of the operation, one policeman and one protester were hospitalized.
The union of auxiliary workers will sue the city for dismissal
On Wednesday, unions representing hundreds of school aid workers who lost their jobs last month are planning to sue the city, saying layoffs were not necessary and were discrimination because of the disproportionate impact on schools attended by poor students.
The judicial review is probably the last option left for the District Council 37 trade unions in their effort to reverse the dismissal decision.
On October 7, six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parental coordinators and other employees, who were among the city's worst-paid employees, lost their jobs. Their dismissals were described by union leaders as a retribution for the city's inability to access health care last spring.
The city’s officials categorically denied the accusation.
At a city council meeting last month, education minister Dennis M. Walcott said the dismissal was part of a budget approved in June.
One of the members of the council immediately countered by saying that there was no specific mention of the dismissal of auxiliary staff in the budget.
District Council 37 officials have already filled out the necessary documents and warned the education ministry that they will sue him. They will convene a press conference on Wednesday where they will formally announce a lawsuit before the Supreme State Court in Manhattan.
The defendants in the trial will be Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education, while the plaintiff will be eight laid off workers, all of whom are African-American or Hispanic, as well as most of the other assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s legal department, said the city had not yet seen the lawsuit and would not comment on the individual charges.
According to a complaint filed by the New York Times, the unions focused on the number of people released in poor parts of the city to back up their claims of unfair treatment, saying that poor schools had lost more financial assistants because they had been drinking for a long time.
They point out that while schools in Staten Island and the Upper East Side have not been discharged at all, Brooklyn, District 23 in Brownsville, and Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx have lost 17 school assistants, and 46 assistants have been discharged.
He recalls that at Public School 36 in Harlem, five out of eight assistants lost their jobs, despite the fact that it is a school where 68 percent of students live in poverty. The lawsuit says: "It is not a neighborhood full of mobile parents who can get funding to make up for the budget deficit."
Public School 36’s budget was cut by 3.26% this year, and the school also lost money when the city changed the way of calculating bonus finances for every enrolled poor student.
The trade unions, among other things, claim that the directors of secondary schools may have been confused by the way in which the document approving the dismissal of the parent coordinators was written.
In the document, the word "excess" was used to describe the event, i.e. to cancel the position, although this word is much more often used to describe the transfer of a teacher from the school's payroll to a database of available workers whose salary is paid by the central authority.
“Sixty-six parental coordinators have been dismissed,” the complaint states, “and not just moved to the database for available staff.”
The mission is over, Congress is ready to adopt an agreement on the situation in Libya
Finally, Republicans and Democrats in Congress seem to agree on something about the uprising in Libya.
But before that happened, the revolution had to succeed, long-ruling dictator Muammar Gaddafi had to be captured and killed, and the participation of U.S. troops ended.
On Tuesday, the Senate Committee on International Relations will decide on a statement endorsed by President John Kerry (Mass.) along with Senators John McCain (Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.), in which it should congratulate the Libyans on their successful uprising and "American unity".
"With this statement, we want to appreciate the courage of the people of Libya who have begun rebuilding their country," Kerry said.
"Both sides of the political spectrum would like to express their support for their democratic efforts."
The sentences may seem innocent, but no debate on Libya has been easy so far.
Over the years, lawmakers on both sides have been constantly arguing with each other and with the White House over the text of a series of declarations to approve or, conversely, reject the United States’ military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. armed forces in Libya.
The proposal was rejected in the House because of the differing views of both political parties, so it was never even voted on in the Senate.
However, on the same day that this motion was rejected in the House, the Chamber also rejected measures that would stop the financing of US operations in Libya.
As a result, the U.S. mission in Libya literally found itself in a legislative purge – Congress criticized the way President Obama manages the mission, but his members were obviously not so irritated that they stopped supporting him in his actions.
The hesitation of Congress eventually preceded other events.
The rebels captured Tripoli in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31st.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
In its statement, the International Relations Commission "congratulates the people of Libya on their immense courage and admirable stamina in their efforts to liberate their people" and "praises the men and women of the armed forces of the United States and their allies who have engaged in a military operation to protect the defending and defending of the Libyan state."
The statement also "confirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new proposal receive the full support of the International Relations Commission, or will the legislators again be divided into two halves, as was the case with the June proposal?
The last version was opposed by Senator Richard G. Lugar (India), the main representative of the Republican Party in the committee.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday he had not yet seen the final version of the new proposal.
The House will vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution that would require a balanced budget, which should be a top legislative priority for almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, promoted by Bob Goodlatt (Va.), will be the first amendment to the Constitution on a budget or other subject to be voted on by the entire House or Senate.
For the time being, the other legislators, despite considerable efforts, have not yet managed to push their proposals through to the vote itself.
Goodlatt’s proposal is just one of 68 amendments to the constitution that were introduced in Congress and touched on a wide range of different topics.
Some of them were the same - the same proposal submitted to the House and the Senate - and others are only minor changes to others.
Only in the House can be found at least 15 versions of the Balanced Budget Supplement and another handful that would like to "regulate federal spending".
Some of the proposals are identical, but their proponents – especially novice Republicans who want to improve their reputation – can boast of their “authority.”
The revenue on budget regulation, which was approved in August, required both the House and the Senate to vote on the Balanced Budget Addendum.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding declaration to support the creation of such an addendum.
In addition to the budget, several members also want to discuss limits on the number of terms that members of Congress could serve, while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of terms that may be in office.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a range of supplements that would, among other things, guarantee the right to quality education and medical care.
The permanent proposal remains a supplement banning same-sex marriage and a supplement banning the burning of the state flag.
Some lawmakers also want to allow federal laws to be repealed if two-thirds of states oppose them.
Although members of Congress seem to be very active in proposing various additions, they do not significantly outperform the average in comparison with previous years.
In the 111th Congress they offered 77 additions, while in the 100th Congress there were 66.
Their activity even pales in comparison to the early 1990s, when, according to Senate Library statistics, members offered more than 150 additions every two years.
However, they were not much more successful than current politicians.
The last amendment that was added – the 27th Amendment – was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Crushed but not defeated," Gifford says in her first television interview since the shooting
Ten months after being injured by a gunman at a public meeting with voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Ariz.) appeared on national television on Monday night, singing along with the tune from the Broadway show "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow."
Giffords appeared on "20/20" on ABC News with Diane Sawyer, and it was clear she was still having trouble making sentences, and she needed help walking.
The whole show documented her difficult recovery, which was necessary because of a bullet wound that pierced her skull in front of her, penetrated her left half of the brain, and came out of her head behind her.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to the House to take part in the vote on the debt ceiling triumphantly.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, in which six people were killed and 13 others were injured, Giffords smiled, laughed, and sang – describing her recovery as “difficult.”
When Sawyer asked her how she was feeling, forty-four-year-old Giffords replied, “Very well.”
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of the hour-long special of the show "20/20", which aired on the eve of the release of the couple's new book, titled "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope".
The special has been tracking the entire recovery of Gifford since the January 8 shooting.
In the videos that Kelly shot during the first week, Giffords is seen in a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar across her forehead.
While her husband encourages her, she can’t do more than lift one or two fingers at the time.
A few months later, Giffords is caught sitting in a wheelchair and the therapists teach her how to perform simple activities.
Bend your head.
Blow your lips out.
And then, her first word: "What."
Within a few days, Giffords uttered another word - "toast" when she called for a change in her breakfast.
Videos broadcast by ABC show that music played a pivotal role in Gifford's recovery: The congresswoman sings them along with a melody therapist to the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Fallin" by Tom Petty.
During an interview with Gifford, who devotes two hours a day to therapy, Sawyer revealed that she does not remember anything from the day of the shooting.
Her husband said the Giffords read newspaper articles about the shooting until March 12, when she first asked him who the six who were killed in the incident were.
The shooting involves a suspect named Jared Lee Loughner, who is being held in a Missouri prison, where he is awaiting trial under the influence of forcibly administered drugs.
"A lot of people have died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Terrible, terrific, terrific."
Kelly Sawyer revealed that at one point during his recovery, his wife declared, “I lost.”
"So I said to her right away, 'Gabby, you didn't lose,'" Kelly said.
"You just got a snitch.
But you can do it, get together, and come back stronger than ever."
Military units meet with sympathy rather than respect.
The event was a gala night on Wall Street that brought in millions of dollars for war veterans in New York who don’t have a roof over their heads.
Kid Rock sang the ballad of helplessness, frustration, and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines ran around him.
The solemnly dressed crowd stood up and shrieked enthusiastically.
“Men and women serving in the military were considered heroes,” said David Saltzman, who organized the spring benefit.
On the evening of the ceremony, the then Chairman of the Committee of Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, was also present, but he saw the role of the military units somewhat differently.
"They were all presented as orphans," the officer wrote in the e-mail.
I’m sure the organizers thought so well.
I know you do.
But what I saw wasn't respect, it was regret.
So completely opposite impressions only illustrate the difficult relationship between the army and the often measured, sometimes glorifying American public.
The army is boundless with praise for its victims.
But these praises are worth something, the soldiers say.
The public is increasingly acting as if an individual in uniform is regretting it.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon leave Afghanistan.
“But the only way some people can support us seems to be to put us in the role of unfortunate souls.”
This topic is very sensitive to military commanders who do not want to look ungrateful or spoil their relations with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger that the units returning from Vietnam had to face was much worse.
As a result, most words of regret are uttered in silence and in private among war veterans.
When the two sons of retired colonel Mark Cancian returned from combat operations where they served as members of the Marine Corps, their father warned them that their service would be watched by people outside the army from two angles.
From the point of view of some, he will feel respect and wonder as he defeated the enemy insurgents and visited exotic places.
But others will be puzzled as to whether "a vicious, violent veteran is hiding beneath the surface," said Cancian, who took part in the fighting in Iraq and took a seat in Washington's government on his return.
He claimed that when he was looking for a job, some of the people who interviewed him were inconspicuously suggesting whether he could withstand the stress associated with working in Washington so soon after returning from combat.
“When you talk about your service, you have to count on negative reactions,” Cancian told his sons.
The military’s concern stems in part from America’s indifference to wars.
Success on the battlefield rarely gains recognition in a country that has little awareness of its own army and finds little self-benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“As a nation, we no longer value military heroism as it used to be during World War II,” Lt. Gen. David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan, said in a statement.
Instead, recognition by politicians and the public focuses primarily on the suffering of men in arms.
Soldiers are awarded for the number of actions they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
The military is facing increasing pressure to crack down on rape.
This week, it will be decided whether a trial of 28 women and men against the army will be initiated for alleged inaction in the case of rape.
If not, they are ready to file a lawsuit with hundreds of other plaintiffs.
The first-class soldier, Elizabeth Lyman, was allegedly raped by her military colleague at the age of 25 and was 11 weeks pregnant.
It happened in October 2008 and she was heading to the barracks at Miramar Air Force Base north of San Diego. After dinner with a friend, she ran into her male colleague carrying a box of 12 beers.
He asked if he could join her so that they could have a drink in her room.
"I had a warning light in my head," Lyman said.
But the native Texasan totally ignored her objections.
I thought, "No, he's 19.
"She's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts."
She claims that just a few minutes after they entered her room, a man walked over to her, threw her on the bed and raped her.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other existing or former members of the army will be waiting for a verdict hearing that could have a historic impact. This will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and will address whether to bring charges against his former defense minister, Donald, and former defense minister Robert Gates.
The indictment alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to fight the spread of rape in the military, which is contrary to the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The indictment was filed in February by Washington lawyer Susan Burke and the defendant party had 17 members at the time. However, over the following months, their number has grown to 28 - 25 women and three men, all of whom claim to have been raped or otherwise sexually assaulted by such females, as well as by their peers in the military.
Burke says she's going after the highest-ranking military commanders because the problem starts with them.
“The military is a directive system,” he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to prevent attempts to introduce measures against such acts? Supreme Command."
Burke also claims she has contacted at least 400 other survivors since February, many of whom could become part of other lawsuits filed in the future.
Her strategy: Rather than grouping all the accusations into this case — she puts all the eggs in one basket, as she says — she will sue in more different cases, if necessary, to keep the pressure off.
The Defense Department's defense team is led by U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride, who, along with his associates, filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents obtained by Newsweek detail the defense strategy – basically, current or former soldiers cannot sue the army for injuries they suffered as members of the armed forces.
According to a 1950 Supreme Court order called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the injuries suffered by soldiers in active service.
"The alleged injuries relate to the military service of the plaintiffs," the document said.
The Ministry of Defence has refused to comment on the matter.
But things have changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still not officially allowed to serve in combat, it is only a matter of vocabulary: in modern wars it is difficult to find a clearly defined front line.
In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers played an increasingly prominent role, especially in the area of communication with civilian women occurring in the war zone.
The result: 150 female soldiers fell between these wars - two-thirds of them directly in combat.
It is time for modernization in the military, Burke explains.
She's not alone in her fight, and besides her, three other lawyers are working on the case.
At Yale Law School, visitors to a veteran legal services seminar are preparing a lawsuit against four major military academies for allegedly developing an atmosphere that promotes hatred of women.
Independently of this, the non-profit organization of American Vietnamese Veterans Network is collecting documents for its lawsuit against the military. This lawsuit focuses on the diagnosis of a "personality disorder", which was allegedly detected in the victims of rape, according to the group of rapes, so that the army has a pretext for their activities - Anwa is a proponent of the people's
In December, her group filed a lawsuit against the state-run Veterans Association, which it blames for the discriminatory practices that were supposed to occur when processing requests for help from people who claimed to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate proposals were presented to Congress by a group of senators and parliamentarians from both political parties, proposing a range of remedial measures.
According to the Office for the Prevention and Treatment of Sexual Violence of the Ministry of Defense, 3,158 sexual assaults were reported in 2010.
However, this type of attack remains unreported in most cases, and according to the Pentagon’s own estimates, this number corresponds to about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred in a given year.
A report released in March also discusses the rate of criminal prosecution of suspects: In 2010, 20 percent of cases reported in the military were brought to court - half of them against the civil justice system.
Prosecutors in the case of Deputy Burke describe the attacks only as the first of a series of traumas.
First-class soldier Lyman, for example, reported the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it was supposed to happen.
During the night, she says, she was asked to repeat details of her rape to eleven different police officers, doctors and commanders.
She underwent all the examinations necessary to determine the rape, and in her bed was found the blood of the attacker - from the wound she had done to his arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman held a court hearing in which she was asked questions about whether she was in love with her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six persons were summoned to testify as witnesses of reputation in favor of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was pronounced," Lyman said.
"I felt like I was going to give birth right there, screaming out of the courtroom."
"They put me in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember I said to my commanding officer, 'That wasn't his judgment, it was mine.'"
The Lymans ordered a visit to a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with personality disorder, thus calling her incapable of service.
In January 2010, she was released from the army without honor and therefore without a claim to merit.
Whether the Lyman and other prosecutors’ case moves to the next stage or not, it’s a long-distance run, says John Turley, a professor of law at George Washington University.
However, he notes, "From my point of view, they should be able to move on to the next stages of negotiation."
Between them and the verdict, however, stands the aforementioned doctrine, which has been criticized from the first moment it saw the light of the world.
I am a lifelong critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The army is several decades behind, because their duties do not fail to adhere to the same level of motivational incentives and deterrents.
He adds, "Chances are hard on them... but it's important for them to try."
Change will only happen when good people are willing to fight.
If not decided in their favor at the hearing, Burkevo<0xC3><0xA1>, the lawyer of the plaintiffs, will gather hundreds of other persons ready to bring an action and start working on other cases related to this topic.
“We will not stop fighting with the military on this issue where there is no reform,” he said.
Or until we die, whichever comes first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Scientists Explore You on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, he was just another young man to present his anti-immigrant views online.
On Monday, Braivik, who confessed to the July murderous insanity that left 77 people dead in Norway, attended his first public court hearing.
Although Breivik could act alone, he was definitely not alone in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time at the computer while preparing the attack, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists supporting right-wing groups on social networking sites.
After the tragedy of this summer, scientists want to learn more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy - just go to Facebook.
“We realized that getting them isn’t really that hard,” says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recent report by a British research team on European digital populism.
The stock of personal information on Facebook is so extensive, Bartlett says, that it was enough for scientists to simply use the ads on the site and, thanks to it, determine with absolute accuracy the demographic group they were looking for - something that marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team across Europe found half a million fans of right-wing groups to be attracted to them, and they turned their attention to them and sent them advertisements. However, instead of inviting them through them to the newly formed group or offering them some diet products, they asked them to meet their needs.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from more than 10,000 fans of 14 different right-wing groups in 11 European countries – without ever having to leave the office.
“It’s a completely new way of doing research,” Bartlett notes.
Some of the results are not so surprising: online supporters of right-wing groups are all young men who are denounced by the increasing rate of immigration.
But on the other hand, “those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic, and less violent than those who remain constantly hidden behind a computer screen.”
The work of the DEMOS team is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, health scientists and political researchers use this site to study everything from health issues to social trends hidden by state updates, posts on the walls and pressing "Like" buttons.
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users. On average, each of them will provide three different data per day, making this social network literally a "information supernova", which is behind the development of many new research. The number of academic papers, in which the word Facebook appears in front of their name, has increased by 800%.
For some scientists, the magic of Facebook is that it gives them the opportunity to study people without having to bother them somewhere on the street.
"It used to be that when you wanted to do a poll among people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
“You’d have to get to a place where you’d never be let go,” Bartlett says.
“Facebook is breaking this down – you’re just going straight to them.”
Others claim that the site can offer a way to identify a social-health problem and avoid them.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Morena of the University of Wisconsin, a research team found that university students who analyzed their drinking outcomes on Facebook were much more at risk of alcoholism than students who were silent on the topic.
Morena suggests that students’ peers monitor the site and come up with an offer to help a student who posts too many drunken statuses.
"The problem can't be solved unless you can diagnose it," said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Dr. Morena and director of the Center for Children's Health, Behavior and Development at the Seattle Children's Research Institute.
“We’ve found a way to identify endangered children that we wouldn’t otherwise have a chance to discover.”
Facebook is constantly polling the data of its users.
The information team of the site has compiled statistics on the relationship between the status of the relationship and Valentine's Day, electoral participation in 2010 and the satisfaction rate of the nation (mainly using the information that they had access to - Internet freedom advocates have long claimed that the site should make its informational treasure available for research).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them whether they like it or not – in exchange for the opportunity to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site needs to provide their personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of research they don’t even know about?
Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to collect data offline, but online data is accessible to everyone.
“I don’t think most of the users thought scientists could look at their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, of a 2006 study he conducted using his students’ public Facebook walls.
"As far as they were concerned, they took it to be information only between them and their friends."
There is also the question of methodology.
Even when researching offline, there is no guarantee that the subject is completely honest.
It is not possible to verify on Facebook how much of the information on the profile and posts on the wall are true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn explains.
That’s why Selwin, who has spent many years researching new technologies, believes that a pencil and a notebook remain the best possible tool to be used in research.
“When you go out into the real world and talk to real people, it’s something that can’t be replaced,” he says.
“Social research should be about society and social activities – and a hell of a lot of social activities are still happening offline.”
"Cold and Inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik attends his first public court reprimand
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who confessed to plotting two attacks in which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself as a fighter for "resistance" during his first public court hearing in Oslo.
"I am the military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and among the Norwegian Knights Templar," he told the court, where 500 people gathered.
“I object to the court because you have been mandated by organizations that support the ideology of hatred and because they support multiculturalism.”
"I confess to my actions, but I do not admit any guilt for them."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "didn't want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a stage from which he could make his views known."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who had brought a prepared speech with him, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from contact with the media for four days, and announced that the authorities would have full control over all his visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
The hearing was attended by about 30 relatives of the victims and survivors.
Some came in the hope of being able to look Breivik in the eye, others to make sure he was held firmly under lock.
All of them took part in order to move the case to early closure.
"I thought he looked cold and inhumane," one of the survivors of the attack told a NRK commentator.
"It wasn't pleasant, but I can say for myself that after seeing and hearing the suspect, I moved a little further mentally."
Breivik, dressed in a dark suit and a blue tie, remained calm and professional throughout the hearing. On arrival and departure to the building without any difficulty in view of the journalists present and the survivors in the eyes.
Despite Breivik's bizarre notion that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge admitted that he was not crazy, noting that there was no evidence that he had any accomplice.
It may be comforting to some that the June 22 attacks appear to be the work of a single extremist and not a group of radicals.
However, this does not automatically reduce the sorrow and confusion that are still in the minds and hearts of the entire nation.
"I wish she'd look like a beast, but she's not," said a relative of one of the victims.
"If it were, it would be a lot easier."
7 Lessons from a Lost Interview with Steve Jobs in a Movie Heading to the Movies This Week
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, the opinions of people began to emerge who compared him to Henry Ford - and chose him for his genius as the Greatest Modern Inventor.
At the recently rediscovered interview with Jobs, which was aired for a special movie that is heading to the cinemas this week, it will be for all Apple fans the fact that his creative mind has perfectly understood the business processes and workflows behind his products.
He was an amazing designer, dreamer and self-proclaimed member of the hippie movement, but at the same time also a pedantic organizer and a person who fine-tunes every little thing to the smallest detail - he believed that many entrepreneurs suffer from the "imagination that a really great idea is an excellent product of 90 percent of their work... [but] still among the excellent ones.
In 1995, Bob Cringely worked on the TV show Triumph of Computer Fools, which dealt with the dawn of personal computers. During the filming, a unique, more than hourly interview took place.
It had been ten years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and had been busy working with his new computer company NeXT, and eagerly watched as the general public embraced the internet.
In the end, only a short portion of Cringely's entire interview was used on the TV show, and the original copies of the interview were rumored to have been lost during transport.
Shortly after Jobs’ death, however, VHS copies were found in the director’s garage.
It is this material, slightly trimmed, that forms the basis of the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which is heading to selected cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who has become famous for his reluctance to provide longer interviews, here Jobs seems surprisingly excited to be able to talk about his technological philosophy and business strategies.
He also appears to be a very thoughtful person.
Four times during the interview, there will be a longer pause between the question and the answer - 10 to 15 seconds of thinking, when it is possible to see how Jobs perfectly thinks the answer to be as accurate and as accurate as possible.
There are also moments when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to the surface, when he acts impatiently at Cringely’s questions and encourages him to get to more important problems and topics faster.
The interview was filmed before the era of Pixar, iPod, or iPhone, and there are scary prophetic thoughts in it as Jobs evaluates what other companies are doing right and wrong while offering his own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.
It’s one thing to read Job’s posthumous assessments of his career, but on Jobs, whom we see here as a keen dreamer in the bloom of his genius, there’s something raw and inspiring.
Here he has his own vision of what things could and should look like.
It didn’t take long, and after he had spoken his thoughts, he began to put them into practice as well.
A quick summary of seven scenes from the Lost Interview, which is definitely worth noting:
How he learned to run a business:
“Over the years of business, I’ve always asked, ‘Why are you doing this?’ and the answer was always the same: ‘Well, that’s just how it’s done.’
No one knows why he does what he does, he never thinks deeply about things related to business.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues by describing his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
He was completely confused by the way the costs were recorded - they often started with the inscription "standard costs", about their amount he could only imagine. At that moment he decided to go his own way - he developed an automatic tool that guaranteed that they could determine the business costs in a moment.
How he performed the Rosary on the Pope:
Jobs recalls the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively hack into a phone company and call for free anywhere in the world.
A lot has been written about the device in the past, but Jobs’ enthusiasm, when he describes the Blue Box as an instrument of power, is literally contagious.
It tells how Wozniak and his devices were tested using a paid phone and switched from one AT&T network to another while using as many satellites as possible.
“At least half a dozen times we went around the world like this, so when we yelled something into a pay phone, it sounded a minute later from the other phone at the door,” Jobs laughs.
“We were young, and we found that we can build something that is capable of managing infrastructure for billions of dollars around the world.”
The two of us made a little thing that could control a much bigger giant - it was an incredible experience and I don't think Apple would ever have been created without it.
In the middle of the night, through the Blue Box, they called the Vatican and asked if they could talk to the pope, pretending to be Henry Kissinger as best they could.
Gradually, higher and higher rank members of the Catholic Church were summoned to speak to the American diplomat in the middle of the night, and only just before they woke up the pope to the phone, the pair of them unraveled and laid down their headset.
How he fell in love with technology (and phoned Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12, he was looking for spare parts to build a barometer, and he found a number on Bill Hewlett's phone book and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute interview, Jobs had secured a summer brigade at Hewlett-Packard.
"It was the only company I knew at the time, and it shaped my view of what such a company is and how it should treat its employees."
Jobs later became one of HP’s employees who visited the company’s research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw “the first desktop computer ever made.”
It was as big as a suitcase, it had a CRT monitor and I immediately fell in love with it.
As a teenager, I progressed higher and higher in HP, slithered around that computer and started writing programs for it.
How Innovation Invents:
In several places, Jobs talks during the interview about how he invents new products while running.
In the early days of his career, when he set out to sell a couple of circuit boards, a customer asked him to assemble a whole computer for him.
He had only 30 paid days, during which he had to invent, assemble and deliver the finished equipment.
When he was later at Apple, he recalls the problems they faced when developing a computer mouse:
"I remember how we were fighting pretty wildly ... yelling at me that it would take five years [to put a mouse that would cost $300] to stop having fun, I went out and found a designer."
Ninety days later, we were able to produce a perfectly reliable mouse for $15.
How big companies take their breath away:
Long before he led Apple’s revival, Jobs foresaw that many industry leaders would roll back and lose their market share in their vision.
“Let’s say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make better copiers or printers, well, what next?”
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company can no longer be more successful.
Right now, sales and marketing are in control, so companies are run by people who are in charge of just that, while people who are in charge of their own products are kicked out of the decision-making process.
The technological genius that has led the company to its unshakable position is now replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products - skill and technical knowledge are essential.
This is exactly what happened at Xerox.
Xerox could have owned literally the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times bigger than it was, it could have been Microsoft in the 1990s...
Instead of winning, they won a loss.
How to take innovation as an art form:
“Between an excellent idea and an excellent product is a long journey and a lot of work... and as that great idea evolves, it changes and grows.”
During that time, you will learn a lot about him.
You have to make a number of compromises - certain things just electrons, glass, robots or factories do not make.
You need to keep 5,000 things in mind all the time - different concepts - and put them together...
In the end, it depends on the taste - you try to think about the best things that humanity has ever created, and in a way you try to project them into what you do yourself.
Picasso said that good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I've never been ashamed of stealing the best ideas.
Macintosh was so amazing and successful because the people who worked at it were excellent musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, and coincidentally, the best computer experts in the world.
Without computers and new technologies, they could do amazing things in completely different industries.
Scalia and Thomas had dinner with opponents of the Health Care Act at a time when their case was being handled by the court.
On the day that the Supreme Court sat behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial issue of whether to accept an objection to President Obama's health care bill, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, will attend a corporate-sponsored dinner.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the proposals submitted.
One of the cases discussed was a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging the radical overhaul of healthcare that Congress passed last year — a law that mobilized conservative activists around the world.
The judges agreed to hear the lawsuit, but a 5.5-hour hearing is expected in March, the result of which will further expand the presidential elections, which are scheduled for 2012 and will be in full swing at the time of the decision.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and try to get the bill rejected will most likely be Paul Clement, who served as the U.S. Attorney General under George W. Bush.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society Group, which has been advocating conservative legal principles for many years.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the law-challenging trade associations, the so-called National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which huge funds are at stake in the process.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel hours after a court discussion on the case.
It was attended, among others, by Mitch McConnell, the top representative of the Republicans in the Senate and a confirmed opponent of the Health Care Act.
And quoting guests? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: these two judges with the actions of the Federalist Society have been participating for years.
And it is certainly not a matter of anything that would be contrary to the rules of ethics.
In fact, these judges are exempt from the obligation to observe the principles of conduct to which lower federal judges are subject.
However, if this were not the case, their conduct would definitely fall under the C4 principle, which states that "the judge may participate in events that are being organized by related and other organizations in order to obtain funds, but the judge must not be a speaker, an honest guest, nor should he be included in the program of the event."
However, Scalia’s and Thomas’ relationship with the two law firms involved in the case, as well as the companies with huge financial interest in the case, was rich enough to alarm activists calling for ethics in the government.
"This shocking violation of ethics and indifference to the code of conduct is contrary to the claims of several judges that the Supreme Court conducts itself according to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of the Common Cause.
“The judges drank and dine on social benefits along with lawyers waiting for their case to be heard in court.”
Their presence and assistance in obtaining funds through this action undermines all claims of inattentiveness, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little understanding of their critics and have told them that they also easily combine their judicial responsibilities with the actions of groups such as the Federalist Society.
Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a high-ranking conservative activist.
Conservatives argue that judge Elena Kagan, rather than Scalia and Thomas, have an ethical problem.
Kagan worked as Attorney General under President Obama when the first objections to the law appeared in court.
Kagan's critics are pushing her to renounce her involvement in the case, claiming that she fought for the law as much as she could be uninterested now.
Kagan had no indication that she was going to resign.
Boeing wins record-breaking contract for $18 billion in jet aircraft
Emirates has ordered 50 two-way jet airliners with the option to purchase 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Aman Air, for which it collects more than $1 billion.
When a company gets an order for 50 pieces of their products, it’s usually no reason to celebrate.
But if that company is Boeing Co., and the price of those 50 planes totals a record $18 billion, that’s something else.
Equally important news is where Boeing got the order: The Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
According to a forecast released on Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion over the next 20 years.
Boeing has announced its largest order in history for the dollar value of commercial jets — 50 dual-aisle Boeing 777s — over the weekend.
A sensational order came from Emirates airlines based in Dubai.
At the 2011 Dubai Air Show, Boeing announced that the airlines would be able to purchase an additional 20 aircraft, bringing the total value of the order to $26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing announced that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, sometimes referred to as the Dreamliner, which boasts significantly better fuel consumption and passenger facilities.
The total cost of these six aircraft exceeds $1 billion.
“This is excellent news for the entire Boeing company,” said Neal Dihora, an analyst at Morningstar.
"The quality of these particular customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East belong to the oil-producing nations there.
This means that not only do they have the money to pay for the planes, but the rise in the price of fuel - mostly damaging to airlines because it is one of their biggest costs - is not so decisive, because the country itself earns on higher oil prices.
This is important because they are not as likely as other airlines to cancel or postpone aircraft orders due to higher fuel prices, Dihora says.
"They have such natural protection," he says.
The order from Emirates strengthens Boeing’s leading position in the wide-body aircraft market and brings Airbus SAS into the tight spot to try to disrupt Boeing’s dominance with its A350 transport model.
Boeing’s victory comes four months after Airbus officials announced that the first flight of their largest A350 aircraft, which is a direct competitor to the 777-300ER, would be delayed.
The displacement occurred because customers demanded a greater payload of the aircraft and the arrival, so the manufacturer took the time to supply the machine with more engine power.
The share price of Boeing Co rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican President's Sister Reportedly Defeated in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n Elections
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponent, Faust Vallejo of the PRI, was helped in the pursuit of the governor's chair by drug dealers.
Sister Felipe Calderon appears to have lost the governorship of Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n in violent state elections, and said on Monday that one of her opponents had been helped by drug dealers to win.
Preliminary results were attributed by the leadership of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, to Fausto Vallej in the Western state's elections.
"The involvement of members of organized crime in the entire electoral process, and especially until yesterday's election itself, is alarming not only for Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n, but for our entire country," Calderon said in an interview with radio the day after Sunday's elections.
"They threatened our candidates, members of a public opinion polling group... they kept the ballot box, they built roadblocks... and they let people vote on behalf of the PRI.
The PRI Party ruled Mexico for seven decades until 2000, when it lost its presidency.
However, he plans an early return to power and the victory in the elections in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n is an important step in this effort.
The PRI party hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have beaten Calderon, who led the election the day before, only very tightly.
Calderon, a candidate for her brother's conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureolis, a candidate for the left-wing Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which has so far dominated the government, was placed third, a very unfortunate loss for the dissident and unfortunately persecuted party ahead of the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to accept the preliminary results as valid.
Vallejo, the former mayor of the state's capital, Morelia, rejects any relationship with drug dealers and encourages other candidates to acknowledge the results.
Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n has long been controlled by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is the birthplace of President Calderon and it was in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n in December 2006 that he began his military fight against drug traffickers.
However, the violence persisted.
The mayor of PAN, a proponent of Luisa Marie Calderon, was assassinated just a week before the election and many candidates from the election resigned out of fear.
However, whatever the outcome of the Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n elections looks like for the PRI party anyway, the party’s victory will help gain a new impetus.
The expected representative of the PRI party in the presidential election, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Wahington Vallej and said, "I think this victory could be very encouraging given the coming year."
ADB Bank Calls on Asia to Help Save the Eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has called on India and China to be prepared to help save the Eurozone from its severe debt crisis, otherwise there could be an overall downturn in the world economy that would also have a negative impact on the growth of economies in Asia.
Rajat Nag, ADB’s Manila-based chief executive, said the two fastest-growing economies in the world must “do everything in their power” to help the currency bloc recover rapidly through the International Monetary Fund, or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the Bric states [Brazil, Russia, India, China] are watching all of Europe’s troubles “too undisturbed” and said that Asian financial aid combined with European leadership and resources would help ignite the long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in it together."
"So anyone who could help Europe out of the crisis is a good fit," he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
“Asia may be protected to some extent, but it’s definitely not immune.”
"So if China and India can help, they should definitely do it."
The European Monetary Association has been hard-pressed by a serious debt crisis for several months now.
In recent days, Italy’s borrowing costs have risen dangerously and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The growing debt crisis in Europe has raised fears that it could drag the global economy back into recession, and calls have begun to emerge for the newly booming leading economies to come together and help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that all Asian aid would be channelled through the IMF, but noted that bilateral aid - such as the purchase of bonds from the European Union Financial Assistance Fund, the European Financial Stability Facility - would provide greater negotiating opportunities for Asian partners of European countries.
Anand Sharma, India’s trade minister, said that “India will do what it can” to help the eurozone as its own economy is now suffering from a decline in exports and a drying up of foreign capital influx.
"Nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and uneasy," he said.
“We are facing a difficult task and we need to maintain a high growth rate.”
“It’s not an alternative, it’s a naked fact, because otherwise we could find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women.”
Others argue that emerging economies such as India have nothing to do with helping European economies when they are forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to explain aid for Europe to India’s 1.2 billion people, when 800 million of them live on $2 or less a day.
"One day they might find out that the Greeks are retired at 50 and enjoying their holidays on the beaches, which would be difficult for them to explain," he said.
Lee Howell, Director-General of the World Economic Forum, similarly questioned why Indian stocks should be used to maintain well-paid jobs for many Greek citizens in poorly managed and loss-making sectors, such as rail transport.
Mr Nag stressed that the Eurozone crisis is at risk of a "dangerous domino effect".
The bank’s forecast of 7.5% economic growth in Asia between 2011 and 2012 is now facing a “risk of decline” due to the European threat.
He stated that vulnerable emerging markets must create “unpredictable spending plans” to be protected from the decline and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Pentagon Warns of Possible Defense Cuts
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Defense Secretary Leon Panetta tightened his grip in Congress on Monday when he warned that burgeoning automatic budget cuts could jeopardize national security and spark a financial chain reaction beginning in the Pentagon and continuing across Afghanistan’s battlefields to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon will already have to spend $450 billion on budget cuts over the next ten years, but now it fears a further $600 billion if Congress fails to reach a spending deal.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating to the entire resort," Panetta wrote in a letter to Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that the inability of Congress to reach a budget agreement and the resulting so-called containment would cause a 23% flat-rate decline and the halting of many new projects.
"Due to such a huge reduction, used in this reckless way, it will not be possible to carry out most of our construction or ship projects - you cannot buy just three-quarters of buildings or ships. In addition, there could be serious damage to further modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to senators.
"We will also be forced to separate many of our civilian employees, and as the reduction is due to take place so quickly, we will also almost certainly have to send civilians on forced leave in order to be able to meet the target requirements."
"These changes can shake the faith of those who care for our army and seriously damage its readiness."
In the end, the cuts will also affect combat units, Panetta announced.
"Although the accounts for financing possible overseas war operations will not be directly affected by this standstill, operations there will be adversely affected by major changes in other budgets," Panetta warned.
"There will also be cuts in contract staff, which will result in delays in the contracts agreed to support the war effort of our people."
"Statuses of paid employees will be reduced, resulting in late payments to suppliers and consequent violations of legal and political support."
Both senators resigned from Panett ten days ago and asked him for details on the possible impact of automatic cuts on the defense ministry.
"The consequences of a standstill at the Department of Defense could cause a rapid degradation of the view of the United States as a world military power."
"We are strictly against this tough measure," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they published Panett's letter.
"It's not a conclusion we can live with, and we definitely don't want to sign under it."
"The planned cuts are a threat to the national security of the United States, which we should not allow."
“We will see if Panett’s letter and recent warnings will increase pressure on Congress to approve the budget and amplify the voices calling for the Pentagon to be excluded from the list of cut areas.
Panetta has recently been increasingly open in talks about possible cuts, despite moving to his high position in the Pentagon himself with many years of experience approving budgets in Congress and the White House, so he knew he was getting into a tough fight.
At a press conference held a week ago, the defense minister suggested a brief picture of what his resort can expect - an army shell, inside which, however, the nucleus will be missing.
"It'll be like a ship without sailors."
"It'll be like a brigade without munitions."
"It'll be like an air force without trained pilots."
"It will be like a paper tiger, like an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to complete the mission," Panetta said at the start of a Pentagon speech.
"It will be like a unit without morality, unprepared and incapable of coping with a possible enemy."
"As a result, he will welcome the aggression..."
The appendix to the letter to McCain and Graham Panett specifies how the reduction will result in "significant operational risks: late responses to crises, conflicts and disasters; significant restrictions on planting and deployment opportunities around the world; anticipated unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
Panetta added that some of the biggest defense projects could be expected to be completed, including those already tested, and those that are only in the early stages of planning.
The list included, for example, a project of the F35 aircraft, a planned new bomber, a new generation of ballistic submarines, a new coastal battleship and a new ground combat vehicle, which the army and marines wanted to replace the humvee.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 would save $80 billion over the next decade, but its proponents say it is a necessary next step in improving the military, which is needed to deal with possible threats from China and other rivals.
How to Recognize a Lie
A fleeting look at recent newspaper headlines shows how serious and ubiquitous lies and deceptions are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has been busy accusing several women of being sexually harassed — both sides claim the other is lying.
Managers at Penn State University were accused of false testimony as they tried to hide records of a retired football coach sexually assaulting a boy.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught, with a microphone running, telling U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
The lie has been able to destroy entire careers and block the stability of many countries.
New York congressman and internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself when he published information that was immediately disproved by indisputable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of misusing his campaign finances to try to cover up his unmarried relationship.
And no one will ever forget the media circus that took place around Bill Clinton when he lied during his second term in office about his sexual intercourse with Monica Lewinska.
It's just a lot of stories about cheating in school and university.
There are instances when teachers themselves give their students test answers just to make them look good in their assessments.
Mentors, who should teach the opposite, send a message that lying and cheating is acceptable.
How many frauds do we face?
Studies show that in a single day you lied somewhere between 10 and 200 cases.
Suppose that many of them are merciful lies.
Another study found that strangers lied three times during the first ten minutes of their first encounter in life.
Determining lies, or “recognition of lies,” is a necessary skill that everyone should learn, whether for personal or professional reasons.
However, it is not a social game that would be similar, say, to Charad, when one shouts, "I have you." Recognition of deception is a serious branch of science working with scientific data collected over the last six decades in the fields of philosophy and in the field of research in the field of psychology, and in the field of research in the field of psychology in the field of psychology in the field of psychology in the field of psychology.
One of the results of the research is that most of the old myths about lies have been refuted.
The liars look you in the eye.
It's not like they're squeaking, squeezing, blushing, or sewing.
But do not be deceived by the fact that it is difficult for a liar to perceive and reveal.
A trained lie identifier can reveal the truth from a sentence construct, small facial expressions, the way questions are created and their timing.
I have spent several years gathering scientific knowledge from a vast and developing industry related to the recognition of lies, and it is clear that the detection of deception is a modern skill that can be easily learned and in today's complex world can be very helpful to you - especially if you are leading people on your work responsibilities.
Good liars can read well in others, let them be soothed in vigilance, direct their emotions and intuitively realize how the other side accepts them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men spread more “self-centered” lies, while women tell more lies “focused on others”—mostly to protect someone’s feelings—that married people lie less often to their partners than free people “who do, however, lie” to others.
We also know that if you are perceived as a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know someone is lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of the subject.
This is called “initial observation.”
Thanks to him, he will have a later finding to compare with.
Notice the body posture of the subject, his laughter, work with the voice.
You should know if someone is routinely beating their feet so that you do not unjustifiably accuse them of lying just because they start beating their feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then try to determine the clusters of false verbal and non-verbal behavior.
But take it only as a warning, not as a sign of a lie.
People who tell a lie may stop moving the upper half of the body when trying to remember their fictional story, may turn the tips of the shoes to the door, lean towards the exit, significantly change the posture of the body, or give the appearance of "relief after the end of the conversation" - exaggerated by aloofness.
People conducting interviews often give a false signal that the interview is over, just to see what the relief will look like after it ends.
Also understand the subject’s language.
The famous story of how Scott Peterson once renounced and used the past when he claimed that his murdered wife was alive, sparking a nationwide search for her body.
Deceiving individuals can also express themselves disproportionately: "I had no sexual relationship with that lady... Miss Lewinska" or they repeat the difficult question whole.
The most common verbal characters are only very minor.
Someone can use a lot of "mitigating language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell you the truth... from what I know... according to my best knowledge."
In such a response, we do not know too much of the facts and often it is another warning signal.
There is no magic to uncover any lie, but it is possible to master the skills by which lies can be uncovered.
With these skills, a person will have a greater chance of not encountering a liar and a fraud in his personal and work life.
The controversial plan for the construction of the oil pipeline will be redirected after the threat of postponement of approval by the U.S. government
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to postpone approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico — which has pitted the unions against each other, but reassured environmentalists — a company that is moving pipelines to take care of the matter has announced that it is willing to reroute to the project.
TransCanada announced on Monday evening that it will move the planned pipeline route from the environmentally sensitive Sandhills area in Nebraska, and is confident that the project will still be approved.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the government headquarters in Nebraska.
TransCanada columnist Alex Pourbax claims that the company is convinced that eventually the construction of the pipeline will be approved, even though it will lead a different route.
The announcement came after the foreign ministry announced last week that it is deferring a decision on the federal approval of the project, from where it will not conduct studies of possible alternative routes that would allow it to avoid interfering with the Sandhills area in Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast underground reservoir.
"This is really a move forward," Rep. Lee Terry of Nebraska told Fox News.
A new environmental assessment commissioned by the foreign ministry would probably postpone any decision until 2013, a year after next year’s elections, but authorities deny that it would play any role in the decision.
In a written statement last week, Obama described the decision as a foreign ministry request and expressed his support.
The 1,700-mile pipeline will connect Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
From the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas, it flows 700,000 barrels of oil a day.
Six states will have to cross this route.
This project is absolutely hated by environmentalists, but loved by working crews, who estimate that 20,000 new jobs will be created while working on the pipeline.
Legislators in Nebraska, however, opposed the plan and considered enforcing laws that would force the company not to interfere with the Sand Hills region and the water-bearing layer of Ogallala, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
An existing study on the environmental impact commissioned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found that the project will have only a minor negative environmental impact, but a source from the energy industry said the inspector general from the Ministry ordered a new review of the entire process of the original study, focusing mainly on two questions.
Once upon a time, a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was Hillary Clinton’s adviser in 2008, did not represent a conflict of interest in the program.
Next, whether the company that was hired for the original study was not chosen improperly because it had ties to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of throwing up her baby.
The New York family claims that singer Patti LaBelle furiously broke into the vestibule of their Manhattan house and frightened their daughter by throwing her up in fear.
The outburst of the hit "Lady Marmalade" scared eighteen-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of strangers," her family said in a lawsuit filed before the Manhattan Supreme Court.
On November 10 last year, stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were going on a family trip.
When Kevin Monk landed the car, Roseanna Monk gathered the luggage down to the lobby of their house at Riverside Boulevard and carried Genevieve with her.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped at the door for a moment and put the baby down for a moment.
"Someone showed up behind my back and said, 'You know what your daughter is doing?' I said 'yes' and left to pick her up."
LaBelle rebuked the pregnant woman in an irritated way.
"She said to me in an aggressive tone, 'You shouldn't put your daughter at the door,'" Roseanna Monk said.
"I told her, 'I don't care what you think.'"
She got angry and began to speak sloppyly - screaming out loud the simplest expressions...
She had a bottle of water with her, and she started squeezing water out of me.
He claims Genevieve had a hysterical seizure.
“I said to the woman, ‘Look what you did to my daughter,’” the child’s mother said.
LaBelle threw herself at her mother - who still had Genevieve in her arms - and had to stop her until her escort dragged her into the waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
The girl screamed so loudly that she vomited, she added.
Later, the family sent a letter apologizing to LaBelle, but received no response.
LaBelle's lawyer and spokesperson are not responding to our phone calls to comment on the whole case.
The lawsuit calls for more unspecified compensation, but the family's attorney, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family plans to dedicate all the raised money to a charity dedicated to children with cancer.
"The purpose is to force Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her actions," Davis said.
"Such behavior is completely unacceptable, especially if it is directed against a school teacher holding an eighteen-month-old child in her arms."
Climate change has slowed the economy
During the first year of the government of Maria L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez, unemployment and unreliability increased in Sinaloa, foreign investment decreased and with them the economy
The year 2011 will be inscribed in the economic history of Sinaloa. This is the first year of the government of Maria L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez, which calls itself the government of change. This government brought with it great expectations in terms of economic progress, however, not even the economy has deteriorated due to unfavorable climatic conditions.
Low February temperatures have caused millions of losses in agriculture, reduced the growth potential of the state economy, and are aware of a decrease in economic activity of 3.6% in the first half of this year. In the field of agriculture there was a historical decline of 31.16%, which disrupted the dynamics of the sector and other sectors.
According to the report on the damage caused by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, the damage was recorded on 582,835 hectares of cultivated land, of which 78.03% was completely destroyed and partial damage was found on the remaining 21.07%.
The decline in economic activity up to November did not cause a steady increase in unemployment rate in the state. The growth rate of unemployment in the state increased in the first three quarters, and the growth rate of unemployment in the state increased in the first three quarters. From January to March, the growth rate of unemployment in the state accounted for 55,053 inhabitants in the state of Sinaloa, respectively.
Less liquidity
According to Gerard L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, it is possible to explain the increase in unemployment indirectly, based on the steps that have been taken at the level of public policy.
"We are witnessing rising unemployment, which is associated with various factors. Among them, among others, the loss of liquidity in the market due to resource constraints as a result of legislation approved by Congress in connection with the fight against the laundering of dirty money. They have not tried to invest in people who are illegitimately illegitimate
Stopping Migration
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes said that the increase in unemployment is also due to the demographic factor.
"The number of people who go to work abroad, to the United States, has decreased, both because of the difficult entry and also because even if these people get over the border, it is difficult for them to get a job. So people stay and demand a job from our state, and so unemployment increases,"
Unreliability
The analysis of the labor market in Sinaloa is also deteriorating due to the growing unreliability that prevails in the field of working conditions. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Democracy, 60.38% of the employed population in the state works without disbursing benefits from the social security administration.
Other labour market features, such as low wages, are added to unemployment and unreliability. In this administrative area, the lowest wages are from all over the country, according to the registries of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Planning.
The average monthly income of workers in the state of Sinaloa was 5,352 pesos as of September, well below the national average, which ranges to 7,375 pesos.
Reduction of foreign direct investment (FDI)
Along with the decline in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, in 2011 there was also the most significant decline in foreign direct investment in the last 10 years. According to the Ministry of Finance, in the period from January to June, foreign direct investment amounted to $ 630,697, before the same period, which represents a decrease of 5 per cent to $ 77%.
On the other hand, the Ministry for Economic Development of the State Government reports investments of 17 280 million pesetas per year. These investments were mainly aimed at service companies.
Debt (disambiguation)
In the context of the economic downturn scenario, the government of this state asked the state congress in July to approve a loan in the amount of 3 billion pesos. This would be intended for investments in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas in order to revive the economy. The local congress did not approve a loan for a total of 2,600 million pesos.
Reactions
According to representatives of the business sector, the first year of the government of Maria L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdés pointed to the lack of management skills of the government.
Miguel Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, president of the National Chamber of Transformational Industry, said that in 2011 there was a lack of coordination of the will of individual sectors, including the government of the state itself.
"The development of the economy in Sinaloa was really small during this year. We have to work intensively to regain the land that we lost this year. In 2012, we have to double our efforts, there will be a lot of harmonization of the efforts of all of us and, in particular, the correct and synchronized functioning of this new government.
Slowness of the economy
Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez said that events such as the freezes at the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and limited its development and growth.
"Weak economic movement has been caused by a number of events, including freezing. One of the main consequences was the slowdown in the economy, which did not recover quickly enough to restore dynamism, which would allow us to achieve acceptable levels of movement of processes, products and services.
Re-defining the mission
According to Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Employers’ Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, it is necessary to push the state to more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we are observing that work is underway. We believe that it is necessary to prepare a long-term plan in which the goals and economic direction of the state would be redefined, because it is important to mobilize all the potential of material and human resources that Sinaloa has," he said.
The work that is ahead of us
President Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision of the future that would better guide the government's efforts.
"In general, I would say that the government has been trying to achieve good results in various areas, there has been some progress in the area of economic development, but it is important to create a long-term plan," he said.
He said that the current administration has shown progress in terms of public policy leadership.
"There are elements that make it possible to say that the government is trying to be friendly. I can say that there is work done here and I think that the government is aware that there is also a lot of work ahead of us," he said.
Sentenced for 8 kg of marijuana
Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in prison for possession of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Attorney General of the Republic informed that the convicted dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval. He was convicted of a health-threatening crime, namely the possession of marijuana for business purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was apprehended by Mexican army personnel on June 7, 2010, while marching in Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite station 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The dealer was driving in a white pick-up truck. In the car in the shelf had a black bag and on the passenger seat a small backpack. The soldiers found 8 kilograms of 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the secured man remained available to the Judges of the Second Division and the proceedings remain internal within the Centre for the Implementation of the Legal Effects of Crimes.
Debts for contributions to projects
Social projects, which are part of programs such as Habitat, Saving Public Places and 3x1 for migrants, face the danger that they will not be reached to the end or that they will have great delays due to the lack of economic resources, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Miranda said.
The director of urban social development said that if construction work has progressed so far, there is now a risk that the state government will not be able to secure appropriate supplies that require funds of more than 11 million pesos for three programs.
He said that the total investment in these three programs is almost 50 million pesos. The state accounts for 25%. Until this time, the funds for work have been provided only by the Federation and the city, therefore it is possible that there will be a delay in the implementation of the projects.
"They have to secure almost 12 million and even though the year is already coming to an end, we have not received anything at all. And this despite the fact that already in July we should have received a share," he said. "In order not to waste time, we started projects and continue very successfully, but we are lacking money."
He said that last year, under the administration of Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Aguilar Padilla, the state did not pay the relevant supplies, and therefore, at the beginning of the new period, the city had to apply for a loan to be able to repay more than 7 million that the state administration did not give them.
"The same thing happened to us in the previous six-year period, because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs went on. To get to the mentioned programs this year, we had to get funds to cover what it did not finish," he explained.
Although there is a promise by the state officials regarding the transfer of these resources, he stated that a request was sent to Armand Villarreal, the Secretary for Administration and Finance, to speed up the process and the corresponding percentages arrived as soon as possible.
"They were supposed to give us 12 million and although the year is coming to an end, we have not yet received a peso."
Court approves 'end of analogue broadcasting' in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analog signals with digital ones is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme State Court (SCJN) rejected the constitutional complaint filed by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential decree, which wants to speed up the so-called "off of analogue signals" and implement it in 2015 instead of 2021.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the court, Juan Silva Meza, believed that President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n did not go beyond his powers when he issued a decree that outlined the individual steps leading to the transition to terrestrial digital television.
With this result, the action brought by the Senate was rejected, because the qualified majority of eight votes necessary for the court to be able to express itself on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the said decree, which thus remains valid.
The draft judgment prepared by Minister Olga S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero presents the possibility to declare the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of all issues related to radio and television is a matter that is reserved by law to the Federal Commission for Telecommunications (Cofetel). Thus, there is a violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination.
Only Zald<0xC3><0xAD>var, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies supported the constitutional dispute in an attempt to fight against the decree. Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero accepted the demands and suspended the implementation of the decree and all the actions described in it, leading to the transition to digitization.
The Ministerial Meeting also decided to reject the complaint lodged by the Chamber of Deputies without entering into a debate on the proposal, which is also under the responsibility of Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister stated that he did not agree with the arguments of the proposal in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure measures through general standards to prepare the public administration.
"I don't think even if she did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulator," and he recalled that public policy planning in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector belongs to the federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
Replacing analog signals with digital ones is one of the biggest changes the world has experienced in recent years. It is associated with better use of radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
He believes that deferring change would mean deferring the benefits of digitalisation, which requires a decision on a matter of public interest, because digitalisation does not only have a technical dimension, but "it also touches on economic, social, political and national security issues".
As he emphasized, these issues "require the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of the economic direction of the state. It includes a whole range of competences that the Constitution entrusts to the government of the state".
He recalled that a number of countries around the world have already completed the transition to the digital system and have done so through their governments, despite having at their disposal highly specialized technical authorities.
He stated that it is not possible for the government to introduce into the administrative sphere the observance of laws prepared by the legislative power by issuing a dissenting decree, which to some extent interferes with the powers of Congress.
In Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n they analyze the possibility of adding "voice by voice"
According to data published by the PREP, the difference between the first and second place in the elections of the governor is less than 27 percent. So far, the votes of 879 out of 6074 constituencies have not been counted.
The possibility of counting "vote-by-vote" appeared in this year's elections in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n, where, according to data published by the Preliminary Election Results Program (PREP), the difference between the first and second place in the governor's elections is less than 27 percent, and it has not yet counted the votes of 60 votes.
In this context, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n (IEM), Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral authority approved a number of measures that should harmonize local standards with federal electoral reform.
As will be recalled, Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n had not officially confirmed his political constitution nor his state electoral code or the law on electoral justice. The state congress approved reforms shortly before the expiration of the legal deadline for their entry into force in this constituency, and the governor of the state was appointed by the legislature.
On November 9, the Supreme State Court (SCJN) resolved a constitutional dispute initiated by the local legislature and declared the vote of the head of state on constitutional reforms "invalid and illegal" because he has no right to "neither approve nor veto" them.
Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal replied that the approval of the relevant measures by the General Council of the IEM would make it possible for the partial and total census to be carried out by the local electoral authority.
In this way, the partial counting of votes, one or more electoral packages, will be possible under the following conditions: the election results do not agree; there is no record of the counting of votes and the calculation in the relevant field or it is not available to the President concerned; or if there have been errors and obvious errors.
In addition, the total counting of votes in all polling stations will be possible if there is evidence that the difference between the potential winner of the election and the candidate in the second place is less than or equal to one percentage point; whenever at the beginning of the meeting there is an explicit request of the representative of the party, and/or
The total recounting of votes will also be possible if, after proper counting, it is found that the difference between the likely winner and the candidate in second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, and also whenever there is an explicit request of the political party whose candidate was elected in the second place.
It should be noted that in such a situation, there are elections in Morelia, where according to the PREP, the difference between the first and second place is less than 0.16%, although 129 of the total 923 electoral districts have not yet been counted.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered in the mountains of Inflammation, the family confirmed.
The remains of pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés were transported on Sunday night to Saltillo, his hometown. During Monday, a solemn ceremony and a mass will take place.
According to the family, the lieutenant-colonel's last wish was that his ashes be scattered in the mountains of Inflammation.
After receiving the highest honors along with the other people who died in the accident, the Bacio Cortés family returned to the capital city of Coahuila aboard a Mexican Air Force plane. The family and closest friends attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At noon the ashes of the lieutenant colonel arrived at the chapel located in the Nazario Ortiz Garza class, where family and friends also came.
At 5:30 p.m., a farewell ceremony was held at the Saltillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school tech classmates and members of the American football team, of which Felipe Bacio was also a member during his graduation preparations.
"He wanted to go back to Saltillo and his wish was for his ashes to be scattered in the mountains of Zapalinamé. That's how he always said it to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
According to her, the lieutenant colonel fulfilled all his wishes, was at the top of his life, "he was a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, a son, a loving brother living for his family".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young and entered the Colegio del Aire aviation school in Zapopan, Jalisco.
Some didn’t believe it because they said he even drove a truck, but he always went after his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto D<0xC3><0xA1>vila Bacio remembers him as a very good man, "just came to Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him, like when he brought Martha Sahag<0xC3><0xBA>n to Saltillo".
The young man even remembers that when he was seven years old, he went to Zapopan for the promotion of his uncle, which is why he is convinced that he died in what he liked most in his life: flying an airplane.
They said their last goodbye.
With Felipe Bacio Cortés, Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force in 1985, we said goodbye to all the honors that had come to him from the governor Jorge Torres L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, the citizens and the government of the state, the Mexican army through the sixth military zone, the student body itself, the Mexican air force and the chief of staff.
Bacio Cortés died in the past few days after a helicopter crashed that he was driving, along with the secretary of government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six other people, all officials of that state.
At 18:05, the remains of the Salto native Bacio Cortés (assembled) arrived to be handed over to the Mexican Air Force through a funeral service led by Major Jaime Martinez to the space where the family, his daughter Amanda and wife Cristina, their mother, siblings and other relatives had gathered.
Three abandoned dead bodies found on Cadereyta farm NL
A few hours before the discovery, military officials presented to the media 11 people who were detained in the area for crimes related to organized crime.
The bodies of three men killed by gunfire in different parts of their bodies and heads were found on an abandoned farm in Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo Le<0xC3><0xB3>n.
The discovery occurred on the 1.5-kilometre road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the level of an area known as El Castillo.
People who moved in these places noticed that the cottage with a beige-coffee fence had an open door from time to time.
When they looked inside, from a distance of about three meters, they noticed the corpse of three people, so they immediately alerted the competent authorities.
One of the people wore a yellow sports shirt and dark cotton pants and was not wearing a shoe. Next to him, the person was also lying in a sports T-shirt with white stripes.
A few meters further, the body of another person dressed in a red sports shirt and blue cotton pants was found.
All three were lying face down on the ground.
According to data obtained at the sites, all three people were likely murdered at another location because no bullets were found.
On the fence of the hut were found messages addressed by one group of organized crime the other and also a number of traces of bullets, both on the building and on the door.
11 Suspects Arrested in Cadereyt
The Secretary of National Defense presented 11 people, including young people, who were members of a criminal group that operated mainly in the Cadereyta area and which is associated with kidnapping, murder, persecution and illegal burial.
According to the information published in the first attempt on November 11 in the colony of Los Alveros, 8 people were detained and managed to free one detained person.
Three properties and a cell phone were secured and confirmed to be members of a criminal group called Los Zetas.
The next raid took place on November 12 at 6:00 a.m. Military personnel were on a tour of the Rancho Viejo area in Cadereyta when they spotted cars without SPZ and two people in it.
After stopping the car, they conducted a search and found one rifle, cartridges and 18 rounds.
Then, on the basis of these statements, one of the accomplices in the area of La Frauda was arrested on 13 November at about 2 p.m., and when he saw the soldiers, he tried to escape.
They were accused of illegal burials in the municipalities of General Teran, China and Cadereyta.
A new Italian government will be appointed on Wednesday.
Appointed Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the Italian president tomorrow to introduce him to a new government that will face the crisis that keeps this country above the abyss of economic disaster.
Appointed Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the Italian president tomorrow to introduce him to a new government that will face the crisis that is keeping this country above the abyss of economic disaster and that has put the entire euro area at risk.
The presidential palace issued a report announcing that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet with President Giorgi Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can form a government.
It is expected to present a government composed mostly of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new government will take power.
Monti said he would present to the president the results of his talks with political parties in an effort to form a government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," he told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say he would be able to form a government, but the tone of his comments suggested that obstacles were being overcome.
"The frame is now well marked," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, that is, in a much shorter time than usual. Meanwhile, Italy is trying to fight the political and financial crisis, which has caused the amount of debt to climb to an unsustainable level.
The new administration, led by former European Commissioner Montim, must approve the tough austerity package required by European leaders, the only way to restore Italy's broken credibility.
Due to the volatility of the markets, interest rates on Italian BTP bonds with a 10-year maturity of 7 percent exceeded the level at which Greece and Ireland had to apply for bailouts.
Emma Marcegaglia, chairwoman of Italian employer organisation Confindustria, told reporters after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would very much support this government."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this fiery situation.
Monti’s hopes for success have increased significantly thanks to the support of PDL Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign on Saturday by the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined for good results," Angelina Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party, told reporters.
The support of the PDL, Italy’s largest party, is significant, as up to this point a number of its members have opposed the government with a technocratic majority that Monti constitutes.
Support to Parliament
The new Monti government needs strong support from parliament in order to push for unpopular austerity reforms.
Any hindrance or delay in a given effort could trigger a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has joined the pressure and warns that Monti's failure could be a disaster.
On Monday, Monti began talks with political parties, trade unions and business groups, youth and women’s organisations.
The round of negotiations will end on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed by President Napolitano on Sunday, which enabled a very rapid response to the crisis.
After a brief decline at the end of last week, when it was already clear that Berlusconi would resign, interest on Italian bonds has returned to the critical limit, thus responding to uncertainty as to whether the new prime minister will succeed.
Saving Italy, which has a public debt of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.8 trillion, would be beyond the scope of the eurozone’s current financial reserves.
Monti said his government should hold on to power until the next election, which is scheduled for 2013, despite general forecasts that he says politicians will only give him time to carry out reforms, and then announce early elections.
Monti said he would like to incorporate politics into his cabinet, but major parties insist that this government must be made up only of experts to bring Italy out of the troubles that the country has gotten into because of financial pressure.
Political sources said that bilateral distrust and disagreement between the parties complicate an attempt to integrate both the government and the political personality.
Spaniards take part in international matches more often than Costa Ricans
Out of 22 Spanish footballers, ten cross the border of 50 international matches.
On the side of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 called players reached the number of 50 matches.
A huge contrast on the side of Costa Rica, if we compare the 22 players of the two countries who met today at a friendly match at 15:05 at the National Stadium in San José.
While the world and European champions, FIFA’s number one monthly rating, have a wide range of A-class inter-selection matches on their account, Costa Rica only has a defender, Michael Uman, who alone has played 50 international matches.
This number was reached last Friday in a match against Panama (0-2) at the Rommel Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez Stadium.
Spanish footballers, who play in the Star Games and in the powerful clubs of the English First League, maintain intense activity in league championships and domestic cups and high-level matches within European Cups such as the Champions League for over a year.
To the previous one, we must also add the experience of the Spanish national team in the complicated knockout matches for the European and World Championships.
Costa Rican players, on the other hand, have very limited opportunities for foreign matches in the area. There is, for example, Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the largest number of foreign matches from the Spanish national team has on his account goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who last Saturday before England (loss 0-1 in London) reached the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play against Costa Rica today and win a new record for Spain - 127 international matches.
Xavi Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, the key player of Barcelona, has 106 matches on his account.
Casillas and Xavi were even officially announced last week by UEFA along with other Spanish players who have a hundred matches on their account, among them the already mentioned Zubizarreta with 126 and midfielder Schalke, Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, with 102.
Carles Puyol also got close to 100 matches.
They are followed by Xabi Alonso with 91; Fernando Torres with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta with 62; Cesc F<0xC3><0xA1>bregas with 61; and David Silva with 53.
On the side of Costa Rica and close to Michael Uman moves left wing Junior Diaz with 48 games and goalkeeper Bryan Ruiz with 45.
In addition, only 5 overtook the limit of 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez with 36 and José Luis L<0xC3><0xB3>pez with 35.
The least number of matches.
With fewer than 30 matches in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Albiol (31).
On the national side with less than 30 games stands Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest did not exceed 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bol<0xC3><0xAD>var has only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first game.
Spain's top scorer is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the Costa Rican side, Bryan Ruiz has the most hits, nine, two more than Carlos Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet included the country in its tour on the occasion of the celebration of 20 years of existence
"The journey to Costa Rica is a dream that becomes a reality"
In an exclusive interview for Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band is ready to offer one of the best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
We have been waiting for more than 20 years, but the group itself assures them that the opportunity to play in Costa Rica is a dream come true.
This is what bassist and founding member Jeff Ament said, who spoke exclusively with Viva last week from Brazil.
The group is on the South American continent as part of a tour to celebrate 20 years of existence and will be at a unique stop in Central America on Sunday 20th.
This day will take place at 19:30 at the National Stadium together with the angel group The X and the national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is a sample of an interview, the full transcript of which can be found on the La Naci<0xC3><0xB3>n website.
For your Costa Rican fans, this is a dream come true. Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you realize what your fans are experiencing?
The trip to Costa Rica is also our dream, which becomes a reality.
In South and Central America we are barely a second time and the experience so far has been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once, on vacation. It's a beautiful country and I believe we'll be able to stay here for a few days.
So we are very happy to bring you our music.
I ask, because they literally love the group here, the fans are experiencing these days of preparation very intensely.
What do you say to your biggest fans?
Thank you for staying with us for so many years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we're sorry that it took us so long.
Some people already talk about the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does it put more pressure on you?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve performed in the last 21 years have been created over the course of a few weeks.
We have performed some great shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that this will get us into shape for a concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to this concert.
We love this country, we like to serve, we like the jungle. For both activities, Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its waves suitable for surfing?
We have a lot of surfer friends and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo. The waves here are incredible.
My friends go surfing in Costa Rica or Nicaragua or Mexico. These are the best places to surf. And so we learned about Costa Rica through people who love surfing.
If we look at your tour, you have prepared a huge show with many songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played here, we have no restrictions on what we can't do.
We will try to show the best show with a variety of songs. We will try to play a few songs from each album and present our fans with a good and diverse repertoire.
You will never repeat the repertoire.
- Why?
I think it’s partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it’s hard to choose what songs we’re going to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven’t played in a long time, we focus on them and we are also surprised because we will remember why we liked them so much and that we may have already forgotten about it.
So the show is more interesting for us, which is why I think it is more interesting for people too.
This tour celebrates 20 years of art.
When you look back, is it hard to believe everything you’ve done?
Yes, I'm sure you are.
First of all, I don't think any of us could have imagined that we'd be in one big rock band and that we'd be in it for more than 20 years.
We are aware of how much we have been given and we are impressed that we can continue to play together.
We love each other and we love making music.
We are lucky to be able to look at the places we have always longed for.
We couldn't have gotten better.
What did it mean to you that you were an important part of the creation of the grunge genre?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this group, in which the greats themselves are represented.
People from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
It’s surprising that when a movement arises from a group of friends, it doesn’t happen very often.
From time to time, a group is formed in the city, but it is much less common for five to ten groups to emerge from one city at a time.
We are proud of this and we are honored to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we play with others.
Last year we were at the festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour. We are lucky that they are all our friends and we are honored that we can be part of this movement that originated in Seattle.
It is also very unusual for a group like yours to stay together and still have the same members after all these years.
Yes, the four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is a much longer time than the usual duration of the group.
I think that firstly, we are all lucky to be still in this world, and secondly, the fact that we are always interested in each other plays a role.
We are all close friends and thanks to this we have managed to open up musical paths that allow everyone enough freedom to experiment for themselves.
We trust each other, we value each other’s music, and I don’t think it could be any better.
Your relationship with the word fame has not been easy. However, thanks to your success you can do what you like.
How do you find balance?
As we grew up, it became increasingly easier to find balance.
We try not to drive too much on tour because it is very easy to fall into this trap of crowds and people who love our music.
When you realize that people came for music, you will remember that you have to respect the music and what you gave it. You must not be carried away by being famous, rock stars. None of us ever really cared about this.
What do you think of Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote great songs, and at the beginning it was something spectacular.
We’ve been together for three years and never released an album until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
It was very frustrating because it took so long. The most important thing is that we are still friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us today. When I listen to a song or look at the photos, I remember how happy Andy was.
She was an incredible person and we miss her so much.
The national band Las Robertas will be commissioned to start the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that that's why you chose them as the forerunners?
Yes, the production sent us videos with a few suggestions and we liked this group the most. Therefore, we are curious about what Las Robertas will offer live and they must be very entertaining.
Why do you always change the words Yellow Ledbetter live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he adds the first thing he thinks.
Who is influencing you as a bass player?
Lots of people.
I'm the first to be attacked by Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all night about the basics that I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge even though it is no longer in fashion?
I think we've always felt a little separated from the word grunge.
When it comes to grunge, I imagine bands I mentioned like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that were created at the same time. And if music like this is still valid today, it's something great, because it's music worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are better than today.
In the beginning, your music was slightly gloomy in character and now it is more positive.
What is behind this change?
This is interesting because I feel like there are a few songs in the new album that are lighter to cut, but there are also songs like The End or Juste Breathe that are considered very gloomy, although they may sound positive.
For both of you, when Ed played them to me, I cried, and they're songs of deep darkness.
I think that when you grow up and have some trauma in your life, you lose someone from your family or a friend, these things start to affect your art and music, and these two songs represent that to me.
I also think you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori re-hospitalized for medical tests
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital on Tuesday, where he will be tested for muscle loss in his lower limbs, his attending physician said.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed by his government (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including tongue cancer, for which he has been operated on four times and is currently under the control of doctors.
Deputy Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal doctor, told Canal N television that Fujimori would undergo tests at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases in three days, where they should find out why he is in pain and why he is losing strength in the lower limbs.
Aguinaga said he believed Fujimori could be pardoned for humanitarian reasons, but the former president himself does not want pardon because he feels innocent.
He was operated on four times for tongue cancer, lost 18 kilograms and added other ailments such as severe erosive gastritis, cyst on the pancreas, kidney stones, high pressure and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor said.
Fujimori has been serving his sentence since September 2007 at the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the deaths of 25 people killed by a murderous squadron of troops operating illegally in the early years of his government.
A fly on a visit to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation led by Uruguayan President José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and businessmen, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday, aiming at expanding trade between the two nations and touching on the political issues of the region.
Mujica will meet his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, on Wednesday. This is the most important meeting of an extensive visit full of meetings with politicians, trade and representatives of the Uruguayan community living in Mexico. The program was published by the Uruguayan presidential office.
The meeting of the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will serve to exchange information on political issues between the two countries," the Uruguayan presidential office said in a statement on its website.
According to local media, Mujica will try to get Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n to support Uruguay in the dispute with France, which occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on the list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened that countries that will continue to remain in the position of tax havens would be expelled from the international community. This statement provoked a negative opinion from Uruguay and consultations with the ambassador in this European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November. The G20 is a group of the most powerful developing and developed countries in the world. Since January this year, it has concluded an agreement with the Latin American country on the exchange of information to prevent double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has sought to concretize fiscal exchange agreements in order to get out of the "black list" of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), to which there are countries that have not implemented all the required international standards of cooperation in the field of taxation.
From a commercial point of view, Mexico and Uruguay have concluded a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) since 2004, which has strengthened the exchange of goods between the two countries.
The beardless plumber runs in 3D thanks to "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been fighting tirelessly for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the villain Bowser, but has never appeared in 3D: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the girl with stereoscopic technology.
The title, which is coming to all stores around the world this month, has been created from the start to take advantage of all the features offered by the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play three-dimensional games without having to wear glasses.
"Mario is a character who has to tell how stereoscopy without glasses should work," Omar <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, a Spanish Nintendo press officer, said during a video game presentation in Madrid.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game created specifically for this carrier" because hitherto successful images such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" have been adaptations of already existing titles.
A Nintendo spokesperson said that in addition to the image being 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "available" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and smooth game.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple", whose task is to attract less skilful users.
Once you have overcome this level, you can enter the "second round" at the levels of the game that are more challenging this time.
In addition, users can choose real-time between "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, it will be necessary to play in 3D to overcome various challenges and "do not depend on optical deception".
This new release of Super Maria in 3D also presupposes the return of the character to the portable console, which has not happened since 2005.
In this video game, Nintendo plays a note to those who watch the saga and repeats the successful formula from previous parts. It is that the plumber of the bearded man will have to go through dangerous mined platforms to free Princess Peach.
Although the player finds news in movements, in the vicinity, in disguises and also among enemies, the "playing" Luigi also appears.
Colom approves release of Portilla to the United States
President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he has stepped up steps to extradite former President Alfonso Portillo, who is to be held accountable in the United States for a conspiracy to launder $70 million.
This is the end of a process aimed at getting Guatemala to respond to a request by a northern country that demands Portillo’s extradition so that it can stand trial.
At a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was in line with the independence of the judiciary and the executive branch and that he had been informed that the criminal court had already ordered his extradition.
He assured that during his term of office he did not "interfere" with court decisions and allowed all editions that came to his table.
In addition to Portilla, Sergio Ruano Marroqu<0xC3><0xAD>n will be extradited for murder and serious harm to health and Edgar Estrada Morales and V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's move means a step of execution after all judicial and constitutional instances have been exhausted to prosecute the former president, who ruled from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be extradited once his legal situation in Guatemala is resolved and human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was found not guilty of embezzlement of $120 million at the Department of Defense during his presidency. This process preceded the release, but the Public Prosecutor's Office appealed, bringing the case back into play.
Triniove Helped 6,000 Young People in Danger
The organization was created to help uneducated children not to find themselves on the edge of society.
The balance sheet of the first 25 years of Trinijova's existence is very important: 6,000 young people who were threatened with social exclusion have been helped. The organization has been helping them overcome difficult situations for 25 years.
To this must be added the long hundred jobs that have been acquired for this social group.
Yesterday’s anniversary also served to present the balance sheet as part of a festive event that took place in the former production facilities of the Fabra i Coats factory and which was attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijova was founded in 1986 in the Trinitat Vella district in order to help young people with low education, no work, drug addiction or a situation where they could fall into social exclusion.
Yesterday's meeting in Sant Andreu was attended by a large number of representatives of organizations and institutions that have cooperated with the association in the past 25 years.
The diverse political representation, at the time of the elections, showed the uniform character of the work carried out by Trinijova.
Together with the President of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the event was attended by former socialist education adviser, Ernest Maragall, and former deputy mayor and current eco-socialist councillor Ricard Goma.
Fabra i Coats, the current Social Welfare and Family Advisor, Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Cleries, and Jaume Lanaspa, the Director General of Social Work in La Caixa, also arrived at the grand hall.
Mas said that Triniove was born at a very difficult time and that today also presents a number of obstacles, but added that the work that the association has brought to this day "is a good foundation".
The president cited Triniove as an example of how it is possible to fight against adverse circumstances and how to give courage to people in difficult situations.
“The crisis is nothing new for this organization and for the work it does,” he said.
There was a relocation of the captured house, in which were held gigantic parties
Invaders took possession of 11 of the 13 apartments in the building in Balmes, 51
12 occupants left the house yesterday at noon without resisting
All of this suggests that the nightmare experienced by the neighbors of the number 51 in Balmes Street is finally over.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building they were illegally inhabiting at noon yesterday, where they organized gigantic parties that woke up the neighbors. They left the building from a court order without having to interfere with the police.
After the operation, the lock on the door was replaced to prevent a recurrence of the situation.
"From now on, the entrance will be guarded," said the administrator.
The occupants, who took 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest are inhabited - took away all the electrical and partly even water equipment, in addition to painting the walls and leaving behind all sorts of waste, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
In the first three apartments, huge parties were held that lasted up to two days and woke up the other tenants.
Next to the building is a disco, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that while the building was occupied, revenues fell by 80%.
The owner of the disco emphasizes that the occupants of the building made her unfair competition, because they sold drinks for 3 euros, while the disco costs 10.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment business had to respond to the complaints of the neighbors because of the noise. But the problems were not caused by the visitors of the disco, but by the inhabitants of the captured house and especially those who participated in the parties held here, the frequency and intensity of which in recent weeks has increased, according to the locals.
The owner of the discotheque explained that the problems were so great that they even agreed with the owner of the building and has been forgiving her rent for nine months.
The city police also confirmed that in recent weeks they have received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The chairman of the People's Party (PP) in the town hall, Alberto Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez D<0xC3><0xAD>az, last week called for "the building to be moved immediately, ending the problems of civic coexistence suffered by the neighbors and the destruction of the area."
The President of the People’s Republic explained that only one floor had been removed before the summer, but in recent months, the occupiers have entered all floors of the building and almost all apartments, and in one of them there have even been thefts.
In this regard, he added, "it is necessary to end impunity and be consistent when it comes to acts against civil liability that took place in the building."
City police also cleared the building in Nou Barris yesterday.
At 3:30 p.m., police reached the building on 35 Mont-ral Street after being summoned by neighbors who saw four people enter the building.
All four were immediately apprehended.
Park or Mountain?
The architects met on the occasion of the proclamation, which brings with it more than a controversy about fees
The city’s 16-gate competition is once again opening a debate on the role of Collserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the time of the greatest flowering of the already extinct Corporaci<0xC3><0xB3>n Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this self-government printed several pamphlets in support of the Collserola Park.
The flyer defined the mountain as a large park of the metropolitan Barcelona.
What’s more, it was supplemented by a numerical comparison with New York’s Central Park.
After the extinction of the CMB in 1987, the park returned to the minds of many as the upper limit of Barcelona. The Catalan metropolis is one of the few that is not oriented to the north - south axis, but up (mountain) - down (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park goes in this direction.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with savages instead of the Yogi Bear.
That was the position until September, when the city hall announced a mega competition consisting of 16 competitions for the same number of entrance gates to Collserola.
The gate, of course, rather records the idea of the park.
Either this or someone is trying to put the gate on the field.
There is only one question: Collserola, a park or a mountain.
During the competition, both from a purely organizational point of view and based on reflection on the city, this question becomes the central theme of all Barcelona architects.
It’s already a topic as glaring as when two members of this old caste chosen to meet in an elevator shake hands.
And it was this act that sparked one of the rare coincidences between what the three Barcelona architects think and the prominent university professors.
Miguel Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the selection procedure is justified.
According to Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n, after the question of the Gulf side began, "it is necessary" to discuss the "mountain side" as well, so Ildefons Cerd's speech on green apples was not brought to an end.
"We have to start from the principle that the most extensive Barcelona park is the beach.
Among other things, its great availability.
Collserola is more complex," said the architect, for whom the name "gates to Collserola" bears "lexicological trap": we must not imagine them "as entrances to the park, but rather as the definition of zones where it is possible to act".
Modol, as well as Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n and Bayona with experience from the world of urbanism, classify the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" posing "some dangers".
The danger arising from the "uncertainty that the public space project presents today" after the experience of the 1980s, which had in the Forum area "its own swan singing".
The first concern is the very definition of the boundaries where it should be built.
“To define something is to take the next step,” that is, to move one step further.
"It is necessary to keep in mind the new urban and planning tools, because the current ones (with reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)) can cause a real disaster."
If we focus in more detail on the question, Modol believes that the Collserola valley slope can be "considered a park", but the Barcelona part is not, for purely topographical reasons.
Modol also recalled that there is already work done by the Patronat de Collserola, which "must not end up in the trash", although he welcomes the fact that the town hall offers his grammar to intervene in the project from "the first moment".
And moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain and the city is a kind of break that allows architects to get involved in the debate, but he "doubts" that it should be precisely this technical profile that will lead multidisciplinary teams ("it's all about skills", he adds) that need to be created: "Architects should only be tools."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gave the title to this game is complex, because the global vision of Collserol is missing in the tender documents: "16 tenders were announced that dealt with all the axis of the mountain - the sea, but there is no longitudinal study that would address it as a field".
This means that at least he has applied to all 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the project of a single gate can affect the concept and definition of the architect of the neighboring gate.
According to him, the City Council should guarantee that the zone located directly above the Ronda de Dalt should provide for the entire length of the zone of equipment that would ensure a smooth transition between the city and the greenery.
Casino has pardoned Jon<0xC3><0xA1>si Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal, who will be released
After 72 days in prison, Cadino Red, a law enforcement official, granted a pardon to Monterrey's brother in a trial in which he was prosecuted for alleged blackmail.
Manuel Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal has spent 72 days in prison and will now be released after being pardoned by the legal officer at Casino Red before the Second Criminal Court in that district, which was discussing a case of blackmail in which Monterrey’s brother was charged.
After the attack on Casino Royale, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s was to request the payment of an economic quota for the Monterrey City Hall to allow an illegal operation in a betting house.
After a public indictment, the State Prosecutor’s Office began a criminal prosecution of the brother of the panist mayor. On September 2, he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
After 4 hours spent in front of the Public Prosecutor’s Agent No. 3 for property offences, he was transferred to Prison 1, located in Barrio Antiguo in the state capital.
He remained in this place for the next 49 days after the second arrest warrant was issued and the Public Prosecutor's agent denied the possibility of complicity or organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Cadereyta Criminal Court on suspicion of blackmailing Casina Red's owners in the amount of one and a half million pesos. However, he remained only a few hours in prison with moderate supervision because he was threatened with death.
The leaders allowed him to remain in the city jails in San Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s de los Garza during the trial.
On 25 October, he was presented with an arrest warrant issued by the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Y<0xC3><0xA1>nez, who stated that, after almost two months of investigation, sufficient evidence had been gathered to prove Jonas's guilt.
On Monday, Casina Red's legal representative, Victor Aldo Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pecin and asked for mercy for the region's mayor's brother, on the basis of which he will soon be able to return to freedom.
During a legal hearing with the representative of the Public Ministry assigned to this court, Ramiro Arias, asked Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez if the damages had been repaired and which of the associates decided to grant a pardon.
On the basis of the official file 197/2011, a legal pardon is granted to Jonas Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal. In the process that was conducted against him, it will not be possible to file any complaint. It is also not possible to claim compensation for damages or punishment.
The court ordered the immediate release of Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal Bret<0xC3><0xB3>n at around 15:50.
The secretary of the court, Jorge Yanéz, arrived at the prison in the city of San Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s de los Garza to inform Jonas that he had been granted an official pardon and his case was put in the archive.
He also informed him that the judge had issued an immediate order for his release.
Secretary Dionisio Perez J<0xC3><0xA1>come unveiled details about the plane crash that killed the governor’s secretary, Francisco Blake, and seven others.
The Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of an investigation into the accident that killed Secretary of State Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people show that the helicopter crashed directly onto the ground with full force, without the pilot having a chance to attempt a forced landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come, Secretary for Communications and Transport, said that before the plane's launch, the pilot stated that the climatic conditions allow flights.
"The parts that appear suggest that the unit has come into contact with the terrain several times, the wings have become entangled in branches of trees 25 meters from the place where the unit lost its hull."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 people and therefore met all the requirements for the transfer of personnel.
In addition, on the basis of an investigation carried out in the area of impact, no components were found on the ground.
"In the search, it was found that parts of the aircraft were not located elsewhere, so the aircraft hit the mainland as a whole.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 people, it met all the requirements for the transport of people.
The terrain shows a slope with an inclination of seven to thirty degrees.
The secretary assured that at the moment the most important thing is to get the results as soon as possible. However, the investigation can take several months or up to a year.
Gilberto L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said that at the time of the crash, the Presidential General Staff helicopter was traveling at travel speed and the accident occurred on soft ascending terrain.
"This information supports the hypothesis that at the time of the accident it was a normal overflight operation," he said.
At a press conference, SCT representative Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come listed six key points of the investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with aviation standards, the flight was carried out according to the rules of visual flight, that is, the crew must see the field during the flight.
Meteorological conditions:
Reports in the AICM indicate adequate conditions at take-off, accordingly the aircraft is proceeding towards the border, between the DF and the State of Mexico were visible layers of clouds at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to the clouds, the crew was looking for a lower area and greater visibility all the way to the Cuernavaca valley.
Location of impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last record of the helicopter from the radar coincide, it is likely that before the impact there was no loss of control or disruption of the flight path.
Dispersion of aeroplane residues in a restricted area:
The information we currently have at our disposal allows us to assume that the impact occurred on a straight trajectory and from the side.
The outline of the dispersion of the aircraft's debris indicates that the helicopter was integral at the time of the impact on the mainland.
No fire or explosion was recorded.
There was no evidence at the scene of the accident to indicate that there was an explosion or a fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that there may have been several contacts with the mainland.
During field work, the remains of the aircraft were found at an altitude of up to 9,200 feet above sea level, the terrain slopes, the height of the incline goes from seven to 30 degrees.
Photographs show footage of a possible break-up along the route mentioned above.
The information provides elements that appear to suggest that the helicopter may have come into contact with the ground in several locations.
After a thorough search in the vicinity of the accident, in an area larger than the designated area, no remains of the helicopter were found, which reinforces the suspicion that the impact occurred in a state when the helicopter was still intact.
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance has started research on the gene that causes obesity
The Institute of Health Insurance conducts research in order to discover the gene responsible for obesity in children and adolescents. The research is carried out with the support of experts from the IPN Institute
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it is conducting research to detect the gene causing obesity in children and adolescents. The research called "Genetics of Obesity in Children and Adolescents" will allow to obtain results related to overweight.
In a report by Miguel Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry at the National Health Center’s Specialized Hospital of the 21st Century, he explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been set up.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and from the Center for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
People can come to the IMSS sports centers in Valle de México, where they will be testing young people every 8 hours from 8:00 a.m. onwards.
He emphasized that the research began at the Cuauhtémoc Sports Center (Mexico State) and from October 8 this activity is also carried out at the Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yolt Sports Center (East of Mexico State).
Once data from 500 to 600 children are obtained, the study will continue at the Independencia Sports Center (south of the Federal District) and finally at the Morelos Sports Center (north of the Federal Center).
He explained that the aim of this research is to determine the components and importance of genetics in terms of the development of obesity, and to trace risk factors on Mexican children and young people, thus preventing the development of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of International Diabetes Day, which is celebrated on 14 November, he recalled that the goal is to collect data from 3,000 children and young people between the ages of six and 14 years, with the consent and under the supervision of parents, for the application of specific questionnaires on nutrition.
The questionnaire will also ask about physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that could cause diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He specified that every Saturday with all participants, anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure is measured, levels of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin are determined and genes are examined (they try to identify genes that are involved in the formation).
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez said the research reflects health care professionals' concern about the alarming increase in children's weight.
"Health surveys conducted between 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years, only boys had a 77% increase in obesity and girls had a 47% increase in obesity, and there was also a dramatic increase in overweight," the IMSS expert said.
He said that one of the reasons for looking for indicators is the assumption that the population of the country differs from other populations by its genetic history.
He informed that the average Mexican has 65% Indian-American genetic equipment, 30% European and 5% African. This fact is reflected in the genes that are responsible for the development of diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity is commonly explained as the inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) and which is stored in the form of fats.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit of the participants is that they get an overall assessment of the condition of the children, which will determine whether they show any known overweight or obesity.
He said that even the presence of dark-colored wrinkles (acantosis) on the neck and forearm indicates the likelihood that the individual will suffer from metabolic problems and pre-diabetic conditions.
The information is so far confidential, doctors pass it on in writing to parents and explain to them all the measurements and lifestyle changes they need to make in order for their children to avoid the disease.
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity, and other chronic diseases: a sedentary lifestyle signifying a lack of daily physical activity, day-to-day sitting in front of television, and the use of vehicles instead of walking for short distances.
Overweight also causes a large calorie intake, that is, a greater consumption of sweetened drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins, and the genetic load that is the subject of this research.
Asphalt from UNAM will not be cleared
Rafael Herrera, a scientist from the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry, creates modified asphalts with polymers, thus creating a mixture with better functionality, regardless of climatic conditions and temperature
If the paving had been properly taken care of, it would not have been necessary to repair nearly 200,000 excavations after each rainy season in the Valle de México Metropolitan Area, said Rafael Herrera N<0xC3><0xA1>jera, a scientist from the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at UNAM, who added that from the construction and maintenance of the asphalt to the construction and maintenance of the asphalt.
In his lecture The Technological Cause of Excavations, which he delivered during the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory under his leadership is developing modified asphalts with polymers, thus creating a mixture having similar characteristics as asphalt, but at the same time a greater mechanical strength and durability.
Herrera N<0xC3><0xA1>jera believes that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places with an extremely warm climate, for example in some cities in the north of the country, thus improving functionality and reducing the formation of excavations.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a grouping of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with high molecular weight, called asphalts, and others with low molecular weight, called maltenes. Together they deliver a characteristic asphalt typical viscoelasticity.
The viscoelastic nature of asphalt lies in the fact that at high temperatures, around 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees it has a high viscosity and at 50 degrees it is almost in a solid state, while at low temperatures, asphalt tends to break, he added.
This means that the resistance of asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but changes during the day according to weather conditions and temperatures, the chemical engineering expert pointed out.
A scientist from the Faculty of Chemistry observed that most of the streets of Ciudad de México are covered with flexible tiles, consisting of six layers of materials, the last three of which are mixed with asphalt.
Among the topmost layers is an asphalt inlay, formed by small stones poured into the asphalt and then compressed.
He emphasized that every stone that forms the inlay is covered with asphalt.
When passing cars or when creating pressure, it is possible for the forces in the tiles to decompose well.
If it were a modified asphalt, they would decompose even better, the chemical engineer believes.
He added that on the asphalt inlay is placed the last layer called the shell, formed by a fine stone, that is, sand also poured into the asphalt.
Since this layer will come into contact with vehicle rims, it must have greater mechanical strength than the asphalt insert and must ensure friction of the roadway.
Since as part of the paving will be exposed to a large load, the jacket must be of sufficient thickness and attention must be paid to the material from which it is made.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature changes, are also a very important factor to keep in mind. In particular, water has a great impact on the functionality of the asphalt insert.
Once the ground is moist, the water spreads inwards and it is difficult to get out, it causes softening of all layers of the tile and thus the formation of debris.
He explained that during the formation of the excavations, the film of the mantle is first damaged and then the asphalt insert is damaged. However, the damage does not occur at one moment, but it is a gradual process that should stop at the first marks with appropriate maintenance programs.
As a member of the National System of Scientists, he also explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor in the formation of excavations, and therefore the thickness of each individual layer of tile must correspond to the load of vehicles and must be ensured that this load does not exceed the load.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that in terms of asphalt, we still have a lot of work to do and research is at the beginning. It is worth mentioning, for example, asphalt emulsions, which are already available on the market in other countries and make it easy to repair effluents without having to use high temperatures.
What was missing from the candidate from Valle to become the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of factors that contributed to the fact that Melina Ramirez Serna did not win the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle thus wins the 14th title of the first multi-miss.
Valle del Cauca failed to reach the crown of Miss Colombia.
Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna had to settle for being on the podium, winning a silver crown and a sherpa, on the basis of which she became Colombia's new first multi-miss.
Based on the results of yesterday's finals in Barcelona (19990) by Giulio Garel<0xC3><0xAD>a (19990) by Giulio Garel<0xC3><0xAD>a (19990), by Giulio Garel<0xC3><0xAD>a (1990), by Giulio Garel<0xC3><0xAD>a (1990), by Giulio Garel<0xC3><0xAD>a (1990), by Giulio Garel<0xC3><0xAD>a (1990), by Giulio Garel<0xC3><0xAD>a (1990), by Giulio Garel<0xC3><0xAD>a (1990), by Giulio Garel<0xC3><0xAD>a (1990), by Giulio Garel<0xC3><0xAD>a (1990), by Giulio Garel by Giulio Garel by Giulio Garel by Giulio Garel by Giulio Garel). by Giulio Garel by Giulio Garel by Giulio Garel by Giulio Garel by Giulio Garel by Giulio).
A question that many people ask themselves. What was missing?
The result is the defeat of a great favorite, who in all previous rounds has shown that she has to become the new Miss Colombia, and not for nothing became the Queen's Police and the Most Beautiful face of Joile de Volga. These titles were achieved for example Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who subsequently became the title of Miss Colombia.
One of the key factors that decided that the jury decided to name her only First Multi-Miss is the fact that she did not convince her answer to the question, "Which book did you like the most and why?" posed by Martin Murillo G<0xC3><0xB3>mez of the literary editorship of Leamos.
When asked, the candidate replied:
"I read a lot. I very much believe in the role of literature, I think it is one of the forms of culture. The book that influenced me the most in my childhood was "Little Prince", a very deep book.
I am currently reading "Crime and Punishment". It is a book that is part of the world literature that we should all know. And today I have with me a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian author. It is a beautiful book called "El ardor de la sangre".
This answer was not liked, on the one hand, because of the term "culturalization" and, on the other hand, because the candidate did not explain what the individual books mentioned meant to her.
At the end of the ceremony, Melina declared that she was calm and happy with the result: “The world is wise, what is to happen will happen.
And you people, read if you can. The little prince is a wonderful book."
One of the other hypotheses is that Valle destroyed the position of favorite.
The Bogot<0xC3><0xA1> journalist suggested that the fact that the candidate was from the beginning the most popular, the most celebrated and the one who won all the previous awards (Gastronomical challenge Oster, the title of the public for the best artistic dress and the Queen's mother), aroused the envy of the other candidates.
This was evident in the first presentation of swimwear at Hilton Beach and during two shows before the final coronation.
Even though she glared at both, it was knowing that she lacked the strength and enthusiasm shown by the representatives of Magdalena and Atl<0xC3><0xA1>ntico.
Ariel Osorio, a reporter for "As at Home" on Channel RCN, believes that Melinda's winning the title of first multi-miss confirms the fact that the candidate who wins the most titles during the competition does not end up with the Queen's crown.
In addition, Valle has had a rather rude attitude towards the media in recent days, and it did not pay off.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of his interest in social work, which is the basis of the National Beauty Contest.
Just to the brink, two days before the election, international jury member Lucy Doughty said she was looking for a woman who would be aware of her country’s social needs.
"In the Miss Colombia competition, beauty alone is not enough, you need to see something more than just physical beauty. You need to focus on social feelings. It is important that candidates are involved in such projects even before they enter the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that the candidate Valle lost points due to the shortcomings of her background and fibrosis, which was visible on her ass. But this is completely contrary to the verdict of the jury, which chose her miss "natural beauty" for the healthiest body, proper nutrition and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Orozco, who is preparing the Queen, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better girls here, "but problems with ass fibrosis, which in my opinion was not too noticeable, took her points until the last day".
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos believes that a native of Valle made a mistake when she underwent several surgical procedures.
"Surgical interventions are fine, but they didn't work in the Valley.
The body has never been her strength, and here she has chosen her tax."
Because of this award, which was given for the first time by the National Assembly of Beauty, after the show in the swimsuits there was a cruel prediction that was fulfilled. It was claimed that this was the satisfaction that Raymundo Melina had granted, so that he did not have to give her the highest crown.
Whether it is true or not, it is certain that Melina began the year of her reign today, not as a queen, but as a princess, from a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia at various international competitions, where she will be nominated by the National Competition itself.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her staggering success in Cartagena, did not reach the highest crown.
This was the work of a Cali resident who identified the body of Alfonso Cano.
The Cali fingerprinting expert went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano.
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4 last year, a fingerprint expert from the CTI in Cali entered history as a man who confirmed the identity of the supreme leader of the Farc: "Alfonse Cana", by comparing fingerprints.
Out of seven fingerprint experts working in the CTI department, this week was Eliazar Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, a man from Puerta Tejada who has worked in forensic research for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez worked in the town hall of Choc<0xC3><0xB3>, where he often had to spend more than five days in the forest to get to a place where there were corpses that needed to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the capital of Valle, and after taking the relevant courses, he began to specialize in fingerprints. This science deals with the study of skin friction, that is, the palms of hands and feet.
In the week when the operation against Alfonso Can was carried out, El<0xC3><0xAD>azar was told to take his clothes with him for at least three days.
Something big was expected.
On Friday night, he flew to Cauca in a helicopter from Palmyra.
He knew that he would have to identify two bodies and that one of them was suspected to be the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world, so they asked him to take a card with the fingerprints of Guillermo Leon Saenza (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigative team at the spot where the corpse was, he did not recognize it because of his physical appearance. It looked completely different than in the media.
He had no beard, dressed like a villager in the area, no glasses, much slimmer.
But the prints don't lie.
Along with a gallon magnifying glass, ink, and transplanter, and light, Eliazar began to compare the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the card.
Her eye did not disappoint: it was "Alfonso Cano".
On the same night, a man from Puerto Tejada was instructed to confirm to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinz<0xC3><0xB3>n, whether it was indeed Commander-in-Chief of the Farc.
Searching for traces
For the Sij<0xC3><0xAD>n de Cali dactyloscopic, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos showed to El<0xC3><0xAD>azar Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez at the press conference of the operational service against "Cano" is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our job.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, without the possibility of error, which can play a key role in the decision-making of criminal offences.
In addition to identifying bodies, these people assist in investigating crimes such as theft or murder and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
When caught, a lot of criminals present fake documents or have no papers at all.
We'll take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The investigator said that in the case of an injury, he had to remove a piece of the house wall in the house, because the thief leaned on this place to pull out a vault full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not intended for fingerprinting, but in this case we could get a full hand print and identify the perpetrator who was involved in several thefts," he said.
Fingerprints can also confirm or refute suspicions in the event of a murder.
They recently found a dead man with bottles of alcohol around him.
Based on the investigation, it was found that one of the family members could be responsible for the murder, and the fingerprint on the bottle actually confirmed it.
Although it cannot be 100% confirmed that he was indeed a murderer, it is clear that he appeared on the crime scene.
A CTI fingerprinting expert explained that the fingerprints were “wiped off by chemical or physical reactive substances.”
When they appear, a transplanter or tape is used to collect them.
Then the prints are sent to Asif, which is a database of criminals, or to the Registry.
“The problem is that there are still a lot of Colombians at the moment whose data is not recorded anywhere,” said a CTI expert.
He explained that not everything is as shown in the CSI television program.
Like everything that shines, there is no gold, not everything you touch, there are traces.
However, if it can be used, an appropriate comparison must be made.
‘Indignation’ Protests in New York City
Hundreds of demonstrators rushed to Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to live.
A large part of them waited for the order to clear the space and moved to a nearby park.
The members of the Occupy Wall Street movement provoked New York officials on Tuesday as they tried to re-enter Manhattan Square by court order, from where they were taken out in the morning, and then tried to take over another New York park.
Hundreds of demonstrators rushed to Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to get to thanks to a court order that allowed the "angry" to return to the site. The second part of the movement responded to the clearing by taking the park to the north of the city, where there were further detentions.
"If the court does not allow us to return to the square, we will settle in another place and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, both through assemblies and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the Wall Street Occupy movement.
Bray clarified that the response of the "angry" to the camp's removal, which was ordered by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg himself, reached the court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order banning the violent removal of the site and allowing protesters to settle here and there.
In addition, "anger" took over another park located at the intersection of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the parish grounds of Trinity Church.
At least for an hour they managed to take the place, but then the police came and arrested some of the demonstrators. Bray did not know the exact number, but said he saw that some journalists were also put in shackles.
The organization assures that several hundred people have settled on the site, and a delegation of religious leaders has also come to express their support and also tried to negotiate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square, which is privately owned, remains closed, with a court hearing expected to take place on Tuesday, during which the legality of the morning evacuation should be analysed.
Some of the displaced protesters even distributed copies of the court order and even gave them to members who guarded the square, sparking “some small clashes,” said Bray, who condemned the fact that some police officers beat the protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from expelling members of the "Occupy Wall Street" movement or applying "laws that were published after the seizure began, or prohibiting protesters from accessing the park with shops or other places they previously used."
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that due to this court order, the city suspended the reopening of public space and warned protesters that local laws do not allow them to return with tents and sleeping bags.
The city’s top official personally defended the early departure of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which 200 people were detained and joined as demonstrators “violated the law.”
Bloomberg explained that he had ordered the evacuation of the square because it became "a place where people did not go to protest, but to break the laws and in some cases hurt others", because "some shops received threatening letters" and "neighbors were worried about the quality of their lives".
"The early clean-up was appalling and shows that Bloomberg is trying to maintain financial interests at the expense of the American working people," a spokesman for the movement said, accusing the mayor of "not appreciating freedom of expression."
Representatives of the Occupy Wall Street movement also said they planned to organize "big events" on Thursday in collaboration with community and trade union organizations to commemorate the two months of protests that began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will present the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show
Along with Michael Bublé and other notable Canadians, he will appear on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", swimmer in "Baywatch", bunny in "Playboy", wife of year-old musician Tommy Lee and now an actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas show on Canadian television.
CTV announced today that Anderson, along with sentimental singer Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 and will embody the Virgin Mary.
CTV today unveiled footage from a television show in which Anderson, also known from internet home pornographic footage, will appear with her ex-husband, the "Mötley Crüe" engine, Tommy Lee, as the Virgin Mary holding a doll in the cribs representing Jesus.
As Josef, Peters appears on the stage, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian descent, who recently served as a moderator on Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the CTV special features Canadian singer Bublé, who married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is close to controversy.
Bublé recently called the American Kim Kardashian "a fox" at one of her concerts in New York.
Japan Returns to Life After Destructive Earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% due to household consumption, ending the period of decline that began in March
Since March last year, Japan’s economy has been paralyzed, now recovering from a devastating earthquake that has grown into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster the country has faced since World War II.
The first estimates by the Tokyo government have estimated material losses at $300,000 million, a wound that heals well despite the difficult global situation.
After three quarters of declines, between July and September, the GDP value reached a position where it was possible to turn the page with definitive effect: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% per year.
In addition, the results of the second quarter - for the Japanese, the tax year begins in March 2012 - predict the highest rate of growth compared to the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery can be partly explained by the purchase of machines that are necessary for the restoration of areas destroyed by earthquakes and subsequent tsunamis.
Businesses increased their investments by 1.1%, spending fell by 0.9% from January to March, the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real awakening of Japan's economy is based solely on the impulse that forces us to use the crisis to get out of it by strengthening, or to rebuild infrastructure, and it is about taking advantage of the lack of it to start from scratch.
Japan has woken up, in particular due to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan’s GDP.
These variables increased by 1%, thanks to an increase in spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
Stigma yen
The tokens fell into the hands of the internal market when the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "saving values" for investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the worrying U.S. forecasts. It is a privilege, but it is also a great burden for export companies.
With a stronger currency, products abroad are more expensive, which is negative for a country whose economy is determined by the financial health of large technological groups.
For example, Toyota or Sony attributed their weak results in July to September precisely to the exchange rate of the yen.
While the markets continue to besiege the peripheral EU countries, the government of Yoshihiko Noda is cautious.
“We need to be wary of the risks that persist, such as the destruction of some foreign economies, the impact of floods in Thailand and the rapid rise of the yen,” said Motohisa Furukawa, Secretary of State for Economic Policy.
The prospects aren’t really encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said that most member countries showed clear signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator, which predicts inflexibility in the world economy, has shown that the economy of the major powers is slowing.
It fell four tenths to 100.4 points from 100.8 in August.
The euro area has even fallen below the average of 100, reaching a level of 99.13 points.
Athens is once again spreading uncertainty.
Papadimos says austerity measures will be approved, but conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With quick and risky margin guarantees and the uncertainty that has reignited again, Greece is increasingly entangled in a labyrinth that leads to the exit from Europe’s great debt crisis.
The presumption that the "agreement" of the new Greek transitional government is given to the demands of Brussels rather than to the genuine conviction of political forces is beginning to be confirmed.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday admitted that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period he was given when he was appointed is likely to be short for their application, the chairman of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, has called for a 19-day deadline for his new austerity measures.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decision of the October 26 summit," Papadimos said during a parliamentary debate that will culminate in a confidence vote tomorrow.
The package of 24 programmes to support employment, the reform of the Official Disciplinary Code and new measures against tax evasion will be among the first initiatives.
However, Samarase's message does not in any way clarify any doubts about his position: "We have committed ourselves to assisting the transitional government, but we have not committed ourselves to anything else."
The President of the Conservatives went a little far in his speech to the EU and the IMF. These organizations are to unlock the 8 billion that Athens urgently needs. But at the same time he said that he will not support and will not sign any commitment regarding the implementation of austerity measures.
The European Commission, which is already plagued by the impact of Papandreou's referendum games, stressed yesterday that its demands are insurmountable: it will not unlock any help unless the new government and the leaders of the main parties sign a "written commitment without ambiguity and as far as possible".
Amadeu Altafaj, a spokesman for Economic Affairs, explained that inspectors from the Troika will return to Athens "very soon" and will negotiate with the new government about "what it needs to pay for the sixth part" of the 8 billion.
The Greek windmill has something to knit around for a while.
Queen Sofia: "There are tools for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights the privileged position of Spain in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has achieved a significant position at the global level in terms of microfinance".
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that in the last two decades the country has become the second donor of the planet in terms of this instrument of cooperation, the essence of which lies in the fact that "it is an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind.
The Queen yesterday launched the 5th World Summit of Microloans in Valladolid, with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that this type of operation "is absolutely necessary" for us to achieve the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations by 2015.
Spain "will continue to work" and expand the network of volunteers "in all corners of the planet and take this task responsibly", said Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contribution of the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "will ensure the creation of better capacities and opportunities for the most vulnerable".
“We’ve already achieved a lot” and “many challenges are still ahead of us.”
The micro-loan summit is intended to be not only a discussion forum, but also a platform to support the “basic goals”.
Her Majesty has explained that the goal is for 175 million poor families to have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and for 100 million families to get over the poverty line under which they currently live.
The concept of microloans has spread to Spain and other countries of the world after "the pioneer of the idea Muhammad Yunus embarked on this journey," the Queen said, adding that it was "an act of justice and the necessary recognition."
She described the instrument as "an admirable idealist who set out on a path to fight poverty." She became acquainted with his work 15 years ago when she went to Bangladesh to get acquainted with his loan policy directly on the spot.
This experience was followed by the first world summit in Washington, D.C., and other meetings such as in Ivory Coast in 1999, in Canada in 2006. "In all these meetings, I was able to note the constant development," explained the Queen, who, thanks to her support for the project, "earned the title of "the family" yesterday.
Queen Sofia concluded her speech by inviting the participants to engage in discussions and search for solutions, thus allowing them to continue the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez said that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" that all democracies must follow.
In this sense, she said that it would be a mistake to associate cooperation with developing countries only with a period of balochistan, because this cooperation is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez believes that microloans represent a "serious and fair policy to eradicate poverty", and now more than ever, governments of developed countries must work in accordance with the criteria of solidarity and not allow solidarity to become a victim of cuts.
For Spain, microloaning is one of the main lines of development cooperation.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, welcomed the success, which celebrates the concept based on giving confidence to the people to whom everyone else is closing the doors. The Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Le<0xC3><0xB3>n de la Riva welcomed the participants in the city, which "opens its doors to the spirit of solidarity".
CDU proposes to elect European president on the basis of universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) was held in Leipzig on Monday, 14 November, without serious problems for the chancellor and the president of the Christian Democratic Party, Angela Merkel.
The question of Europe's future was not originally on the agenda, but only in the autumn, especially to reassure party members who consider the government's policy towards the Greeks today and perhaps the Italians tomorrow to be lax.
The proposal concerning the President of the European Commission submitted by the management was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine of the 1001 delegates voted against and 10 abstained.
The few-minute ovations at the end of Angela Merkel’s speech and a few hours later by Wolfgang Schäuble, a very pro-European finance minister, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the proposal can be summed up in a slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not just because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
According to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, “the time for change has come.”
This could be expressed in changes to the Treaty of Lisbon allowing the European Union to strengthen its control over the budgetary policies of the euro area member states, but it could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of universal suffrage "in order to give Europe a single face".
In any case, this is one of the ideas of the proposal adopted by the Congress, which is clearly inspired by Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is certainly unlikely that all twenty-seven countries will quickly agree on this revolutionary step: Great Britain is opposed, and CDU leaders think Nicolas Sarkozy will take the same stance.
But the direction is pointed.
Similarly, delegates rejected by a large majority the proposal to assess the weight of each country on the board of the European Central Bank depending on the weight of its economy, which will obviously result in a strengthening of Germany's weight.
Led by concerns about calming the climate within her party, the chancellor made several references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she did not try to get Congress to talk about "small" European states or states in trouble willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Although the proposal on Europe dedicates one paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not quote France.
Indirectly only.
When she recalled that just two hundred years ago there was a bloody battle at Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is incapacity for work fraud?
After the aid, the UMP party and the government launch an offensive against incapacity for work.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 December and will visit the Office for Social Assistance, where he will give a speech on a recurring theme since 2007 on the fight against social fraud and the redistribution of solidarity.
As an accompaniment to this offensive, which comes from the will to make savings in the context of increased rigor, but is not less clear from the perspective of the right-wing presidential campaign, the right-wing majority wants to focus on incapacity for work.
First, because of budget savings, the government intends to impose a fourth day of incapacity on employees in the private sector before they start taking sick support.
Clearly, without the approval of the company, an employee who becomes ill would lose four days of wages, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that risks causing a lot of bad blood, but which, according to the newspaper Les Echos, could bring 280 million euros.
And also measures that would be accompanied by other measures of symbolic scope: to give state employees one day of unpaid incapacity for work (until now they have no incapacity compared to three days in the private sector).
While these issues are the subject of debate, the right-wing majority is also launching a fraud issue this time focused on malfeasance linked to incapacity to work.
"The controls will be much more extensive and in addition: if you are caught, you will come back," Xavier Bertrand told RTL in an interview on Sunday.
As in other cases, the effects of the notification appear to be somewhat disproportionate in view of the truth about incapacity to work irregularities.
These have in fact been the subject of constant monitoring since 2002 and the political onslaught that has been bearing fruit.
The French are not more sick than anywhere else in Europe.
Let’s start with a few official numbers.
According to the Caisse nationale d'assurance maladie (CNAM), more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>237 million in daily allowances were paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Health Research and Documentation, daily reimbursements amounted to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.3 billion of 5% of health spending in 2008.
Of this amount, 46% concerned maternity allowances and occupational injuries and 54% concerned incapacity to work, i.e. <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6.2 billion.
That’s only 2.5% of the cost of healthcare.
According to a study by Alma Consulting, the French had an average of 14.5 days of incapacity for work in 2010, compared with 17.8 days in 2009.
The average that hides certain deviations: Another survey published in 2007 on job opportunities pages at Monster.com showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed answered that they had not chosen any day of incapacity for work.
Another study, this time conducted by health insurance institutions, specifies that in 2010, 37.8% of incapacity for work was shorter than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to three months, and 11% lasted longer.
When we compare them with their European neighbours, French workers are not more prone to incapacity for work than elsewhere.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS (National Research Centre) researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001 total absence (for health reasons or not) in France ranged between 10% and 11.8% versus 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud at work incapacity represents only a very small part compared to black work.
As for fraud, these are only of a small scale.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to systematic checks aimed at incapacity for more than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM noted that in 1.5 million controls, 13.8% of 285,000 were carried out due to short-term incapacities "unauthorised or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically controlled incapacities longer than 45 days, 11% of cases "unadapted or unauthorised" were counted against 1.2 million controls, i.e. 132,000.
A total of 169 000 "unauthorised" cases per several million employees who had incapacity for work.
A number that represents much less than a number expressing work in black.
According to UMP MEP Dominique Tiana, author of the June report on this issue, this figure would represent <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 billion missing in tax collection per year, i.e. more than the total amount of daily allowances and thus infinitely more than the frauds associated with the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to apply a new rescue plan
Greece will need a new bailout program to rebuild its economy.
On Monday, 14 December, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said in front of parliament that the 100 days of unity given to his government would not be enough to accomplish this task.
"In order to rebuild our economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new bailout budget," the head of government said as he gave his first public speech at the start of the parliamentary confidence vote on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, as the participation of our country in the euro area is at stake, he added.
As a result, Mr Papademos predicted that the country’s public deficit would be “around 9%” of gross domestic product from now until the end of the year, after it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Lawmakers reject new austerity measures
Right-wing leader Antonis Samaras on Monday expressed his support for the already approved measures to try to escape the debt crisis, but warned that his party is not committing to any additional austerity measures.
"We will not raise our hand for any new measures," Samaras stressed at a meeting with lawmakers for his New Democracy party.
We have agreed on targets for reducing deficits and debt and combating waste, but we are against any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
To Mr Ollim Rehn, the European Commissioner for the Economy and Currency, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8 billion loan without a written guarantee from all parties that would support the proposed measures, Antonis Samaras replied that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
We need to legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, experts say
According to a report by the Royal Canadian Society, Canadians are denied death.
With regard to palliative care, the Commission urges governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cancer cases.
Canadian society lives on the idea of denying death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually accept the opportunity to talk to a doctor about the conditions in which they want to die, and make decisions in this regard.
This is one of the conclusions of an extensive report by the Royal Canadian Society, which involved six experts working in various fields, including ethics, law, and medicine.
This committee recommends that the government amend criminal law to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, if such a choice appears necessary for a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
At the outset, experts cite a recent survey by the independent Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the planet.
Although Canada is ranked 10th, the study notes that "medicalization of death in Canada has given rise to a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death."
Medication yes or no, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts with a mandate from the Royal Canadian Society.
And despite the desire to die at home that most Canadians have, 68.6% of them die in hospital.
This average applies to all of Canada, while in the province of Quebec, this number is the highest with 86% of people dying in hospital.
With regard to the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the report’s authors come to conclusions that run counter to the position of the federal government, which has already said that it does not want to change anything about the criminal law relating to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
According to experts who have also subjected all countries where such approaches are legalized or not considered criminal, there is no evidence that this decriminalization causes any abuse in the application, i.e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide of persons who are inappropriate or dissenting.
On the contrary, Mr. Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, confirmed at a teleconference yesterday more than numerous cases of these abuses in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Euthanasia is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
“Assisted suicide is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,” explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians are prone to euthanasia
According to a 2010 Angus Reid survey, 85% of Canadians have already spoken in favor of euthanasia because they believe it will allow end-of-life people to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that the legalization of euthanasia will not mean that we are sending a message that the lives of the elderly or the disabled are of lesser value.
As for people who practice assisted suicide, 41% of respondents say they should not be prosecuted.
When it comes to maintaining or interrupting patient care, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
They also propose in the list of their recommendations that criminal law should state that withdrawal from treatment for which there is a legally confirmed refusal is not criminal.
The Commission of Experts also requires professional physicians to be trained to respect the refusal of end-of-life treatment without fear of prosecution.
With regard to palliative care, the Commission urges governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cancer cases.
Finally, in the case of palliative or final cessation already widely used in Canadian health facilities, the Commission calls for it to be considered euthanasia at a time when it is no longer used to reduce physical pain and to be subject to the same procedures.
Other experts' reservations
Some medical law experts have already expressed their reservations regarding the findings of the Royal Canadian Society’s expert report.
Mr Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in medical law, described the position of expert signatories of the report as "extreme" among other things because it does not restrict the practice of euthanasia to the sick in the final stage.
“This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and is over the age of 18 could ask to be helped commit suicide,” said Pierre Deschamps, who studied the report’s summaries yesterday.
Deschamps also points out that it looks as if the authors of the report have built the autonomy of the person above all other values that form the social fabric of society.
Because "in society, he says, there are warning signs and restrictions."
Medical Law Specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong objections to the conclusions of the report, which she described as a "manifest for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Canadian Society, especially doubts the data of the report on the absence of error in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, i.e. in the Netherlands and the US state of Oregon.
Jordan's King Urges President Assad to Resign
Damascene talks about "conspiracy"
Syria is becoming more and more isolated.
The supporters of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressures on Syria by President Bashar al-Assad intensified, resisting them with the support of Russia and talking about a "complot" against his country.
Two days after Syria’s suspension of membership in the Arab League, the European Union tightened its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, Syria’s neighbours, took a stand in favor of President Assad’s departure.
Yesterday, King Abdullah II of Jordan was the first Arab ruler to call on President Bashar al-Assad to kill about 40 civilians and members of the regime’s military forces in Syria.
"If Bashar had the interests of his country at heart, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life," the king of Jordan, a neighboring country to Syria, said in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu lamented that efforts to mediate with the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been crowned with success.
"Those who do not live in peace with their people in the Middle East and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, referring to neighboring Syria, which Turkey is increasingly pursuing.
The United States welcomed the "strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the dishonest conduct of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States, countries like Turkey are applying an increasingly harsh tone" against the repression in Syria, Mark Toner, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, 16 civilians and 19 members of pro-regime forces were killed in the southern Syrian city of Deraa during this time.
According to the NGO, two other civilians were killed "in shootings and concentrated shootings from heavy machine guns in the city of Jobar" in the Homs area.
However, at a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouall estimated that the country was “going out of the crisis”.
He also reacted lively to the decision of the League of Arab States to suspend Damascus' membership, which he said was a "dangerous step".
Syria "does not bow," he added, reassuring that "conspiracies against Syria will not succeed."
Following its decision to suspend Syria's membership, the League of Arab States is currently considering a "civil protection mechanism" and plans to send 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé is also in favour of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which he says is acting "paranoidly".
A new special meeting of the League is convened tomorrow in Rabat to take an opinion on the plan to resolve the crisis, which was decided on 2 December and which specifically envisaged the withdrawal of armies from cities suffering from disputes and the release of imprisoned demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called the Arab League's decision "flawed" yesterday, while China urged Syria to adopt a plan to resolve the crisis, while avoiding support for possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy's
Monti demands time and sacrifice in Italy
Italy's next prime minister, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for some time to form his team and start implementing a program that will include "victims" in order to regain the credibility lost in the last months of Berlusconi's government.
The former European Commissioner discussed with political parties yesterday before meeting with representatives of trade unions and employers today.
It should build a relatively slender cabinet made up of technocrats who do not belong to parliamentary parties.
"Monti talked about an important program with many victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the numerous parliamentary groups participating in the talks, after meeting with the appointed prime minister.
House Speaker Gianfranco Fini expects Mario Monti to ask parliament for confidence on Friday to make sure the new government has enough support.
The consultation will end with Mario Monti introducing a small team of twelve ministers to President Giorgi Napolitano.
Yesterday, Mario Monti commented on the nervousness in the financial markets and asked them for time.
In "democracy, there are precise deadlines" for the preparation of the government and its program, he stressed, adding that he was "certain that the markets will be patient and understanding".
His appointment as president was initially welcomed by the markets, but concerns reappeared after the unexpected September decline of industrial production in the euro area.
The appointed Prime Minister should put together a team consisting mainly of technocrats, although he stressed that he would also like to adopt "politics".
He expressed his belief that the new government will last until 2013, i.e. until the date of the next elections.
According to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Gianfranco Fini, the new government will get the confidence of Parliament by Friday.
After taking office, Mario Monti promised to act with extreme urgency and with the aim of making Italy "again a strong member" of Europe.
European Commissioner Olli Rehn's spokesman stressed that "even with the new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change".
The European Union is convinced that, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, Rome will not achieve its target of a balanced budget in 2013, and calls for new tough measures.
Confindustria chief Emma Marcegagli, who will meet with Monti on Tuesday, has focused on the need to revive the economy "because a country that does not show growth cannot meet the deficit parameters".
Mario Monti, a former European Commissioner (1994-2004) recognized for his expertise and independence, a "professor" symbolizing, according to the authors of the introductions, "the call to seriousness" and "another Italy", represents for Italy a "epochal change" after 17 years of "Berlusconism".
A big unknown will be the life of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy must place 200 billion euros in government bonds by April 2012.
Soviet Scientist Helped Iran’s Nuclear Program
Soviet scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator suitable for nuclear weapons, a U.S. non-governmental organization specializing in nuclear risks said on Tuesday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on a recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents leaked from that UN agency to identify the scientist.
Last week, the IAEA said it was "seriously concerned" about the "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to the ISIS Institute, which draws extensively on IAEA documents, V. Danilenko (born 1934) was to work for three decades since the 1960s at the Soviet military research center in Chelyabinsk (Ural), where he was to deal with the production of synthetic diamonds by the explosion method.
In 1989 or 1991, he had to leave the center to start a company producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company should have led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Prior to his return to Russia, he was to collaborate on the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report, the IAEA recalls "clear data that the development of the detonation system carried out by Iran" was based "on the work of a foreign specialist who not only knew this method well, but who - as one Member State informed the Agency - worked during a substantial part of his country's working career on this technology in the framework of the military".
Anti-Muslim crimes and offences increased by 50%
According to FBI statistics released on Monday, the number of crimes and offenses targeting Muslims increased by almost 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racial and religious violence declined slightly or little at the same time.
According to these figures, the total number of violence committed against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. 49% increase compared to the 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews and a 14% increase in anti-religious crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" rose very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
“After the loss in 2009, it is disturbing to see these criminal acts and offences rise again,” Human Rights First said in a statement, adding that “the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant.”
“Human Rights First has long emphasized that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crime, must be considered a serious violation of human rights,” said Paul Legendre, one of the leaders of the organization.
“The U.S. government can and must do more to deal with these atrocities,” he adds, and estimates that this could be done by improving police reports of “hate crimes.”
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law is the legacy of the civil rights struggle.
This legal order was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence related to race, skin color, religion, origin and now also sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing and looks more like Facebook.
Twitter's microblogging site introduced a design change on Monday to allow its users to observe followers' activity, somewhat mimicking its Facebook services.
The new "Activity" and "Name" offers allow you to better and directly know the activities of other people who are following you or people whose responses ("tweets") you are following.
This lets you know if they let you track posts, if they sign in to new accounts, if they have favorite posts, etc.
This new face of Twitter was tested "in August on a small percentage of users" before being extended to the entire network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive functioning, with terms somewhat incomprehensible (RT for the repeated dissemination of someone else's post, followfriday to recommend to follow another user) making the happiness of the initiates, thus opens up to a wider audience with a more public handling and that of Facebook networks.
On the network, users immediately in their "tweets" differently assess the importance of this innovation.
“It’s useless, it takes up a lot of space, and it’s too much like Facebook,” <0x40>jemb123 wrote.
"The Activity feature will help me better track some elements of my Twitter," <0x40>dannykronstrom said.
Austro-Hungarian Empire
enrollment of the golden rule on a balanced budget in the Constitution
The government of the large coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats, which is in power in Austria, decided on Tuesday to enroll a "golden rule" of fiscal policy in the constitution in order to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid any possible reduction in Austria's rating by rating agencies (AA).
It was the same Social Democratic Chancellor, Werner Faymann, who announced this decision at the end of the ministerial meeting in a situation where the Austrian public debt, with its 74.6%, is high above the criterion of a maximum of 60% set by the Maastricht agreement, but much lower than the debt of countries such as Italy, Greece and Greece.
“If Austria’s solvency were reduced by just one degree from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion more on interest each year,” said Michael Spindelegger, a Christian Democrat.
Austria is thus following up on the request of the euro area summit held in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where the Heads of State or Government strongly called for the reduction of the public deficit and the achievement of a balance of public accounts to be enshrined in the constitution or in the law of the same value by the end of 2012.
The tool adopted by the Austrian government is close to the "German model", Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to fall every year by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP), and starting in 2017, the public structural deficit of the federal state will not be allowed to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the federal states, as well as the municipalities, will have to report a balance sheet.
The aim is to bring public debt under the 60% criterion set out in the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/21.
Strong only
Noda threatens new intervention in foreign exchange markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese institutions would have to intervene again in foreign exchange markets if they were to continue strengthening.
"We will strike like we did last time, if we find too much volatility" in the exchange rate of yen, Y. Noda explained.
On Tuesday, it only rose again to the historic values that forced the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo was selling yen for dollars to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which recently surpassed the record against the dollar in force since 1945.
But only since then has it steadily risen supported by purchases by investors who consider it a “safe haven” in uncertain times of global economic slowdown and European debt crisis.
The dollar again fell below 77 yen on Tuesday and the euro fell below the symbolic bar of 105 yen to near the levels that triggered the latest intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar had a value of about 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This surge in Japanese currency is detrimental to island exports, as it increases the price of Made in Japan products and lowers the value of revenues earned by Japanese companies from abroad when they convert them into domestic currencies.
"Japan is recovering" from the devastation caused by the March earthquake and tsunami wave that devastated the Tohoku region in the country's northeast, Y. Noda said, fearing that the yen price hike would kill a fragile recovery in the egg.
The third economic power in the world resumed growth in the third quarter (1.5% compared to the previous quarter) for the first time in a year, thanks to a survey of growth in exports and consumption of households burdened by disasters.
But the prime minister ruled that the high value of the yen did not reflect "Japan's national economy."
Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Central Bank of Japan (BoJ), which launched a two-day meeting of its political and monetary council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures leading to the weakening of the yen.
But the institution’s multi-governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, said the BoJ had previously taken “appropriate measures” suggesting no additional currency weakening could be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the Institute for Securities Issuance increased its purchases of state treasury notes by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) and increased the ceiling of 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) for purchases of various securities in order to flood with liquidity.
Eurozone:
rates are rising, the stock markets are failing
The risk of the debt crisis is still undermining European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, rates of weakened countries continue to grow.
European exchanges, still concerned about the stability of the euro area, are falling into negative expectations on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 loses 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The Dax index in Frankfurt loses 0.4% and in London 0.1%.
“With new tensions surrounding the euro area’s borrowing revenues, which are in trouble, stock markets around the world continue to deliver only a fraction of recent profits.”
"Nervous investors are only too aware of the risk of the infection," Terry Pratt, an IG Markets broker, told Reuters.
The stock market in Tokyo closed with a 0.7% decline, which suffered due to concerns by market participants about Europe's ability to cope with the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes on Europe, and the trade will only continue in a narrow corridor of variation until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilized,” Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management, said in a statement.
This relaunch of uncertainty about the future of the euro area is hurting the currency itself, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro has reached its lowest level since a month and a half ago.
At 10 a.m., the European currency is valued at $1.3570, with a decline of 0.4%.
According to brokers, the currency rebounded after Chancellor Angela Merkel’s CDU party adopted a proposal at its congress on Monday for countries in trouble to leave the eurozone without having to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far beyond the limit 6%
Interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain at a very alarming level.
On Tuesday morning, the yield on Italian ten-year bonds reaches 6.85% and the yield on Spanish ten-year bonds is 6.2%.
These tensions affecting the interest rates of the countries of southern Europe, but also in France, continue to reinforce the concerns of market participants.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, strongly demanded time in the markets to correct the situation in Italy threatened by poisoning caused by the amount of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, has confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the eurozone summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of his government.
Spain is once again in a deliberate line of markets as the country holds parliamentary elections on Sunday.
The spread between the ten-year bonds of Germany and Spain has reached a new historical high.
In anticipation of euro area growth figures
Statistics show that France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, mainly driven by household consumption, i.e. slightly better than expected growth of 0.3%.
The French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies, however, revised down its second-quarter figures to a decline of 0.1% of GDP instead of stagnation.
This is the fourth quarter that is most troubling to economists.
Germany, for its part, recorded growth of 0.5% during the same period.
The first estimates for the entire euro area are expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has just warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy Policy:
The facts must prevail over the dogmas.
If there is a topic that cannot be grasped on the basis of short-term balances or under emotions, then it is energy policy.
The availability and price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of enterprises.
It is natural for an election meeting to be an opportunity to think about such deposits and the place that the energy from the core occupies.
The debate will only be successful if all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options are explored.
The French must base their position on objective facts and rational data.
So far, there are 7 billion human beings on the planet, but demographic developments will cause electricity demand to double by 2050 if we don’t want to rid a significant part of the world’s population of important parts of life.
At the same time, it will be necessary to address the scarcity of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity, while not forgetting the necessary need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change, which is an issue that is currently disappearing from environmental debates.
The accident in Fukushima does not affect any of these parameters.
And that is why Germany remains alone in its decision to reject nuclear energy.
This is not the case, however, for Belgium, which submits its decision to the need to find some other source capable of replacing itself, nor for Switzerland, which considers it appropriate to build only the last generation power plants.
Conversely, the UK, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some countries, continue to be determined in their projects.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to expand its park by one unit by rebuilding the construction of a single power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island power plant crash.
If the German model based on renewable energies is sometimes presented as an example, reality contradicts it.
The choice of Berlin will be manifested by the price of electricity, the increased energy dependence on gas imported especially from Russia, the sharp increase in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of natural gas and coal power plants.
We will feel all these unpleasant effects in a few months.
The case of Denmark deserves us to think about it.
The European champion in wind power plants, of which 30% of its electricity is taken, is also one of the largest consumers of coal and gas due to wind irregularities, which is why CO2 emissions and Danish electricity prices are 65% and 50% higher than the European average, respectively.
On the contrary, thanks to the immutability of our energy policy, our neighbours will pay the electricity bill 40% higher than what the payment of French households makes.
While in a globalised economy energy costs are a key factor in competitiveness and guaranteeing the maintenance of industry on national territory, French companies enjoy the benefits of the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would trigger a sharp increase in the price of electricity, which would make illusory beautiful statements about the re-industrialization of our country and the defense of the purchasing power.
The price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay, just as they are not fundamentally opposed to this energy, as the opinion polls show.
Recall that our country’s energy policy has enabled the sector to build with 125,000 direct jobs and with 410,000 subsequent jobs.
The highly exporting sector is dragging on to international markets a large number of small and medium-sized specialised job-creating enterprises that cannot be transferred abroad.
If France decides to leave the nucleus, it would sacrifice a large number of these small and medium-sized enterprises and lose 6 billion euros a year, which the country receives from the export of nuclear facilities and services.
Which owner of the power plant would order a nuclear reactor designed to operate for 60 years, while its manufacturer’s downfall would be planned?
When solving the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no magic source for energy production, but that there is no devil source.
The development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable energy plants by the French industrial group AREVA demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is absolutely necessary to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have the State Office for Nuclear Safety, which carries out uncompromising and transparent oversight of existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of a new plant in Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, have an idea of safety in the blood.
In 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three major accidents.
The only one in Three Mile Island that happened in normal operating conditions and was left with no human casualties and no environmental impact.
In Chernobyl, the drama caused reactor concepts and inexcusable human errors.
In the case of Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented scale that caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will take lessons from this crash just as it did from the previous two.
The fruit of this step and the cooperation between the French and German nuclear safety authorities, operators and constructors is that the EPR reactor represents a concept capable of resisting such phenomena.
While all interested parties wishing to build a nuclear power plant consider it, stopping its construction in Flamanville would be an excellent gift to AREVA and EDF’s competitors and pave the way for them to take a leading position in nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy solutions for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and machinations dominate the debate so crucial to our country’s economic, social and financial situation.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy pursued under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles - the overcrowding of the police, courts and administration under the policy of numbers, the compatibility of this policy with the status of "land of human rights", which France boasts.
Recently, it was an administrative harassment, the object of which were foreign students, which became topical when the Minister of the Interior (see the newspaper Libération of 23 May) declared that France "does not need foreign talents, masons and maids".
But so far, it has rarely been discussed from an economic point of view.
Needless to say, there is a fairly wide agreement between the left and the right in this area.
In 1976, Jacques Chirac stated that “900,000 unemployed people should not be a problem in a country where there are 2 million immigrant workers” and on the left, Michel Rocard, when in 1990 he said that France “cannot accept all the misery of the world”.
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, fears of the invasion of hordes of Polish plumbers in French territory were shared by both the right and the left.
In both camps, immigrants are perceived as a burden on the economy and French society.
The only difference lies in the degree of generosity that we prevent immigrants from giving.
In his program, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande confines himself to banality, stating that joint development will allow us to solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem may apply in elections, but economically it is very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in their recently published work on migration synthesizing the latest knowledge about immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.).
Reducing immigration cripples growth and harms employment.
Concerns about the impacts caused by migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially the less skilled, and create pressure to cut their wages.
But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for French employees by performing jobs in sectors with a shortage of employees.
Low-skilled immigrants in sectors that do not attract French workers, and those most skilled in dynamic sectors where education is not enough to offer jobs.
Positive impact on wages
Just as a surgeon will have trouble working in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, these additions between French and migrants cause immigrant arrivals to have a positive impact on the wages and employment of French employees.
Giovanni Peri calculated that the increase in migration movements by 1% will cause a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And it does not take into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (the high proportion of naturalized immigrants among US Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems in European countries at an average of 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that in Germany, one immigrant who arrives at the age of 30 will bring a net contribution (income minus expenses) of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150000 to public budgets for his entire life.
At the beginning of his term, Nicolas Sarkozy expressed a desire to find the missing percentages of growth "with priced teeth".
The teeth used to deter immigrants had the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, it remains to think about European democracy.
Democracy is a rare and very fragile commodity.
The European continent should remember this, for although it invented it two thousand years ago in Athens, it experienced during the 20th century the tragedy of world wars, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the gulags, but also France in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, and the colonels.
Some people might have believed that in order for democracy to triumph over its enemies definitively, it would be enough to make a choice and make it as direct as possible.
However, it is already known from Napoleon that it was an ease of thought.
Universal suffrage, while a necessary condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition and can become a “tool of oppression,” as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization of separation and control of powers, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis of Europe we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it has been so since the beginning of the crisis of politics and democracy.
Admitting the mistake of the Greek referendum of the yes-no type will have the value of a double revelation in this regard: the revelation of the necessity of a great return of political power, but also the revelation of a disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its inadequacy.
This ambivalence must be thought through in order to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of democratic hunting have shifted today and that many of the Republican fighters are no longer shooting in the right direction.
We cannot gain anything if we demand a series of national referendums organised as necessary and disorganised.
Bianko exposed to a European absolutist monarch or jumping with tied feet into the void of nationalist depths: what a choice for a citizen!
No, we do not want guillotine knives, but a common, full-fledged, peaceful and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we would not know where to stop it - because there is a crisis in Europe.
Indeed, it is the whole of Europe that is bowing to the dictates of markets and rating agencies, suffering from its incompetence and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is being humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty and every one of its peoples with it.
The European project of democratic sovereignty needs to be reinstated as a matter of urgency.
Because only together will Europeans be able to reduce the burden of their debts, get rid of market governments and prepare the future by investing.
The exit from the crisis will entail decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, otherwise it would lead us to disaster.
After a long struggle against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today strongly calls for a European economic government.
Oh, come on.
But to think that without stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such by citizens, would be a new madness and a new dead end.
We need to take on a new stage of European construction.
In order to form a republic in France, it was necessary to be a republican.
A revolution of interest was not enough.
This lesson continues to apply.
We need to build a Europe that is more economically integrated.
This can only be achieved by building a Europe of more politically democratic and genuine European democratic sovereignty.
Let us become Europeans to build Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards are spreading
In an optimistic atmosphere, the world chip card fair will open on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 is expected to end with a 11% increase in world sales of microprocessor cards (bank cards, phones with SIM cards) to more than 6 billion units.
The most bearable is the contactless technology segment, which allows you to pay in bulk or handle purchases by simply bringing the card closer to the reader.
This year, 460 million chip cards are expected to be sold worldwide, compared to 320 million sold a year earlier!
Their share is expected to increase further in 2012 (expected 580 million units) to reach approximately 10% of the total chip card market (6.925 million cards).
After having been in the APEC countries for a long time, Europe is gaining ground in contactless payments.
Approximately 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards have been issued.
But big business chains work for two.
Carrefour has released 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCards this year.
In order to qualify for a higher rate, banks need to equip their clients with them from now on.
“Two large French companies have committed to systematically distributing contactless bank cards to their clients in the future,” said Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile payments
But this is only the first stage to the payment method of the future: a mobile phone.
The NFC (Near Field Communication) technology required for the execution of transactions is now equipped with only a small number of devices.
"They're late."
“But their real growth is expected to take place next year.”
“For 2012, we estimate their worldwide sales to be 80 to 120 million units,” explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are already preparing ahead.
Crédit agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test conducted in the city of Caen, which will last from December to June next year.
The iPhone devices of approximately 200 clients and associates will be equipped with a case that allows contactless payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
Société Générale also announced yesterday that it is preparing to introduce an offer allowing its clients to pay by mobile phone without touch.
The terrorist front stretches from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about ties between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Long-term suspicions that there are ties between the Al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algeria's Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algeria had "gained certainty" about it from now on.
"The way the two organizations operate and intelligence reports show that there is great cooperation between them," he said.
It seems that Paris has similar analyses.
An investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger in January 2010 could help illuminate the bridges.
After being kidnapped by AQMI members from a restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day at the same time as several of their kidnappers in an operation carried out by French special forces.
French and Nigerian investigators had to find several phones with chips belonging to the terrorists in the ruins after the intervention.
Terrorist Axis
The analysis of the conducted calls leads to several people in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in two numbers: one leads to a Nigerian who has long lived in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria that is the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a person who is said to have close to AQMI and the sect.
“It’s progress, but there’s no doubt we need to wait for more convincing evidence before we start talking about operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram.”
"But it's possible."
“We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and that it is increasingly active,” said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian investigator.
In recent months, this "support" has become more and more apparent in the development and manifestations of Boko Haram or its operational procedures, which now include human victims or increasingly complex explosive devices of the same design as the devices used by AQMI.
The international community, led by Washington, has since exerted pressure on Nigeria to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities, in fact, for a long time considered the group to be a community of enlightened mystics of little interest.
Quick Success
The Boko Haram sect was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around the mosque, school and fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf. Boko Haram, which in the language of haoussa means "Western education is a sin", approves the establishment of the Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, such a connection has a rapid success.
The sect politicizes and demands strict adherence to Islamic Sharia law, while its adherents launch a fight against the central government.
These people focus first on churches, bars, and offices.
In 2009, Boko Haram supporters became extremely active and multiplied their attacks on police stations.
As usual, the government’s response remains the same.
The army encircled the city, killing 800 people.
The founder of the sect, Mohammed Yusuf, is arrested and killed in prison.
Since then, the group has been radicalizing and leaving its ground in the north.
At Christmas 2010 he carried out an assassination in the city of Jos, in which 80 people were killed, followed by another in the capital Abuja.
In June, it is again in Abuja, where Boko Haram will attack the police headquarters in his first suicide attack.
And in August, the local UN office will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which should lead from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is now of concern to all security specialists.
Now that Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb has surrounded Mali and the games and Somalis of the Al-Shabab movement are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new danger to the continent.
Last week in Nigeria, in an interview with President Goodluck, Alain Juppé said that France was in a state of emergency and was ready to "transmit all information".
The World According to Presidential Candidates
When it comes to China, Iran or helping Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry are leading the way in simplification and ignorance.
Can America, weakened by the crisis, manage the world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to the presidential candidates, voters might think so.
For a few days Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have been repeating noisy statements and brief instructions on foreign policy, which has traditionally been a strong point of the Republicans.
Often unsubstantiated slogans about China, Iran or helping Israel merge.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the Republican Grand Old Party nomination race, has threatened to summon the Chinese before the World Trade Organization and accuse them of “manipulating their currency,” a bearish theme in America fuelled by the migration of entire parts of its industry to Asia.
Worse still, if this must include the launching of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate with some sophisticated vision of foreign policy, has almost cracked down on an attitude that “smooths” emotions.
He called for a tough but constructive dialogue with Beijing (President Obama’s current stance).
But Huntsman, who is in last place in the election estimates, remains unheard of.
In the face of President Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop his nuclear program.
"If I am elected, I will imprison Iran," he said in a fanfare.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have a bomb."
He also promised to increase military assistance to Israel, accusing Obama of disappointing his obligations to this partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, demonstrates a shameful ignorance of documents.
He recently called for a sharp stance against the Chinese military threat because Beijing is "trying to develop nuclear capabilities" - apparently unaware of the fact that China has had a nuclear weapon since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he is ready to send the U.S. military to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists banned by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Cain, Perry and another candidate, Michele Bachmann.
Everyone is far away from Republican candidate John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy, in 2008.
Opponents of the current president say that Reagan also had simple ideas and yet won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They emphasize the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the hasty departure of the “boys” from Iraq, his excuses regarding Libya, and thus attribute to him the label of a weak
But the attack is not easy.
The population is looking at President Obama’s national security policy, which Ben Laden removed, rather positively.
Iraq has no confidence in the military interventions that lead to the meltdown.
And with the arguments that America needs to be reconstructed economically in order to resuscitate its leadership position, Obama is knocking on the right place.
Nord Stream, the new port of entry of Russian gas to Europe
The Nord Stream long-distance gas pipeline connecting Eastern Europe directly to Russia and running along the bottom of the Baltic Sea began to operate.
They have to supply gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event properly.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of Nord Stream, a new pipeline that connects Russia and Germany under the sea.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte turned the control valve of the Russian gas inlet to the Western European network together.
This new gas pipeline will begin flowing 27.5 billion additional cubic meters of Russian gas into Western Europe each year through the first 1,224 km long pipeline connecting the St. Petersburg region with the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern state.
The second pipeline, to be completed at the end of 2012, will provide a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, which is equivalent to the total French consumption.
And it is already recalled the possibility of building the third pipeline on the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge building has the character of victory.
Poland and the Baltic states protested strongly against the project.
In fact, Nord Stream will make it possible to deliver gas directly to Germany without being led around the country by any third country (Poland or Ukraine).
At the same time, the two countries are losing some power: the ability to pressure Russia with threats to close its access to Western European markets is becoming more difficult for them.
Warsaw expressed this most strongly when it did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream to the "new German-Soviet pact", with reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin during the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that it is a politically sensitive issue.
Western Europe, with its support for this Russian project, has gained greater confidence in its purchases.
But it is at the cost of weakening Europe’s energy, as the project has created rifts between Europeans from the east and the west.
Just five years ago, Russia was able to enforce its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the wealthy, gas-intensive Western countries, whose deposits are nearing their end.
"This pipeline is part of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that organically connects us," Fillon said at the opening ceremony, demonstrating at what point large gas contracts are both political and economic.
All of this explains the broad smiles of Gazprom’s leaders present in large numbers in Lubmin, a gas supply site.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an important technical act.
The underwater pipe is made of steel with a concrete shell to protect it from the anchors of naval vessels.
It lies at the bottom of the sea at an average depth of 200 m.
During its construction, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to World War II.
“For security reasons, almost a hundred of them had to be removed or destroyed,” said Jens Müller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
Measures to protect fauna and flora had to be increased as well.
The pipe itself is a long metal hose weighing as much as 242 Eiffel Towers, which in its entire length is not interrupted by valves or maintenance stations.
One control platform was supposed to be built near Sweden, but the project manager rejected it when the Swedes were only unwilling to see the Russian state-owned company permanently settle off their coast.
“In the event of a failure, we will stop the gas flow in less than 1 minute,” explains Jens Müller.
In case of leakage, the gas contained in the gas pipeline leaks into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the builder, because the welds were designed to create a leak once every 100,000 years.
The state of the gas pipeline is controlled from the outside by an underwater robot pulled by a ship, while the inside of the gas pipeline is controlled by a device that circulates inside.
This cigar-shaped device with a diameter of 1 meter is inserted into the inside of the pipe and is pressed with gas.
In the target after three full days of travel at a speed of 3 m/s, it will provide accurate information about possible deformations of metal parts.
The long-distance gas pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without requiring the slightest repair.
The circulation of the gas is simply ensured by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar at the finish.
Five companies joined forces to implement this project.
Gazprom, which holds a 51% stake, remains in the lead.
It was joined by German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as Dutch company Gasunie and French group GDF Suez (9% each).
The five companies created a joint venture called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the pipeline.
The company is headquartered in the city of Zug in Switzerland, where taxation is extremely advantageous.
Gazprom subsequently leased the company all its gas transportation capacity for five years under a contract that could be renewed.
“Gazprom will benefit from the total capacity, whatever the amount of gas actually transported,” says Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the gas pipeline was provided by 30% shareholders and by 70% bank loans.
The total cost of work is expected to reach <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For the GDF Suez Group, the investment costs amounted to 240 million euros.
But minority shareholders are confident that their costs will be reimbursed, as only Gazprom takes the risk.
The pipeline exits from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on the sandy coast with pine forests.
The valves of 4.5 meters high form the outlet gate of the gas.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before it is transported to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine - brand notebook
The Italian company Moleskine, which was founded fifty years ago, wants to once again provide the joy of writing.
It brings the scent of adventure, hours spent writing under the light of a candle.
Moleskine’s notebook is easily recognizable by its black rectangular boards and its leaves of white color sent as obsolete over time.
Moleskine, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
Italian company Modo Modo based in Milan decides to launch a new design but distinguished notebook on the market at that time.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant working for the company, is in charge of launching a new product.
The notebook is inspired by the old production technique "moleskin" (imitation of the skin), which is used, for example, for the surface treatment of benches.
This type of notebook was highly appreciated by the writer and traveler.
“Moleskine brought back the old and forgotten object that was the icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century,” says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the brand’s head at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales rose by 26% to settle at 12.7 million units last year.
The situation is a distant secret production from the first years, when only 3,000 notebooks were made.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to compile any artificial portrait of the buyer, as the notebook will attract businessmen as well as students or professionals.
Moleskine’s image is that its owners are cosmopolitan, cultivated, and open-minded people.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its beginnings, now has almost a hundred and since 2008 has two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York.
He sends his notebooks to bookstores and through a chain of FNAC stores to small boutiques in city centers where he was able to enforce his identity.
“We have been following the spirit of the times and this need for new writing, through the turbulent development of emails,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of the Moleskine notebook: recently the brand opened the exhibition "Zach<0xC3><0xA1>zka", where architects or artists exhibit their notebook.
In August, on the occasion of the Locarno film festival, she also presented new notebook plates reminiscent of a leopard.
Moleskine benefits from its success and this cultural aura and diversifies its products: bags, diaries, pencils, laptop cases ... The brand is expanding to a range of carriers.
A success that aroused envy: in the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, which is writing a new page in Moleskine’s history.
Why is there such a high proportion of unemployed disabled workers?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
Today, the 15th week of employment for the disabled opens.
Despite the voluntary public policy introduced in 2005, the percentage of unemployed disabled people is still twice as high as the average, i.e. 19% compared to 9% for the entire population.
Is it depressing?
"No," said <0xC3><0x89>ric Blanchet, CEO of the Adapt Association, which organizes the Week for the Employment of the Disabled.
"The progress made in 15 years is remarkable."
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice, but three times higher."
"However, there is still much to do."
It should be said that for the unemployed disabled persons, numerous obstacles remain before their entry to work.
These are elderly people: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have low qualifications: 80% do not have a graduation and of the 2.3 million university students, only 10,000 are disabled.
And finally - long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for the disabled compared to 38% on average.
In short, these are the criteria that make it particularly difficult to return to work and that represent the "core of the problem", according to Christian Grapino, CEO of the Tremplin Association, which was founded in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
So much for the objective brakes.
There remains unspoken, ways of thinking that are certainly evolving, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité association found that the managers surveyed had a "weak level of knowledge about disabled people" with an "excessive perception of people in wheelchairs and mental or mental disabilities".
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the target of employing 6% of disabled workers set out in the 1987 Act.
The last known figures, which date from 2008, indicate a state equal to 2.6%.
“We are now around 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, which is responsible for collecting fees from companies that do not comply with the law.
Evidence is the number of "financed" businesses, as well as the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, which fell from 59,000 culprits to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on businesses," explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also demonstrates real awareness, especially in large enterprises."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of enterprises with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared to 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "What luck"
Before the French team (Bleus), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens challenged on Tuesday evening (8:45 p.m.), they did not hide the pleasure that this friendly match would bring them.
We will not go so far as to write that there was a union between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other on the podium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard reconciled.
Five months after the angry gesture of his attacker in the match against Turkey, the Belgian coach spoke only words of praise to his player.
“I am very happy with Eden and his progress, even with the fact that he loves his country.”
"I want to move forward," assures the French player Lille.
As for the difference between his performances in club matches and the national team matches, "it's the same thing, it's justified."
"I've been in Lille all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I need to clean up my brand."
Hazard, investigated against Romania on Thursday night for this match against France, comes to the stadium in Saint-Denis to finally "light up".
The concept of “joy” cannot be ignored.
Play against Bleus, whom he has encouraged since the age of 7 and in their winning campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been a fan,” he says.
This necessarily contributes even more to the "special" character of this meeting.
All the more so, because "there are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) on the opposite side," he recalls.
"We crossed paths right away."
"To be able to play against them, that's just a pleasure!"
Leekens kindly recalled "pride".
"Proud" to win"struggle - holiday".
“It’s also a matter of pride to note that France has become a very high-level team again, just over a year after the trauma in the South African city of Knysna.”
"Laurent Blanc has done a great job," he sighed.
Although Belgium will be missing at the next European Championship, a technical footballer would like to see himself on a plane with the French in 2014 in the direction of... Brazil.
“Our little Belgians are going to be big,” he said.
"We're building something right now, the players are ambitious, they're healthy hungry."
"You'll realize that for the next game." Including against France.
Portugal is very self-confident
The Portuguese coach Paulo Bento starts with great optimism the barrage against Bosnia Bosnia (22h00) on Wednesday in Lisbon.
On the way there, both teams lacked realism.
"At the end of those 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and above all a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of doubt. The Portuguese national football team, which has been at the helm since 2010, qualifies for Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually 90 minutes away from happiness.
There is only one match left and one opponent - Bosnia.
With Friday’s score (0-0) in Bosnia’s Zenica hell, it seems clear that nothing has been won.
Portugal certainly had more than an hour of dominance, but it was not able to score such a rare goal that would relieve him.
"It's a good result, but it's risky because we didn't score outside."
But at home at their amazing Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will step forward in front of an audience that should create a boiler there, even if the match definitely seems to be "very balanced," says the optimist, but with a sharp minded Bento.
"We expect a very balanced match, but we are absolutely convinced that we can have the upper hand," said the 24-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012," Queiroz said.
The indecisive match on Friday in Bosnia forces Portugal to score and win.
An indecisive match may suffice for Bosnians who also need to score goals.
"It's a good result, but it's risky because we didn't score outside," Bento said.
"We will play against a team that has great technical qualities and that has players with great individual qualities," he added.
Like in Zenica, the Portuguese will be interested in developing maximum pressure on the Bosnian team right from the start so that "they do not have time to think."
A good idea, provided it turns out to be realistic this time.
