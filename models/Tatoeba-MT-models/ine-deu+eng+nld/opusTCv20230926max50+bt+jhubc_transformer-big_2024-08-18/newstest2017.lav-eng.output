28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco supermarket
This week, a 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco has been found dead in a stairwell.
But the victim's brother says that he can't imagine anyone who would want to kill his brother, stating that: "His life has finally begun to improve."
The body, found Wednesday at a Westfield supermarket, has been identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, a San Francisco court medical expert said.
San Francisco police said his death was acquitted of murder and an investigation is underway.
Victim's brother Luis Galicia tells ABC's KGO that Frank had previously worked as a chef in Boston, but six months ago he went to his dream job at the restaurant "Sons & Daughters" in San Francisco.
A representative of the restaurant "Sons & Daughters" informs that the news of his death shocked and shocked them.
“We are a small team that works as a united family and we will miss him very much,” he said.
In this difficult time, we think we are together with Frank's friends and family.
Louis Galicia tells us that at the beginning, Frank had stayed in hostels, but lately, life has finally improved.
"He gathered in a new apartment and met a girl," Luis tells KGO radio station.
Luis Galicia claims that he doesn't know who would want to kill his younger brother.
He was a good man with a wide heart.
"He always spoiled his family by making a delicious meal and cooking lunches," said Luis Galicia.
He never wanted to get involved in a fight.
He was the brother who was adapting to the others.
"Given everything that went wrong in the world, he was like a raw diamond that shone brightly every day," he says.
Anyone who has information about what happened is invited to call SFPD Information Phone 415-575-4444.
Young doctors strike: calls for new protests
Representatives of young doctors are asking their trade unions to start protests in a dispute over the new contract.
The British Medical Association’s (LMA) Young Physicians Committee (JAC) is set to seek advice to support broader protests in early September.
HOW do you think that the ministers have not been able to dispel doubts about the agreement?
In July, young doctors and medical students rejected the contract proposed by the LMA.
58% of all members who took part in the vote voted against the contract.
In a message posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, JAK Council member Ellen McCort said that the government is still silent on the issue and therefore the offer of the contract has been rejected.
She said: "Given that, as a result of the vote, the contract offer has been completely rejected and a decision has been taken to call for new formal negotiations to discuss the most important issues."
In response to the government’s silence, JAK today formally requested a meeting with the LMA Council to authorize the development of new contracts, which will enter into force in September.
As a result of the dispute, the new doctors took part in six strikes, including the first time in the history of the NHS they stopped work.
Following a vote rejecting the terms of the contract proposed by the LMA and recommended by the BMA, Dr. Johans Malawan, the representative of the new doctors of the LMA, resigned.
Before meeting with 54,000 young doctors and medical students, he had told BMA members that the offer was good and would be accepted.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt informed that the contract would be concluded with English doctors.
Russia and Turkey: Rejected alliances?
A gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to stand down and announce the end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin congratulated the Turkish leader at the St. Petersburg Palace, it seemed that Ankara needed this partnership more.
However, they both collapsed.
Vladimir Putin's smile looked sloppy and did not provoke warm emotions, even in view of his usual abstinence.
In contrast, Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an has called Putin his "dear friend" at least five times, according to a review of the meeting.
I'm confused about the number.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only improve to the pre-crisis level, but become even stronger.
The next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan had acted as if nothing had happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm causes conflicting feelings.
But Putin’s radiant coolness shows that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
The first thing he mentioned in his speech was the landing of a Russian plane on the Syrian border.
At that time, Moscow reacted sharply.
Putin accused Ankara of stabbing a donkey in the back of Moscow.
The transformation was even more painful, given that it came from a friend.
Restoring true trust will be very difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Since November, the public position of Russia has changed.
For several months, government-controlled television has been spreading aggressive insults against Ankara.
All of a sudden, the Turks seemed to be at fault.
The most serious were the accusations that the Erdogan family itself profited from the illegal oil trade with the Islamic State-controlled part of Syria.
He himself, of course, denied it.
However, the key message of the St. Petersburg meeting is that it is time to forget the past.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received President Erdogan’s apology.
Russia could see it as a kind of victory.
Ankara's benefit from the peace settlement is obvious.
First of all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after the failed coup last month in which he was tried to get away.
Countless terrorist attacks have also shaken up his position.
There are also economic motives.
Russia's sanctions have caused substantial losses, especially the ban on charters, which usually ensures an influx of several million Russian tourists to resorts in Turkey every year.
The number of tourists decreased by almost 90%.
Also, Russian tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when regular flights will be resumed.
They hope for a holiday fever in the Mediterranean in the sound of the season.
As early as this week, national TV expects lower prices for fruits and vegetables as Turkish imports of fruits and vegetables will resume.
As the local newspaper Vedomosti quotes: "Tourists for them, tomatoes for us."
But the visit also had other political motives on the part of Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for, in their opinion, weakening its response to the attempted coup.
All of this can also be seen in the dissatisfaction with the lengthy negotiations on EU-Putin meddling, who is willing to take advantage of the situation of Turkey's estrangement from the West.
The Russian leader has undoubtedly gained extra points in Ankara's eyes, expressing support for its elected government after the coup attempt.
Note that Moscow understands this well, because it is deeply rooted in the fears of regime change in the country.
The summit, which took place in this luxurious seaside castle, gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present, as it was called by an analyst, the "rejected alliance", the two countries that feel alienated from the West are joining forces.
However, despite the unanimity publicly demonstrated, there are still significant differences of opinion between the two countries.
The main disagreements concern Syria, where Russia presents itself as a carrier of peace, but in fact Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
After more than three hours of initial negotiations, the two presidents announced at a press conference that they had not discussed the issue, unwilling to disclose the information.
The Turkish President has deliberately avoided issues of disagreement between the two countries, while President Putin wanted to highlight them.
There is no clear consensus on how the two countries could find a common language on the issue of Syria.
However, after months of openly hostile relations and potential disasters, when NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian fighter plane, the situation has improved as the two leaders have at least resumed negotiations.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland
SKB will continue to play a supporting role for the brand, the bank’s CEO said.
Outside of Scotland, SKB will no longer be available.
Ross Makevan tells BBC Scotland that the SKB brand was associated with the bank’s ambitions on a global scale.
It has renounced these ambitions because eight years ago the bank almost went bankrupt and needed financial assistance.
In the meantime, brand strategy experts have used the SKB brand to protect other consumer financial brands.
The bank has received millions of pounds from international sports sponsors, ranging from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon tennis champion Andy Murray.
But now it is decided to put other national brands at the forefront.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be available to Scottish customers, but it will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all SKB references, outside the main office and the official stock exchange list, will be replaced by the name NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Smaller private financial brands such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank will now also be noticed.
Makevans was interviewed during the trip with clients and employees along Invernessshire.
He told BBC Scotland: "SKB will become our investor brand and one that our employees work with because now we are becoming more of a brand bank."
With time, the bank itself became a global brand and SKB became a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have global ambitions, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in their industry and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
SKB has already announced that it will not continue sponsoring the Six Nations and will involve various brands in sponsoring the sport.
"The time has come to become a brand bank, because we have long asked ourselves how to become a better bank for our customers?" says the CEO.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical if we had announced that we would be a great bank for our customers and develop these brands.
But thanks to hard work and focusing on customer needs, not our own, we have obviously made a big difference.
We can revive these brands again, so I think now is the right time.
Frankijs Detori celebrates his 3,000th victory by taking first place in the Newmarket with a horse Predilection
Detori rebounds with his 3,000th win, finishing twice in the first race of the New Marquet.
On Friday, Jockey Frankie Detori won his 3,000th victory in British history, taking first place in the Newmarket.
He achieved this by celebrating his second victory in these races, which took place in his hometown, riding with Predilection, trained by John Gosden.
45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey who has achieved such results in horse sprint races.
He has joined Ser Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Pigot, Pete Eder and Willie Carson.
The three-time champion jockey Detori, who had previously won with the horse Ghayyar, said: "This is something special."
I am very moved because my family is here.
I am very happy that this happened in Newmarket, because I have been living here for 30 years.
This is not a big race, this is not the Royal Ascot, but an ordinary Friday night with 20,000 people.
I feel relieved and very grateful.
After the victory, Detori and Predilection are greeted with applause and cheers.
Two jockeys have reached this record in races with obstacles - champion Richard Johnson and career-ending 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who has set several records in his career, surpassing more than 4,300 wins.
Lester Pigot, the nine-time derby winner, won 4493 in his career.
Frankie is one of today's best jockeys and it's no surprise that he has achieved successes that only a few can achieve.
He is stylish and strong, but his tactical sense sets him apart from other jockeys.
He is a fantastic representative of racing, his enthusiasm and charisma for years attracts fans of this sport.
A few weeks ago at the Epsom race, I told Frank that he would have won 6,000 if I hadn’t participated in just the weekends and the big races.
But seriously, it’s a real pleasure that Frankie has been winning the UK races on a regular basis for 30 years.
He is a life-happy man who is very useful in British racing, and he is also an excellent hockey player.
Frank Detori marked this achievement with his trademark - the flying saucer.
From wind speed finishes to a flying crash, Frankie Detori has been the face of British horse racing for twenty years.
This has been an adventure-filled journey.
He has won countless major races, including the famous 1996 "Great Seven" in Ascot, in addition to surviving an airplane crash and disqualification for the use of preparations.
Three years ago, it was difficult for him to return after a six-month disqualification, but he demonstrated his strength of character by challenging those who questioned him by returning to his best form.
And he could take part in the race for a while more - Detori has previously said that he would continue to participate in the race at least until the age of 50.
Russian President Putin dismisses Sergei Ivanov, the head of the administration
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly fired the head of the administration Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov for many years was in the circle of Putin's closest people.
At present, a 63-year-old politician has been appointed as a special representative in nature and transport.
The Kremlin said in a statement that Putin "decided to release Ivanov from the duties of the head of the Russian presidential administration", without giving a reason.
Anton Vaino, who has been his deputy since 2012, has been appointed in Ivanov's place.
44-year-old Vaino is a failed diplomat.
Vaino was born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MVSAI) and later worked in the Embassy of Tokyo.
As reported by the Kremlin website (in Russian), he later headed the administration of the President's protocol and government officials.
After his appointment, he told Putin: "Thank you for your loyalty."
In my opinion, the main task of the administration is to support your work in the office of the President of the State, drafting laws and controlling the execution of your decisions.
Putin told a Russian broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov himself wanted to step down and recommended Vaino as his replacement.
Do smiles convince?
This move has enthralled Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov is Vladimir Putin’s close ally and, like Putin, worked for the Soviet Security Service in the Soviet Union.
In this position, he was one of the most influential men in Russia.
In a meeting broadcast on national television, the two men announced that Ivanovs resigned from his post on his own initiative.
But in spite of the smiles on the cameras, which this explanation rarely convinces, especially before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the outcome associated with the struggle for power?
No one knows that.
However, the official statement that the man, who was considered a possible president, suddenly wanted to become the head of Russian environmental policy, is perceived with great skepticism.
In the remarks published on the Kremlin website, Ivanov tells Putin: "It is a fact that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to entrust me with this complicated post, I might even say, a problematic post, for four years.
It turns out that I have been in this position for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took up his position in December 2011.
Previously, he was Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former employee of the VDK State Security Service, just like Putin.
In the late 1990s, Putin headed the Federal Security Service, which is the successor of the VDK, Ivanov took the post of his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusted the most.
At the end of Putin’s second term, Ivanov was seen as a potential candidate for the Russian president, as Putin’s re-election to a third term would be unconstitutional.
But then another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev, became president.
Putin became prime minister, and three and a half years later he returned to the presidency.
The appearance of minced fish in a garden in the city of Banff
A man from Banff asks for help to find out the circumstances of what species of fish appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bein thinks that 75 fish could be sand owls who have retired from the aqueduct.
Mr Beina, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted a video of the fish on the Periscope website, hoping that someone might know how these 5 centimeters large fish got into his garden.
The crossroads of the Quincy Sphere: the bridge is now connected to Faifa.
Currently, the <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern part of the Quincy Crossing to the viaduct, which means the bridge is now connected to Faif.
The first of the four connecting parts is completed, which means that the construction of the bridge is nearing completion.
The construction of the Faifa bridge is 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It consists of 10 000 tonnes of steel, 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 support cables.
Currently, the <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Economics Secretary Kate Brown had arrived at the construction site today and was one of the first to climb the bridge.
He said, "This is a symbolic and historic moment in the construction of the Quincy Bridge."
In this project, we see an unparalleled engineering solution where more than 30,000 tons of cement and steel have been used in the construction of this part alone.
Despite the enormous weight and size of the bridge, connecting the bridge and the viaduct is an extremely delicate process that requires enormous precision.
Overall, more than 79% of the bridge deck has already been built and the last stage connecting the bridge to Rosita will be laid today, meaning all parts of the bridge are ready for laying.
Michael Martin, director of the fourth bridge connection project, says: "The first connection is a very important point in the construction of any bridge."
In this fantastic project, the first connection demonstrates top-class engineering construction.
After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the support of the northern tower, we were left to connect the northern section of the road with the part of the land or viaduct.
This was done by shifting the section of the northern viaduct 700 millimetres to the south.
It was a huge and at the same time very delicate operation.
Huge, because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6000 tons and had to be pulled in a slope of about 3%.
Delicate, because the tolerance in both directions that the team worked with was only a few millimeters.
Thankfully, everything went well.
Simona Bailsa wins gold in women's gymnastics.
Forget the tensions.
Forget the excitement.
Simon Bails is not worried about this.
Dynamic jumps.
Effortlessly performs exercises on the log.
Unmatched on the floor.
Absolutely impeccable.
And finally, the Olympic champion.
On Thursday, a 19-year-old American athlete won a gold medal, fully demonstrating the difference between herself and the rest of the world on the Olympic stage.
Her total score of 62,198 was the head of the court superior to the result of the silver medal winner and her teammate Alija Raisman and the bronze medal winner of the Russian athlete Alija Mustafina.
On Thursday, Simona Bailsa, an American athlete, performed an exercise exercise on the individual multi-battle women’s pole gymnastics final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Fears became the fourth consecutive American to win the title of multi-battle champion and the fifth best gymnast, gradually strengthening his reputation as the best gymnast of his generation and perhaps the best gymnast in history.
When the final result was announced, she burst into tears as the long way to this moment was over.
This achievement places him next to such unrivalled athletes as Michael Phelps, who has taken his sport to another level.
For the last three years, Bail has dominated its sporting form, winning 15 medals at world championships, including 10 gold medals, performing such outstanding, precise and ambitious combinations of exercises that she was named the winner of the 1984 Summer Olympics by Mary Louise Retonne, who rewrote her for "the name of the winner".
In Brazil, she was faced with the final test, where she had to compete to a large extent with the expectations placed on her, rather than with the other athletes.
She would be disappointed if she returned to her home in Spring, Texas with no gold medals.
US athletes Simona Bailsa (left) and Alija Raismane are scouting for the respective gold and silver medals in the women’s individual multi-struggle final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
The first gold medal was won by Bailsa on Tuesday, making a special farewell party of the selection coordinator Marta Karolji.
While Bails claims that she hadn’t expected anything like this in her long journey to the heights of fame, it’s not true.
Part of her performance in free movement, which includes her special acrobatic transition, is accompanied by Latin music, which fits perfectly on the street next to the Rio Olympic Games arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl, adopted by her grandparents when she was a baby and discovered by coach Amy Burman’s mother on a trip to the gym, where Burman’s turtles took place, has now become a force to be reckoned with.
She has not lost in multi-battle competitions since the summer of 2013, and the winning series can continue as long as Bailsa wants.
While Mustafina was a little ahead in the lead during the two rotations, it was just an illusion.
Balancing beam and free movement - part of the race, where Bails will defend his championship title, is still just ahead.
She led the way with a score of 15,433 on the log and strengthened the lead with a score of 15,933 in free movements.
Raismane gently hugged her while they were waiting for the results, which was just a formality and she poured tears of joy when the dream she had once recorded in her notebook came true.
Raisman's result was as a small revenge for the events four years ago when she shared third place with Mustafa, but lost the battle for the bronze medal.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, whom the Americans call the "grandmother", stood out in a convincing leadership.
After performing in free movements, which sparked doubts about her return, she was able to devote an air kiss to the crowd.
While the 19-year-old Bails viral Twitter post r, which she posted this week, now has a completely different meaning.
Six-year-old Mahay Brown survives a gunfight in Philadelphia.
Police say a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, indicating that he is already the second six-year-old to be shot this week in Philadelphia.
The child's grandparents confirmed to the CBS Philadelphia news channel that it was Mahay Brown.
Elders say that Brown was shot several times, including in the groin, leg, arm, and abdomen, but was still unconscious when he was taken to the hospital.
His grandmother, Delores Melendez, told TV: "His little body was simply rotten with vines."
I can't believe it.
The boy is in a critical condition and has already undergone several surgeries.
The family informs that he will definitely recover.
He had to start going to the first grade of the local elementary school.
Brown is one of four people killed in a part of the city of Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man.
CBS Philadelphia reports that one of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition, while the other two victims are in stable condition.
The channel reports that the child was found in the front seat of the car next to the 29-year-old victim in critical condition.
The other two victims were not found in the car and police are investigating whether any of them had been the attacker.
The investigator told CBS Philadelphia that a number of gunmen were likely involved in the shooting.
At the site of the event found gun cartridge shells belonging to various weapons.
Looks like it's been a long shot.
There are shells on both sides of the pedestrian enclosure.
“So it looks like there were a number of armed gunmen here who were actively involved in the shooting,” says Philadelphia Police Captain Antonis Ginaldi.
Injuries have also been made to several houses and cars.
No one has yet been arrested and it is reported that the police are checking the surveillance camera footage.
On Tuesday, during the shooting, a bullet hit a 6-year-old girl while she was playing in front of her home in the Westlake area.
She's slowly recovering, but the police are still looking for the culprit.
Why do we need Simon, Gaby, and Laurie?
I call it the Women's Olympic Lightweight Team of the Year for a number of reasons.
Firstly, I have been to all the Summer Olympics since 1984, and the US team has never been so good.
Secondly, this team has three athletics, Simon Bails, Gaby Duglas and Laurie Hernandez, which are inspired by many young girls.
People can be proud that this team also includes Alija Raismane, who is a Jewess, and Madison Cociana, who is a Catholic.
Finally, this team truly represents America.
It has also strengthened the participation of black and Latin American athletes in this sport.
For the past four years, the best gymnast is an American of African descent.
Last year, Simon and Gaby took 1st and 2nd place.
These are the impressive results.
In the previous Olympic Games, Gaby Duglas surprisingly became an Olympic champion, and America could be delighted.
Now the world has seen incredible exercises performed by three-time world champions Simon Bailes, Duglas and Laurie Hernandez, performing unprecedented but masterful exercises.
On Thursday, Simona became the fourth consecutive American to win a gold medal in the women's individual multiplayer.
Her teammate Alija Raismane won a silver medal.
We have seen the best that this sport can give, but the situation in the rest of the country during gymnastics is completely different.
Simona, Gaby and Laurie joined the Olympic team, as did Ali and Madison.
They are the "Olympic Five" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will be only four athletes, and this is coach Martha Carol's last year of coaching.
In fact, gymnastics is an expensive sport. Athletes mainly train in private athletic clubs, and they are supported by parents who pay for training, rooms, travel, formal dresses, hotels (for coaches, athletes and their families) and other expenses.
Most of these athletic clubs are located in urban areas that can afford this sport.
In these clubs, athletes conduct all their trainings, and this is an expensive and long-term investment for light-weight families.
Aimija Burman - Simona Bails coach and Megiya Hainija - Laura Hernandez coach have trained their athletes since the two girls started to practice athletics.
We need to provide new girls who are inspired by Simon, Gaby and Laurie with cheaper gymnastics training opportunities.
I founded my athletics organization 20 years ago.
My organization is based in Harlem, and we offer more than 15,000 city youth (mainly black and Spanish) gymnastics trainings for free or at a low price. We have also trained national and international champions.
In September, we will open a branch in Detroit (my hometown) to provide local youth with an opportunity to get to know this great sport.
Athletics develops coordination of strength, flexion and body, and also learns hard work, discipline and goal-setting.
This combination ensures a long life with good health and success both at school and at work.
This team will inspire thousands of young girls to train in athletics and it is fantastic.
To engage in this sport is very important, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thanks to Simona, Alija, Gabia and Madison for a great demonstration of the "Girls' Force", winning the Olympic Games gold medals and motivating countless new girls of different origins to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After the rejection of Jeremy Hunt's offer, the new doctors plan to expand more strikes.
Ministers hoped to put an end to the disagreement by reaching an agreement on changes to the contract with the representatives of the British Medical Association, but this was rejected by 58 percent of the 37 000 new doctors who took part in the vote.
In July, Hunt announced plans to close the contract, saying the NHS was in an unstable state and further delays would only harm employees and patients.
The first new doctors have already signed the new contract, which provides for changes to the conditions of work at night shifts and weekends to improve working conditions during non-standard working hours.
Yesterday evening, the BMA’s new doctor’s representative, Dr. Helen McCourt, said that the new doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially that it will deepen the labor crisis and it does not provide for equal conditions for all doctors.
There are eight weeks left until the first group of young doctors signs the new contract, so progress must be made, because there is not much time left.
BMA’s efforts to resolve the problem through negotiations have been confronted with the government’s reluctance to engage and sometimes with complete silence.
This is despite the fact that last month, Jeremy Hunt said that his door was always open.
Jeremy Hunt must act immediately, stop inactivity, and work with the new doctors.
If he does not, then the new doctors are ready for new protests.
During the last strike, more than 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 visits were postponed at the end of April, while nurses and consultants tried to replace doctors who had gone to picket.
Ministers hoped to end the dispute by reaching an agreement on changes to the agreement with representatives of the UK Medical Association.
The BMA wants to increase the rate of work on weekends for 54,000 new doctors who would be covered by the new contracts.
NHS Employment Executive Director Daniel Mortimer urged young doctors not to go on strike.
Mr Mortimer explains that the strikes do not solve anything, but only increase the pressure on the stressed workers and worry, create stress and obstacles for patients, caregivers and their families.
Over the last two months, we have spoken to the new medical committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions, have responded positively to their questions about caregivers and rapporteurs.
Employers expect that active cooperation in other important issues, such as the placement of employees, flexible training, in addition to training for those who return after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of training programs, leave of studies and non-payment of wages.
The drug for 2 pounds per day can reduce the risk of heart attack.
Thousands of patients who have had a heart attack could be treated with the drug for 2 pounds per day, as official representatives recommend using it for more people and for a longer period of time.
Ticagrelor reduces the risk of recurrent heart attacks in people with heart disease.
This medicine is already prescribed for use 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of recurrent heart attack.
NHS representative NICE recommends using this preparation 4 years after a heart attack to further reduce the risk of heart attack in people with cardiovascular problems.
However, NICE, which is currently in the NHS, recommends using this preparation 4 years after a heart attack to further reduce the risk of heart and blood vessels.
Every year, around 140,000 people in England suffer a heart attack, and a quarter of them suffer a recurrent heart attack or stroke.
Heart attack and stroke are caused by the accumulation of fat in the walls of the heart, forming clogs.
If the blockage breaks, it can create a clot, blocking the blood flow to the heart and causing a heart attack.
In turn, if the thrombus separates from the blood vessel wall, it can get further into the bloodstream and block blood access to the brain, causing a heart attack.
People who have had a heart attack are at greater risk of having a recurrent heart attack.
Ticagrelor, produced by the UK firm AstraZeneca and marketed under the name Brilique, reduces the risk of thrombus formation.
The new NICE guidelines, published today, recommend that people take 90 mg Ticagrelor for 12 months and another 3 years at 60 mg twice daily with aspirin.
Professor Carol Longson, Director of NICE Health Technology, explains: "Despite the availability of medicines to prevent recurrent heart attacks, more than a quarter of people who have had a heart attack experience another heart attack or stroke, which often has serious consequences."
Fears of a repeated heart attack can leave a negative impact on the quality of a person’s life.
Evidence shows that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of recurrent heart attack and heart attack in people who have experienced it before.
When provisionally recommending treatment with Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we can extend the treatment options to thousands of people who are thus benefiting.
In view of the limited information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor, in particular the risk of bleeding when taking this medicine for more than three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend its use for longer than this period.
The culture of political correctness promotes fraud during elections in Muslim communities
According to the management report, former mayor of Tauerhamlet, Lutfur Rahman, was dismissed from office in connection with corruption.
The government report reveals that political correctness is the result of a culture that is turning a blind eye to widespread fraud in Muslim communities.
Former Prime Minister Sir Eric Pickle criticizes police, election watchdogs and city councils for ignoring signs of fraud in the electoral process because they are "fearful of harming ethnic and religious interests."
The former community secretary, who has now become the head of an anti-corruption organization, says voter intimidation is so prevalent for religious reasons that police should be allowed to place guards at polling stations to protect intimidated voters.
He also recommends that voters should present a document proving their identity when they vote in order to prove their true identity.
Voters are currently required to indicate only their name and address.
He even recommends marking voters' fingers with a special ink to prevent double voting.
Reporters should also be given more protection, says Sir Eric.
He believes that the press should have greater access to Council documents and decisions taken by informal committees and working groups.
He says: "The goal is not only to prevent fraud in elections, but also to protect local governments from the wider culture of corruption and fraud that goes hand in hand with it."
The report was commissioned by Downing Street following the scandal surrounding the Tauerhamlet city elections.
Last year, a special election court decided to remove mayor Lutfur Rahman from the mayor's office because of corrupt and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman "cynically distorted" the religious views of his Muslim community and silenced his critics, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
"Rahman has led his election campaign with the view that it is the religious duty of Muslim believers to vote for him."
About 300 votes were forged or questionable because one person had voted several times.
Sir Eric also points out that there are signs of fraud throughout the country.
He pointed out that it is particularly worrying to vote by mail, where senior members of Muslim communities have forced others to vote for their preferred candidates.
Sir Eric recommended a series of measures to improve the electoral system, including the presentation of a document certifying the identity of the person.
His report states: "Evidence shows that vulnerable members of ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, are being forced to vote for the community's oldest elected candidates, particularly in the Bangladeshi and Pakistani communities."
"There are concerns that the regional authorities do not pay attention to these problems because of political correctness, as it could affect ethnic and religious interests."
Sir Eric has set out 50 recommendations on how to improve the electoral system, which also includes a ban on political activists from acting with mailed votes to prevent "vote collection".
The report, which is being examined by Theresa May, also calls for a more thorough check of registration to prevent the use of voter lists for fraud in the area of immigration and benefits.
Consider asking voters to present a proof of identity before the vote.
Mark the fingers of the voting voters with a special ink to prevent double voting.
Systematically check the nationality of the persons to make sure that the person has the right to vote.
To set a three-year limitation on requests for automatic voting by mail.
Prohibit political campaigners and activists from voting by mail and voting envelopes by mail.
Provide the police with the power to deploy guards at polling stations.
To make changes to the law to make it easier for persons to be held liable for intimidation in accordance with the Human Rights Act of 1983.
Prohibit photographing in polling stations.
Determine the requirement to use only English in polling stations (except in Wales).
Strengthen training so that the staff of the constituencies ensure that voters go to the polls one by one.
Sir Eric sharply criticizes the Metropolitan Police, noting that no charges have been brought in the Tauerhamlet case.
He says: "The Electoral Court only disqualified Lufturu Rahman and his representative for activities related to corruption and fraud."
He was conclusively found guilty on the standard of evidence of criminal law, based on infallible evidence.
He also criticises the ineffective "cache check" of city council voters in the electoral registration districts.
Sir Eric notes: "Last year's court decision was a wake-up call.
Our country is known as the homeland of Parliament, but the alarming and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the appearance of the authorities that fraud does not endanger this good reputation.
Infatuation with a cyclist - Kate's Companion and Other Rio Olympic Celebrities
Fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics are excited about the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand Prevote, who fans have recognized as extremely similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
However, the 24-year-old cyclist is not the only athlete who fights for gold this summer, who, as the media writes, prides himself on his celebrity companion.
Therefore, in honor of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces that are currently visible on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympic Games participants, which is very similar to the stars of Hollywood.
Hunter and wolf: Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. archery team, is on the left, compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood
With the exception of Kate's fellow cyclists, many people on the internet point out that this archer could be the twin brother of superstar Leonardo Di Kaprio.
Brady Elison, a member of the U.S. men's archery team, caused a storm on Twitter when photos were published of him very much like the Wolf of Wall Street.
The athlete himself noticed the storm on social media and admitted that he had been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood.
"I personally don't see much resemblance except for a beard," Brady tells the Huffington Post.
"He's a good looking <0xC4><0x8D>alis, so I take that as a compliment."
This year, one of the most popular pairs of fellow London 2012 Olympic champions will undoubtedly gain even more popularity: the striking similarity between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neal Patrick Harris.
Russian athlete Ali Mustafina, thanks to his large, expressive eyes, is compared to the Cuban American singer Gloria Estefan.

Women: Football star (left) Hope Solo and actress Jennifer Carpenter's series "Dexters" (right) have a similar face shape and eyes.
There is not one: some Twitter user was pleasantly surprised to learn that others also see these similarities
Theory: This user believes that there may be a reason why the two look so similar
Recently, a Twitter user said with real joy that "the rest of the internet users would agree that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter actually look identical."
The US football star and the actress of the series "Dexters" really have a very similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons refer to Carrie Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linnya. Also, the gold medallist Gabi Duglas prides himself on a beautiful, wide smile, which resembles the "Bring On" of a
CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for his comment that the Chinese swimmer was 'finished like a pig'.
Bairon Macdonald’s analysis of the 14-year-old Ai Yanha’s fourth place finish in the women’s 4x200 m freestyle relay caused a storm of outrage among CBC viewers.
The Canadian channel CBC was forced to apologise because one of its commentators commented that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer from a race was "flying out of a race that smelled alone" and "ending up like a pig".
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was turned off when 4x200 m freestyle relays for women at the end of the final presented their personal opinion .
MacDonald, who was included in the CBC commentator team to give life to the comments, said: "This little fourteen-year-old girl from China can't keep up with it."
"Then she ran away from the race, sniffing herself and ending up like a pig."
Thank you very much!
Ai Yanhana, a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer, scored 1:57.79 in the second leg, which is 1.61 seconds slower than the result of the Canadian, Delors Ruckas, allowing the Canadians to reach China.
Viewers across Canada reacted immediately on the Internet because they were shocked to hear such tones and utterances.
Emmett McFarlane tweeted: "Did a CBC commentator just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "ends up like a pig"????".
The idiot did not realize that they were still in the direct ether.
Ai Yanha of China's 4x200m freestyle final women were named as "the little fourteen-year-old from China who doesn't have a companion."
Criticism of Bairon Macdonald was quickly accepted, as many asked for explanations.
Twitter users couldn’t believe it when they heard Bairon MacDonald’s insensitive comments.
Twitter user Sarah Paradi wrote: "Oh, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and you make us all sound like racists. #contrary.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who was then CBC's head of live broadcasting, apologized for MacDonald's comments, saying, "We apologise that the comment on the swimming result was echoed in direct aether."
It was an unsuccessful choice of words and we are very sorry that it happened.
The CBC apologised to more than 90 people who had responded to this comment on Twitter.
MacDonald's colleague Scott Russell had to apologize for him.
The CBC then issued an apology to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about MacDonald’s comment.
Also, the channel quickly published an apology and a statement.
We are very sorry that such comments have been made and that they have come to the forefront.
Yesterday, we immediately responded and apologised to all viewers and followers of live broadcasts on social media.
For the sake of clarity, Bairon’s comments were made about the swimmer’s performance, not addressed to her personally.
However, they were in any case unprofessional and unsuccessfully chosen statements and Byron was very sorry for what had happened.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald personally apologized in the direct aether and tried to explain that he did not think that his comment would be perceived as a personal attack.
At the CBC Olympics, he said: "I would like to take a moment and apologize for the comment I made yesterday after the women's freestyle competition."
I'm talking about the swimmer's performance, not her in person.
Needless to say, I did not intend to show disrespect and I am really very sorry that it happened.
Primark buyers are shocked by a woman who shamelessly hangs out in the middle of a lingerie store.
The buyers felt uncomfortable when the woman began to undress in order to keep panties in the middle of the store.
Further aggravating the situation, she held them up to make sure they adhered to her and then pulled them off, putting panties back on the store shelf.
She continued to look for clothes in the Folkestone Bouverie Place shopping mall store and held four more panties.
Primark store in the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone – the place where this woman held her underwear and then put it back on the shelf.
At the time, there was also a mother of two children, Jennie Davidson, who told me that the unknown woman put on her clothes after wearing her underwear and left the store without buying anything.
She points out that people couldn’t believe their eyes.
Standing in the middle of the store, she took her panties off the shelf, pulled off her panties and panties and cut them on the spot.
She didn’t even try to find a more discreet place to measure them, she just held them there on the spot.
Everyone watched her pull out her panties and apparently the woman didn't like them, because she just put them back on the shelf.
She measured three more panties until she decided that she didn’t like any of them and left the store.
She didn’t seem to be worried that anyone was watching or thinking of someone who would buy the clothes she was wearing.
Mrs. Davidson, 33, from Kent, says: "The idea is that someone is going to buy clothes that have been worn by another person and that have not been washed afterwards."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms Davidson adds: "I assume that after she left the store, the store staff removed these clothes from the store shelves - which is also acceptable."
I cannot imagine that I could buy new underwear and find out that another woman has kept them and then they are not washed.
The Primark representative stated that Primark was aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday, 9 August.
The specific clothes are removed from the shelves of the store.
How to protect yourself from firearms using Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer.
To find out how to protect yourself in the near distance from attackers with a firearm, we spoke with Krav Maga Grandmaster from New York Ron Mizraki.
Whether you are attacked from the front or the back, this video shows how to protect yourself and gain control over the attacker.
Mizraki indicates that if the attacker attacks from the back, then first it is necessary to turn to clearly see the attacker and avoid the trajectory of the shot.
Then the weapon must be held between your front arm and shoulder and make a blow in the face of the opponent with your free elbows.
Then follow the shot with a path through the circle and while the attacker is in pain, it is necessary to take away his weapon, step over his face with a weapon spade and step back, continuing to point the weapon at him.
If the attacker approaches from the front, the situation is similar - avoid the trajectory of the shot, close the weapon and disengage it so that the villain can not shoot.
At the same time, you must put pressure on the weapon and make a blow to the opponent's chest and finally take away his weapon and step back, continuing to point at him.
Does it sound complicated?
Watch the video to see how exactly Mizraki does it.
But remember, if you are not a Krav Maga master, then it is safer to give back your money to the thief.
The Vandal family demolishes the social house of Salta<0xC5><0xA1>a Kornvola and is exhibited on the street.
The Vandal family has been expelled from their home for terrorizing their neighbors, causing damage to their social home in the amount of 50,000 pounds.
Tanya Skeldona and her partner Sean Trebilcox are badly injured from the property in Saltash Cornwall because of a number of complaints about them.
When they were forcibly removed from the property, shocked housing service representatives found that the property was completely demolished.
There were holes in the floors and walls, garbage was dumped everywhere, and the walls were covered with graffiti.
The family is now dispossessed of the property and most likely lives in a private property.
Donna Makevoya, the manager of Cornwall Housing Service, says there are concerns that the house will not be able to be restored.
She says that for the people who lived here, it was extremely difficult and she believes that people can not live it.
In this case, several factors must be considered, as this property in Cornwall will not have a good reputation in the future.
This family is famous and their name is well known.
The couple had three sons who were periodically in possession, and police say their terror turned out to be violence, walking on the street with baseball bats, intimidation of locals, drug use, drug sales, and loud gossip and libel.
47-year-old Skeldona, on whose behalf the property was owned, was sentenced in June for anti-social behaviour.
Waste landfills have been found in several rooms of the demolished house.
In the house, where drugs were previously marketed, several floorboards have also been excavated.
Neighbors say that they regularly went to the street and were constantly called the police.
The Cornwall Housing Service forcibly removed them from the property when they had been given 11 weeks to leave the house voluntarily.
The desperate neighbors were very happy about the display, because their life had been an absolute hell.
One said, "They didn't care about other citizens."
We lived next to them for 20 years, it has always been crazy.
It's amazing how often we've seen the police here.
We couldn't lie down this morning.
We woke up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!
Now that they are finally gone, here will be wonderful.
Adam Fitzpatrick, who is the head of Cornwall Housing Service Neighbourhood Protection, said the family did not cooperate with local security authorities.
The family has lived here for 20 years and is regularly called the police.
A variety of old and unusable items were found in the home-grown garden.
He also said: "It is very unfortunate that the tenants did not show any responsibility for their behavior, because leaving the house is always the last step that the Cornwall Housing Service is considering."
This was a very difficult case because their behaviour was extreme and it was very difficult for their neighbours to observe their behaviour.
I appreciate the work that my entire team, the police of Devon and Cornwall and the members of the community have invested in this case, who have been courageous and have cooperated with us in providing the necessary information.
I hope that this event will make life easier for our neighbours and show that anti-social behaviour is unacceptable.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons lived here at different times, but they were all about 20 years old.
Dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the rooms after laying.
The staff will now have to clean up the pile of waste left in the house.
In 2014, the police carried out a search and found more than 70 grams of marijuana, weights, accessories and 1,700 pounds of cash.
Skeldone has only been found guilty of storing Class B drugs for the purpose of distributing them.
She insisted the money was meant to be a memorial to her son Lee Sheldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After the exhibition, it became known that they are currently renting a private property in Plymouth.
Many of the walls of the house were painted with graffiti.
Police say they will continue to expose tenants who violate their leases.
Devon and Cornwall Police Spokesperson Angel Krove points out that this display is a clear warning to other tenants who continue to break the rules.
She also said that: "This is a warning to those who believe that they can behave as they want and there will be no consequences."
The Devon and Kronwall police are not accepting criminal and anti-social behaviour, and the police will continue to work with our partners to protect local communities.
Willingness to spend can give an impetus to the economy.

The mayor of Canu has banned burkini swimsuits on the beaches.
The mayor of the French southern resort town of Cannes has banned wearing burkini swimwear on the beaches of the city, which almost completely covers the woman's body and is very reminiscent of a swimsuit, local officials said on Thursday.
The mayor of Cannes, David Linar, has signed an order that "access to beaches and swimming is prohibited to anyone who does not have a swimsuit that respects good customs and secularism" as a fundamental principle of the French Republic.
"Beach dress, which extrinsically shows religious affiliation at a time when France and places of worship are the target of terrorist attacks, can pose a risk of disruption of public order (collision, clashes, etc.) that needs to be prevented," the order said.
"We are not talking about a ban on wearing religious symbols on the beach, but about outer clothing that is linked to the trust of terrorist movements that are at war with us," said Thierry Miguls, head of municipal services.
He added that burkini swimsuits have not been seen on the beaches of Cannes since 28 July, when a member of the right-wing central party "Republicans" Linars signed this order and it entered into force.
This week, the water park in the city of Marseilles canceled a planned private event for Muslim women who were wearing burqins in swimsuits, as outrage over such an event was expressed by both right and left-wing politicians.
In France, it is forbidden to wear face coverings for Muslim women, but it is not prohibited to wear religious symbols or appropriate clothing.
On 14 July, 85 people were killed in a terrorist attack in the nearby resort town of Cannes, for which the Islamic State group took responsibility.
On July 26, two assailants, who had sworn allegiance to the Islamic State, brutally murdered priests in a church in the north-west of France.

This year, as in other years, the main task of the company is to continue to increase both turnover and profit.
In the meantime, it is recommended to leave the profits made last year undivided.

The festival "Cuba" begins in Lucavsala.
On Thursday, 11 August, in the evening of Lucavsala was given the start of one of the last festivals of this summer - there until Sunday night will be held "Cuba".
In the first evening, bands such as "Enter Shikari" from the UK, which was expected last year, but did not leave the program, American punks "NOFX", DJ Maxim from the group "The Prodigy" and others disappeared.
Also in the next days of the festival, the program has the noteworthy words - "Guano Apes" and "Garbage" of the pilgrimage of the "Ramones" pilgrimage of the pancrocus legend Marcy Ramone with "Marky Ramone's Blitzkrieg", "Brutto&Lyapis" with the leaders of the Belarusian pancrocus in the pilgrimage of Sergey
This is the second year that the "Cuban" festival takes place in Latvia.
Last year, it suffered financial failure and huge losses. But it did not stop the organizers from trying again - they added a longitude to the name, included in the program also some Latvian group (on Friday evening at 19:15 on the stage climb "All Day Long") and announced that the festivities were held there.
Whether these efforts will be justified, it is still too early to judge, because the festival only started, but, as the first evening observed by "Delfi Entertainment", at least for the time being huge efforts of people have failed to attract and the number of visitors was similar to last year.
The British trek cycling team twice set the Olympic record and won the sprint.
The British trek team on Thursday twice corrected the Olympic record and won the sprint in men's competitions.
The first Olympic record was corrected by the British in qualifying, but in the first round of the race it was again corrected by the New Zealanders.

The final British team won with a result of 42,440 seconds, beating the New Zealanders by 0.102 seconds.
In the battle for bronze, the French team defeated Australia.
It should be added that the record was also corrected in the women's qualifying round - the UK team corrected the world record, which is now 4:13,260.
The President who remained in the shadow: Gustav Zemgale - 145.
On Friday, August 12, the 145th anniversary of the birth of the second President of Latvia, Gustavs Zemgals, is celebrated.
Zemgals proclaimed the state of Latvia, but it is not deserved to be left in the shadow of the widely described first President of Latvia, J<0xC4><0x81>nis <0xC4><0x8C>akstes, and the last President of the pre-war period, K<0xC4><0x81>rlis Ulmanis.
None of our citizens has defended democracy and the rule of law as much as Zemgals, Arnolds Auzi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> writes in the book dedicated to Gustav Zemgals published ten years ago.
In conversation with the portal "Delfi" Auzins emphasizes that Zemgale is one of the few high-ranking politicians who had a sense of humor.
The rest are so rigid, always very correct.
He taught not to be like that, today it could be similar to what Raimonds Windon is.
"He was one who was close to the people," says Auzi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>.
Modern politicians know history poorly, they referred to K<0xC4><0x81>rli Ulmani as a good leader, but rarely does anyone know how naughty he was.
The only person to whom he had not been yelling was General Balodis.
Even if in the pictures he is kind and smiling, by nature he was hysterical.
"Zemgals with his sense of humor and democracy leaves the opposite impression," says Auzi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>.
Professor Aivars Stranga of the Faculty of History and Philosophy of the University of Latvia in a conversation with "Delfi" agrees with Auzi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>'s assessment of Zemgale as a calm and well-balanced statesman.
He also notes that Zemgale stood out with respect for minorities, regularly invited Jewish representatives to the presidential palace.
"At that time, it was not a normal course of action, after the Zemgale Presidency Albert Kviesis took over this tradition," the historian says.
He was such a quiet and well-meaning man who had to be persuaded to become president for a long time.
He didn't like it, he just didn't eat fame.
He was also quite critical of himself because he did not know the French language, but he felt that the president should definitely understand it.
"During the presidency, the basics of the French language were learned," explains Strang.
Zemgals did not allow himself to be compelled to run again, he did not like such high positions.
In all respects, he is a very respectable person in Latvian history, even before his arrival at the President's Palace he was in a serious position - he was a highly sought-after notary.
Zemgals also led the famous Zemgala kasi on Suvorova street 3, where there was a society of artisans and artisanal lenders, in which practically in government negotiations became the Latvian state.
He was always in a progressive mood.
He was not a great admirer of Ulman, but publicly did not object to him either.
"In private talks, it has sometimes been said that Ulman's actions do not really sympathize with him," Strang said.
Lived a peaceful life, there is no suspicion of illegality or corruption.
How is Zemgale remembered today?
I’m sorry, but for the most part he associates himself with some street in Riga.
He was an absolute democrat, his views were centered.
"There were no major shocks during his time, that is, he could be associated with such a really stable presidency," Strang sums up.
During the presidency of Gustav Zemgale, from 1927 to 1930, a Latvian state visit to Sweden also took place, which at that time indirectly meant full recognition of Latvia in the neighbouring country and inclusion in the family of democratic nations of Northern Europe.
On 28 May 1929, Zemgale arrived for a state visit to Stockholm.
The response visit of King Gustav V of Sweden to Latvia took place on 29 June 1929.
The second president of Latvia was born in 1871, but left forever in January 1939.
Simple ways to help the child cope with the attacks of anger.
I often have to face the fact that the child's anger, the appearance of anger, parents consider something wrong and abnormal.
When the child openly expresses his anger - we do not know how to react, "Econet" indicates psychologist Ekaterina Kesa.
The specialist encourages a small conversation about these so natural and human feelings - the anger and anger that everyone experiences periodically.
Aggression - it is already a physical activity directed at another person, and it usually occurs when we feel angry.
When we, adults, are angry, anxious - we usually know what's going on with us and how to deal with it.
We can express our anger and anger in ourselves: we can suppress, hide, keep in ourselves, tell about it to our friends or other relatives, we can sell a sofa in anger, smoke a cigarette (this is not the best way to exhale anger!), we can go in the shower and do something else.
We do not turn our aggression against others, because we know different ways to deal with these emotions.
Children, when anger strikes them, do not understand what is happening to them, how to name them and how to live with them.
They can say, "Get away!", "You're a fool", "Bad mom", "I don't see you", "I'm not going to argue with you" - and very rarely, when able to say, "I'm angry at you".
Children live in a literal sense, they are completely right here, at this moment, they are spontaneous and true to their feelings, and often also find themselves in the throes of various emotions.
It is very important that parents do not forbid the child to show feelings, including anger, not to resent it and not to see, but on the contrary - to help the child.
Do you need a break in your relationship?
A long day of work, where everything just didn't go as you'd like, or just a bad mood - there are so many reasons why you'd like to "unplug" from the world for a moment, a day, or even longer.
Is it possible to pause the relationship for a moment and breathe a little?
Does this indicate that each of the partners is on his or her own path?
They share their views at different ages.
John (23) is short and concise: "In my view, if you need a break in a relationship, then don't be with the right person."
In the meantime, Edward (30) has uncovered a scheme that may be able to help someone.
If you feel that your partner is starting to get on your nerves for every little thing, then definitely - this is the right time to study other hunting fields to understand if you miss her, or especially do not think about her or even do not want to see her again at all.
So the answer is - yes, stopping a break can help save time and understand how important the other half is to you.
Kaspars (29) reveals his theory.
In my opinion, a break from each other should be kept in a relationship every day, because if you spend time with a person 24 hours a day, seven days a week, then disputes are inevitable.
They are caused by the fact that you think about every little thing that the other does and it begins to fall on your nerves.
People start to get annoyed with each other, especially when you don’t even have anything to talk about anymore, just what you’ve done on a daily basis.
My personal experience makes me think so, so I haven’t been in a relationship for more than a couple of months.
If you think for a moment that somewhere else or with someone else is better - then why does this woman you are with deserve someone who can think that there is not enough good here and behind the mountains there are fields of paradise.
Thinking alone is a small betrayal.
If not, then not.
"I have, so a little condemn those who do not." says Edmunds (46).
What is the best way to get rid of the disease?
I think we all need a moment for space.
You can’t look each other in the eyes every moment, all the time, from morning to evening, and rejoice at the unfailing love.
- Attopies!
There are so many things - friends, work, parties.
Everyone has their own time.
Of course, also a girlfriend or wife, but if both can keep their balance between family life and the rest of the world, then it can live to the edge of the grave.
So and only so.
Martins (27) says it this way: "It is difficult to say - whether you need it or not, can or should not take it a break, but one thing is clear - the proponent of it does not have something in the relationship to the end, something is lacking."
If this question is raised, then it should be assumed that in the near future there will be some changes - to the right or to the wrong side, it depends on itself.
I think that while you are still young and crazy, in the meantime you need to pause - something all the time, but when everything remains serious and the relationship enters a completely different phase, then there can be no talk about rest.
You decide to spend your whole life together!
“If you can’t stand each other’s society right now and you need a breath every once in a while, then what will happen when you’re pensioners who comment on how passing cats sniff or argue about which day the garden is better to sniff?” explains Kristaps (19).

“In this sense, he was the first love of the Latvian people, which as such will remain unforgettable forever,” wrote Romans Suta about the Latvian master painter Jani Rozental.
Also in 2016, when the old master’s extensive retrospective exhibition was unveiled in the restored main building of the Latvian National Museum of Art, it is clear that Rozent<0xC4><0x81>ls is the first love of Latvian art.
The exhibition was opened on 12 August, but from 13 August it is available to visitors and will be on view until 30 October.
The National Museum of Art of Latvia with a wide retrospective in the newly opened Great Exhibition Hall is a year of painter Jani Rozental (1866-1916), whose one hundred and fiftyth birthday is included in the UNESCO Celebration Day calendar on an international scale.
The retrospective exhibition, which includes more than 150 works, is one of the central events of Jan Rozental’s annual anniversary programme.
The selection of works of art is mostly made from the collection of the Latvian National Museum of Art, which convincingly represents the main stages and genres of the classic's creative activity, stylistic variation and diversity of techniques.
In addition, exhibits from the Axel Gallen-Kalle Museum, the Museum of Writing and Music, the Liepaja Museum, the Tukums Museum and several private collections in Latvia and Finland have been used.
The presence of photographs revitalizes the atmosphere of the millennia, the mobile application of the exhibition reveals a separate work of art interviews with photographs taken by the painter himself with his camera for the purposes of creativity.
In turn, the Finnish-Latvian Association "Rozent<0xC4><0x81>ls-seura", named after a Latvian classic, offers at the same time small informative travelling exhibitions "With a look in Finland, with a heart in Latvia" at the National Museum of Art of Latvia.
A similar exhibition with content in English, Finnish and Swedish will open in autumn at the "Virka" gallery in Helsinki.
Mets LeBlanc is eagerly awaiting the return of the show "TopGear".
The head of TopGear, Metz LeBlanc, said he was looking forward to the return of the show in season two, but admitted that he did not know what awaits him in the future.
So far, nothing is officially happening.
"If there is, then the BBC will announce it," LeBlanc revealed in a conversation with television critics.
Doubts about the future of "Gas in the Floor!" arose in July, when Leblanc's teammate Chris Evans announced that he was leaving the show.
After leaving, Evans admitted that LeBlanc and "Gaze in the Floor!" were "as created for each other."
Evans describes the star of the former "Friends" series as a "true and good husband", thus exclaiming the rumors that the friendship between the two was confused during filming.
When Leblanc was asked what he liked most about the show, he replied that traveling to other countries, such as South Africa, Morocco and Ireland.
The BBC reports that the show is not yet scheduled to replace Evans in its new 24th season.

It is expected that the meldonium in the composition of the drug Mildronat produced in Latvia could be excluded from the list of prohibited substances for athletes already this year, on Friday morning, the director of the Institute of Organic Synthesis of Latvia, academician Ivvis Kalvars, said on the LNT broadcast for 900 seconds.
He said he would go to Canada in September to discuss the report with representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
The scientist expressed hope that Mildronata will be removed from the "black list" already this year.
After the collision, two cyclists were taken to the hospital.
In Sigulda, on Swiss Street, two cyclists collided, suffering various injuries, according to the State Police.
The accident involved men born in 1987 and 1990, both of whom were taken to a medical institution.
What is the best way to do this?
In 1989, a man was born who fell on 1905 Street and was taken to medical care.
In turn, in Dobele County, in Naud<0xC4><0xAB>te Parish, a motorcyclist born in 1989 tried to avoid a dog that ran off on the road and got lost.
He's in the hospital, too.
In the last day there were 71 road accidents in Latvia, in which 16 people were injured.
Sometimes it rains and gets colder.
Also on Friday in Latvia there will be some temporary rain in some places and it will become a little bit colder, the agency LETA learned at the center of Latvian Environment, Geology and Meteorology.
You may be able to snooze.
According to forecasts, rain is expected mainly in Kurzeme and Vidzeme in the north.
The maximum air temperature will only be within +16, +19 degrees.
In Riga, the day will pass without precipitation and the sun will shine mostly.
However, the air will not be warmer than +18 degrees.
The backdrop of the business of US models has gained in his interpretation the gloss of a perversely sophisticated photo session and the impatience of a horror film.
In fact, it is a very provocative work, balancing sophistication and banal vulgarity, in which it is difficult to draw the lines between the European art house film and the territory of the Hollywood genre product.
The film, starring Vigo Mortensen, highlights the question of whether parents’ conceptually chosen lifestyles (ecology, vegetarianism, alternativeism and detachment from consumerism and values) bring blessings or destructiveness to their children.
The idealist father of six children after the death of his wife is confronted with questions about the correctness of the choices and the true values.

Of course, sharks only do it as attacking beautiful girls - in the jaws it was a swimmer, in this case - a brave surfer, who is portrayed by Blake Shipwreck.
The work demanded of her a thorough heroism.
This survival solo number can be compared to the 127 Hours of James Franko's Mastery of Acting and Raine Reinolds' Game in A Scouted Alive.
Perhaps the main role of the illustrator Mila Kunis is also to blame, whose transformation from a model mother into a creative survivor and a snatcher of almost family values seems to have been created solely by the fantasies of all-desperate Hollywood screenwriters.
The Islamic State has captured 2,000 civilians in Syria.
Islamic State fighters on the run from Manbij, Syria’s Aleppo province, have captured some 2,000 civilians used as live shields, a US-backed Kurdish-Arab alliance and observers said on Friday.
"We didn't kill them because they took civilians with them when they fled to Jerubbaal," a spokesman for the Kurdish Manbij military council said.
After two months of fighting, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (QSD), a US-backed Kurdish-Arab alliance in northern Syria, announced Friday that Menbija has been liberated from jihadists.
The Islamic State of Menbiju was captured in 2014.
QSD already last week inflamed most of the fighters of the Islamic State of Manbij, but some of them resisted and showed resistance.
However, on Friday they left the city, taking captives with them.
Islamists go to Gerabulus, which is on the Turkish border.
The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) also reported that the Islamic State has kidnapped some 2,000 people.
SOHR reported that the Islamists had hijacked the cars of the city’s residents, forced people to tear them down, and then brought them to Jerubbaal.
Islamic State fighters have also carried out mass kidnappings in the past.
In January, Islamists kidnapped more than 400 civilians, including women and children, when they conquered the territory of Deir ez-Zor in Syria's eastern province.
Later, about 270 of the captives were released by the Islamists.
It is not known how many Islamic State fighters have fled Manbij.
A spokesman for the Kurdish Manbij Military Council reported that the QSD had managed to rescue 2,500 people held by Islamists in Manbij.
The information gathered by SOHR shows that at least 437 civilians, including 105 children, lost their lives in the Battle of Menbiju.
299 QSD fighters and 1019 jihadists were killed.

The head of the State Environmental Service, Inga Ko<0xC4><0xBC>egova, decided to withdraw his candidacy for the position of Director General of the State Revenue Service (VID), the agency LETA informed the Ministry of Finance.
Ko<0xC4><0xBC>egova notes that the discussion of her candidacy has increased the contradictions between the ruling coalition parties.
It seems that the real reasons for the discussions are related to the interests seen by politicians, but more often, invisible, and they have nothing to do with my assessment of my professional skills.
"This is also not acceptable to me," emphasizes a former candidate for the post of head of the VID.
In the event that her candidacy would be approved by the government, it would be clear that this would not be a convincing vote and would not allow the necessary changes to be fully worked out and implemented by the VID, feeling the support of the whole government.
Without it, full-fledged work would not be possible, concludes Ko<0xC4><0xBC>egova.
“I’ve often publicly stressed that I don’t want to be politically dependent, but at the moment my entire candidacy process is overly politicised,” the official explains.
"Thanks for the trust and support I have shown, it is an experience that I value as an advantage," writes Ko<0xC4><0xBC>egova in the submission to Reisniece-Ozola.
The unanimity on Wednesday showed that during the meeting with Kolegov there were "substantial contradictions" between the candidate's explanations and the information available in the public registers about the cost of dividends of SIA Pallogs, as publicly available decisions of the meetings of the Pallogs participants do not provide for profit sharing.
Currently, Dace Greyka, Deputy Director-General of the SID, is the Head of the SID.
The police in L<0xC4><0xAB>v<0xC4><0x81>nas are involved in the rescue of two unattended children, informs the State Police Administration of Latgale region.
You can also use it as an alternative to using it as an alternative to using it.
They are located in L<0xC4><0xAB>v<0xC4><0x81>nos near the former store building.
The two little girls were immediately handed over to the doctors for help.
There was also a bag with documents and a mobile phone in the trolleys.
In less than half an hour, the law enforcement officers found out the possible location of the parents of the children and went there.
When a woman's civilian came home, the police found out that the woman was sleeping because she was under strong alcoholism.
According to the initial information, on the evening of the previous day, a woman born in 1992 visited a friend who had been drinking alcohol.
When going home after a joint session, the woman has decided to leave the children at the store under unexplained circumstances.
The police immediately informed the orphan’s court about the incident, which will also decide the future fate of the children.
The free port of Riga has implemented all the recommendations of the WC regarding the project of the Russian island.
The Administration of the Free Port of Riga has implemented all of the five recommendations of the State Control (UK) regarding the project Infrastructure development for the transfer of port activities from the city center on the Russian island, the portal Diena.lv informed in the company.
The approval of the project is planned at the next meeting of the Riga Freeport Board.
In order to implement the recommendations in accordance with the opinion of the VK, in preparing the necessary documentation for the implementation of the recommendations, the Riga Freeport Authority was also guided by the conclusions of the legal and operational audit carried out in the Deloitte Freeport Authority of Riga and the subsequent recommendations of the project.
Information on the implementation of the recommendations has also been sent to the UK today.
Despite the fact that the Riga Free Port Authority does not agree with the opinion prepared by the UK on the usefulness of the implementation of the Russian island project, we have a very responsible attitude towards the implementation of the project and the funding provider - the European Commission (EC).
I would like to stress that all planned construction works within the project are completed in full within the specified deadlines and in the planned amount.
"To prove to all those involved in the implementation of the project, including the EC, the UK and also the stevidors, that the main goal of the free port is to successfully implement the project, we have fully implemented all the recommendations of the UK regarding the issues of project management and supervision," says the head of the Russian island project San.
The existing long-term action plan for monitoring and monitoring the achievement of the project goal was supplemented with the most important planned actions of the parties involved and the necessary decision-making deadlines, definitions of meetings and regular reports and their deadlines, definitions of the planned construction process monitoring tools, as well as relevant
The approved action plan for achieving the project goal by December 31, 2018, in accordance with the recommendations of the VK, is supplemented by performance monitoring activities, thereby strengthening the time-limit control of the activities of other parties involved in the implementation of the project by the free port of Riga.
To improve project management and reduce potential risks, a project management plan has been re-developed, defining project management areas and indicating the documents developed that provide a control and monitoring mechanism for each of them.
To increase the capacity of the project, a project management structure scheme has been developed, which reflects the planned structure of the project management team, the qualifications and functions of the employees.
In order to improve the communication of the Free Port of Riga administration with the parties involved in the project, a communication plan of the stakeholders in the project has been developed, which, in addition to the parties defined in the project action plan, defines the stakeholders, principles of information exchange, types and periodicity for successful completion of the project.
In turn, in order to improve the control of the use of financial resources, the need for the conclusion of a service contract or the initiation of a procurement and the rule of law will need to be justified in more detail in the future.
Within the framework of the project, the Russian island has built a port infrastructure that meets the world standards - four new deep-water piers, railway access, as well as engineering communications.
The Cohesion Fund co-financed construction works have been completed and put into operation at the end of the year already, achieving savings of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10.6 million in funding.
Threats have increased security at airports in Slovakia.
After receiving non-specific threats, Slovakia on Friday stepped up security measures at several airports, the Interior Ministry said.
"Given the threats, we have stepped up security measures at international airports in Bratislava, Poprad and Ko<0xC5><0xA1>ice," a spokesman for Slovakia's Interior Ministry told AFP on Friday.
"The National Security and Analysis Centre is currently analysing the information we have received," he added.
On 16 September, an informal summit of the European Union (EU) will take place in the Slovak capital, which will be attended by all bloc countries except the United Kingdom.
The meeting will discuss the consequences of the UK’s Brexit referendum and discuss the future of the EU without Britain.
Until January, Slovakia is the EU Presidency.
German researchers are discussing the number of victims of the Berlin Wall.
According to a new study, the death toll at the communist camps in former East Germany may be much higher than previously thought, but doubts about the true number of victims remain unresolved.
According to data released on Wednesday by the Checkpoint Charlie Berlin Wall Museum, between 1945 and 1989, at the border with western allied areas and later West German communist authorities murdered 1,841 people trying to escape from their controlled territory.
The museum has been investigating border-related deaths for years and adjusting the number of victims from time to time.
This year, 11 more deaths have been added to the list, including among the victims a six-year-old boy who drowned while trying to get to West Germany through Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
Among the young victims of the Berlin Wall are also deserters of the Soviet army.
"The ultimate extent of the damage done by the double evil of communism and socialism has not yet been fully documented," admits museum director Aleksandra Hildebrante.
"Our task is to ensure that the graves of the people who died trying to escape from the communist-controlled state are cared for and not lost," Hildebrandt said in a statement.
However, other researchers have already questioned the new figures.
"The figure of 1841 is inconclusive," states Johans Statt, an expert on the history of East Germany at the Free University of Berlin, in an interview with the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper.
Together with other researchers at the Free University of Berlin, he is currently reviewing suspected deaths at the border, and so far they have only been able to confirm 260 cases.
Previously, researchers estimated that 138 people were murdered by communists near the Berlin Wall alone.
Given the number of people who have died trying to escape across the Baltic Sea or to reach the West through the territory of neighbouring countries, according to the State, the number of victims could reach about a thousand.
However, this is considerably less than in 1841.
One of the reasons for the different number of victims could be different methodologies.
The Checkpoint Charlie Museum also records all the suicides of the East German border guards, regardless of whether they were directly related to their service.
The museum also lists deaths that are not directly related to violence.
"If seniors aged 70 to 80 years after collapsing with border controls die from a heart attack," it must be the consequences of this "murderous border," Hildebrant believes.
However, the State is convinced that a distinction must be made between the elderly, who may have died as a result of their experience of treatment, and those whose deaths were caused by prolonged waiting in the hot weather on the bus at the border.
Regardless of this, the census of victims is not easy, because the communist authorities of East Germany did not collect such statistics, and researchers must select documents in various scattered archives, states Stats.
However, the State Group has recently submitted new documents and could therefore come up with an estimate of the number of new victims in the near future.
Mr. President of the LPF went to Rio with the accreditation of the coach; it is a surprise to him.
In the last few days, the president of the Latvian Swimming Federation (LPF), Kaspars Pone Riode<0xC5><0xBE>aneiro, who has won a lot of fame, has come to the Olympics with the accreditation of the coach, but he himself is surprised by it.
On Wednesday, a wide-ranging uproar was caused by the statements of Olympic swimmer Alona Ribakovas, German Yakubovska, who revealed that at the last moment he decided to go to Rio de Janeiro while the coach had to stay at home.
Initially, the list of riders included swimmers Alona Ribakova and Uvis Kalni<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>, coaches Jakubovskis and Daivs Kolins, as well as the president of the federation Mr.
The Latvian Swimming Federation submitted five participants to the Olympic Games, and even before the departure Aldons Vrub<0xC4><0xBC>evskis claimed that Germans will be and he is looking for tickets.
"However, apparently for objective reasons, he was not," Mr. said, expressing the opinion that it did not affect the result of Ribakova.
At the request of the federation, the coach of Uvja undertook to help her.
The Commissioner, himself a member of the LOK Executive Committee, sharply criticised the LOK's activities by blaming the Olympic sports watchdog.
In my view, it is unethical for the Executive Committee of the LOK to approve five persons and not to exclude one of them.
"I don't know why the Swimming Federation didn't have enough space," Mr. said that the work of the federation and its presidents was not appreciated in society, recalling that the presidents of the federations don't receive salaries.
He also criticized Jakubovski, saying that before the London Olympics, when Ribakova was not confirmed among the participants, he complained to the International Water Sports Federation (FINA) and urged Latvia not to send any athletes.
If you are a member of the European Union, you will be able to use your personal data for the purposes of the European Union’s external relations policy.
"I was nominated as a federation president ("team leader"), but for unknown reasons I got coach accreditation and now I'm not going anywhere."
The situation changed every day, the number of available accreditations changed.
Until the last moment I thought that Germans would, because I had no other information.
According to the information available to the agency LETA, a few days before the start of Ribakovas, she had a face-to-face conversation with Poni and after her swimmer had tears in her eyes, however, the president of the LPF himself said that it was a daily conversation with the desire to tune the athlete before the start.
Mr. recalled that LPF supervises five sports that are in the Olympic program, and four of them are training children also in Latvia.
The President of the Federation said that the issues of drowning are also very important in Latvia and also about such programs he talked about when he was in Rio de Janeiro for almost two weeks.
He praised the work of the federation and said that the World Cup could be held in Latvia in 2018.
The location of Rio de Janeiro is not my vacation, I work here, I spend my time and I try to implement the four-year programs.
You will be able to feed 600,000 salmon in the daugavpils.
During the program of restoration of fish resources of AS Latvenergo this week in Daugavpils near Manga<0xC4><0xBC>sa, salmon and mackerel babies are being introduced, and this year it is planned to introduce more than 600,000 annual salmon and mackerel babies raised by the scientific institute Bior Tomes and Dole fish.
Leta informed the Latvian energy agency that the introduction of fish will continue in the coming months - every year a total of 6,300,000 different species of fish babies and larvae are introduced into the water bodies of the Daugava basin.
In the spring and early summer of 2016, larvae and lizards will be released, in June - s<0xC4><0xAB>gas, in July - summer salmon, in August and September - zandarti and vimbas.
Latvenergo Production Director M<0xC4><0x81>ris Kunickis said that concern for the environment is one of the cornerstones of the Latvenergo Group’s sustainable development.
"In the measures for the protection and reproduction of fish resources, each activity is focused on environmentally friendly actions in close cooperation with the scientific institute Bior, carrying out both the rearing and introduction of fish babies in the Daugava basin and other activities," said Kunickis.
This year, more than 600,000 annual salmon and chicks will be placed in the dam of Daugava.
For the second year of the fish, the chicks are marked by cutting the grease.
Today, the cargo has 25,000 salmon chicks with an average weight of 31.3 grams.
Every year, in the scientifically justified composition and numerical volume of species in Daugavpils and its basin, the introduction of fish babies and larvae takes place.
The reproduction of fish resources in Daugavpils and its basin aquifers is carried out by Bior in accordance with the laws and regulations, based on an examination of the losses caused by the economic activity of Latvenergo for fish resources and giving a conclusion on what compensation measures can be taken to ensure the abundance of fish resources.
The National Environment Service, on the basis of that expertise, shall decide on the amount and type of compensation.
The annual amount of compensation for Latvenergo under the fishery recovery programme shall be EUR 1 035 000.
In the spring of 2016, Latvenergo, in cooperation with the association "M<0xC4><0x97>s fisk<0xC4><0xAB>ms" (We the Fishes), will place 400 artificial fish hatchery nests in Daugavpils near Kaibala and Ik<0xC5><0xA1><0xC4><0xB7>iles.
Cooperation with the Society in promoting the natural healing of fish is an initiative supported by Latvenergo within the framework of the program for the restoration of fish resources.
The placement of artificial herring nests in a water reservoir is an important measure that contributes to the protection and reproduction of fish resources in Daugavpils.
The festival "Sansus<0xC4><0xAB> concert hall" is a country courtyard, forest, cirsma.
Guli in a tent, eats like a restaurant, walks around and listens to inquiring chamber music, enjoying the quiet peace of nature - such a combination is offered by the alternative chamber music festival in Sansussi, which invites the Akn<0xC4><0xAB>stes region for the third summer.
The festival will take place in Sus<0xC4><0x81>jas - a no longer existing village - in the courtyard of the former parish house, next to forests and cirs.
In three days - from 12 to 14 August - you can combine the exquisite pleasure of carefree nature and academic music on five stages.
Here, the theatre and contemporary circus, performances and installations meet with music.
Opera and academic music, especially in its latest expressions, finds new listeners in a free and open environment without the rigidity of concert halls.
The distance from here to Riga is about 150 km, but to a smile in the face and ease in the legs only a few minutes.
"Please do not look for a program, because we have deliberately chosen not to publish it in advance, so that people do not go to one specific event or artist, because the real taste of Sansussi can only be captured by spending all three days in it," invites the festival's initiator and host, operbaritone Armands Sili<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>.
The gates of the festival are on Friday at 17:00, and the first concert is at 19:00.
Of course, there will be on-site programs with all the information.
For those who have to choose one day, we recommend Saturday, because it is the most saturated - from 9 am until the next morning.
"The names of artists are available on the website www.sansusi.lv," says Armands Sili<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>.
In the magnificent artist’s bouquet there are, for example, the violinist Eva Bindere, the cellist Krist<0xC4><0xAB>ne Blaumane, the opera star Inga Kalna, the clarinetist Guntis Kuzma, the trumpeter J<0xC4><0x81>nis Porietis, the pianist Reinis Zari<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>, the quartets Quadra and RIX ark<0xC4><0x81>g<0xC4><0xAB><0xC5><0xAB>n<0xC4><0xAB>.
There are also newcomers to the festival.
The show for children "Kukainis", composed by Olesya Kozlovska and J<0xC4><0x93>kabs Nimanis, together with Armanda Silinas, musicians and actors will participate in the entomologist (insect researcher) Ugis Piter<0xC4><0x81>ns.
Oskars Herli<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> has compiled the first String Quartet, while Anna Kirse - Wooden Opera, a performance whose main characters in the direction of Andras Kalnozol with Katrina Neiburgs video projections and Andras Eglis scenography will be trees in three small puddles in the three hectares wide.
Singing in the voices of Laima Ledina, Dinara Rud<0xC4><0x81>na and Zigm<0xC4><0x81>ra Gra<0xC5><0xA1>a, they will enter into romantic relationships, just as in the study of the Tree Wedding (1729) by Swedish naturalist Karl Linnaeus of the Enlightenment.
The Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro are being held today by seven-fighter Laura Ikauniece-Admid<0xC4><0xAB><0xC5><0x86>a, one of the highest hopes of the Latvian delegation.
Ikauniece-Admid<0xC4><0xAB><0xC5><0x86>a will start the race at 15:35 after Latvian time in the 100-meter barrier race, but at 16:50 in the expected race in the high jump.
In addition, on Saturday at 2.35 a.m., the ball will start to break, while at 4.05 a.m. - 200 meters sprint.
The seven-fight competitions will be concluded on Saturday, when the long jump, sprinting and the 800-meter race will take place.
Before the Olympic Games, Ikauniece-Admidini, who last year competed in the bronze world championship, was mentioned as a contender for the Olympic medals.
In May, Latvia set a new national record (6622 points) and took second place in the prestigious seven-fight competitions in the Austrian city of Gecis.
Ikauniece-Admid<0xC4><0xAB><0xC5><0x86>a also participated in the 2012 London Olympics, when she won ninth place with a repeated Latvian record.
In the last year and a half, the athlete has corrected the national record four times.
Today at 16 a.m. the start is also planned for Latvian judo fighter Art<0xC5><0xAB>ras Nikiforenko, who starts in the weight category over 100 kilograms, first finishing the fight with Azerbaijani athlete U<0xC5><0xA1>angi Kukauri.
This will be the first Olympic Games for the Judiciary.
It is important to note that this is not the case, as it is the case in the case of the European Commission, but rather in the case of the European Parliament and the Council.
He succumbed to the Japanese Hagu Rjunoski, who later won the bronze.
In 2000, Vsevolod Ze<0xC5><0xBC>onis won Latvia the Olympic bronze medal, but in the next four Olympic Games, Latvian judici won only one victory in seven battles, which was won by Borodavko in London.
If you do not have the right to access your personal data, you may not be able to access the personal data that you have provided to us.
The meritorious received the Olympic roadmark only on the day when the composition of the Latvian delegation was officially announced, but later he revealed to the agency LETA that he had been quite confident about driving since April.
If you are not a member of the European Union, you are not a member of the European Union, and you are not a member of the European Union.
19:05 After Latvian time, the three final races will be held by the debutant of the Olympic Games, 17-year-old Latvian sailor Ketija Birzule, who competes in windsurfing in RS:X class.
After three days or nine trips, Birzule is currently ranked 25th among 26 athletes.
On Saturday, however, there will be a decisive final run for medals.
Today, it is finally planned to hold a competition in the academic airing, where the Latvian representative of Ireland Sanitas Pu<0xC5><0xA1>pura has to participate.
On Wednesday, the competition was cancelled due to unfavorable weather conditions.
At 19:10, Pu<0xC5><0xA1>pure will compete in the C/D semi-final for the only ladies, fighting for 13th place in the Olympics.
On Tuesday, in the quarter-finals, she finished fourth, from the third position, which would allow the fight for the medal to continue, lagging behind by no more than 0.65 seconds.
It is the first time that a person has ever been in a relationship with another person.
Today in the Olympic Games will be distributed 24 sets of medals - archery, athletics, trekking, rowing, archery, trampling, judo, academic aeration, shooting, swimming, tennis and weightlifting.
Reid claims that if Clinton is elected president, then she will appoint Garland as a judge of the Supreme Court.
Senate Democratic Party leader Harry Reid is confident that in the event that she becomes president, she will nominate Merrick Garland as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
The Senate Republican Party has blocked Garland’s approval since he was nominated by President Obama in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced that the next president will choose who will replace the current Supreme Court Justice Antonina Skalia.
During his conference on Thursday, Reid announced that he was confident that Clinton would choose Garland.
Reid's representative later said that he had not spoken to Clinton about the matter in person and it was speculation.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team would not want to "swing the boat" with another choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the U.S. Columbia District Court of Appeals.
Reid said the Republicans blocking Garland's nomination are "incumbents" and acting in the interests of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also said that Trump was not fit for the president's job.
Treats announce a nude photo calendar for women and men.
Treats will collaborate with photographer David Belmer to create the 2017 Pirreli calendar in the style of the 1970s.
In its 2017 NU Muzu calendar it is planned to demonstrate new supermodels, not naked celebrities.
Earlier this year, Treats magazine president Steve Shaw announced that his erotic art magazine is different from the old-fashioned Playboy because "Playboy is a men's magazine".
This magazine is for women.
He also seems to be talking about the calendar.
In a press release about the creation of the calendar, Shaw says: "We need to return to the imagery of unblemished and classic nudity, where the body of a woman does not flinch, but inspires both women and men."
Women will want to participate in this project, because it is an excellent work of art.
Models can submit their photos electronically or in person at casting sessions in Los Angeles and New York.
Rembat<0xC4><0x93> buyer, trying the motorcycle, leans in.
In the case of an unregistered Yamaha YZ250 motorcycle stolen from the courtyard of a house in Rembate parish at 10 a.m., the State Police informs.
The owner of the motorcycle had wanted to sell the powerplant with the help of an advertisement.

Greenland shark is the longest-living vertebrate - video review
Scientists claim that Greenland sharks have the longest lifespan of all the vertebrates on our planet.
Haifisch researcher Julius Nilsen says that the longevity record belongs to a female who could be 272 to 512 years old and five meters long.
The French court rejects the demand to demolish shops in the "Jungle" refugee camp.
The French court rejected the authorities' demand to demolish dozens of self-made shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where several thousand refugees live.
At a court hearing in Calais this week, authorities said that the state should demolish 72 self-made shops where people in the camp area sell various goods, such as cigarettes and energy drinks, offer hairdresser services, tea for 50 cents (40p) and simple meals for a meal.
The prefect's office in Kale said that these self-made businesses must be demolished because they form a shadow economy and do not pay taxes, as well as create fire and sanitation risks.
The representatives of the humanitarian group explained to the court that these small businesses are essential because the food provided by the government and support groups does not meet the needs of the camp, where the number of residents continues to increase.
They also pointed out that self-made shops and restaurants often offer free shelter and food to those who need it most.
The Lille court ruled that there is no legal basis to expel people who have set up 72 self-made shops, but it understands the prefect's concerns in Calais.
Judge Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Molla said that food, coffee and restaurants play a greater role than simply providing food for people who live in "extremely poor" conditions.
He pointed out that these places are a peaceful meeting place for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places at risk of demolition is the Jungle Book Kids camp cafe, which provides more than 200 free meals a day, English and French classes, and provides asylum advice to hundreds of vulnerable minors without adult guidance.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition for the protection of children's cafes.
In a letter to the Guardian, it was stated that the elimination of the cafe "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old."
On Friday, two charities, Aid for Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, reported that the number of residents of the Jungle camp has risen to 9,000, the highest since the rapid influx of migrants in the summer.
The United Kingdom wins silver in the rugby-7 series when the Fiji national team masterfully crowns gold.
The impressive performance of the British national team in the Rugby-7 series ended on Thursday, when the national team of the exciting final match at the stadium "Deodoro" in Rio Fiji convincingly beat them with a score of 43:7.
Fiji demonstrated a master class in the management of the ball, playing the ball with the leg, supporting the game and the game of brutal force, winning gold - the first Olympic medal in the history of its existence.
The cassock brought a prestigious consolation prize - a silver medal, which was the third British medal at the time. The British team can be proud of their success in the first Olympic Rugby-7 tournament, in which they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A heavy fight in the semi-final, in which the Boxing team beat with a score of 7:5 in the first half of the day, may have played for Great Britain in the final.
But in any case, the Fiji squad is now in its best form to win also a team of 15 men.
While unlikely, however, a certain consolation for Britain could be the fact that at least one Briton won a gold medal. This is Fiji's head coach Ben Rain - former England coach from Wimbledon.
It was an exciting adventure for the UK.
Eight years ago, under the leadership of Rain, they lost all games in the Rugby-7 series in Adelaide.
This time they only lost one game.
The disease is painful, but the growth is astonishing.
Fiji impressively started the match, reviving the techniques of the British force after joy.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and his teammates, it was like a collision with a number of buses going against each other, and the World Series champions came out in the lead with 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau won the first landing.
In the last four minutes, Jerry Tuwai also increased his dominance even further, achieving a landing in the right wing.
The result was 12:0 and the British team had not even really touched the ball.
Mitchell's excellent technique of strength prevented the accommodating Leoni Nakarava from scoring three points, but it only slightly affected the result of Fiji.
In the seventh minute of the game, Jasa Veremalua landed in the right corner, consolidating the lead over Great Britain to 17:0.
After the rematch, Nakarava increased his dominance even more and by the end there was more than a minute left... at the end of the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou avoided some awkward techniques of British force and crossed the line, gaining points.
The landing resulted in a score of 29:0.
It seems that Fiji was born to play rugby-7 matches, while the British are still learning.
In fact, it is also true.
The British team made fundamental changes in half time, crossing the Fiji player line... full four minutes, which was good by the standards of the first half, until Joshua Tuisov, after a fantastic team match, got a few more points in favor of the Fiji team.
Dan Norton managed to score points for the British team by landing in the left corner and achieving a score of 36:7, but the game was already lost, while South Sea Islanders fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
You can’t help but admire Fiji’s life-satisfying attitude.
Mata Viliame made Fiji’s victory even sweeter with another landing at the end of the game.
When the game was over, Fiji could start celebrating, but the British were able to sit in the hall after the defeat.
In the first half of the day, Fiji defeated Japan with a score of 20:5, while the British were ahead of South Africa, where in a very fierce fight both teams won by landing and the South Africans lost only a few points.
In the first half, Kail Brown led the Boxing team, but in the second half, Dens Norton, with brilliant skill, crossed the line and brought the ball between the poles, securing the British victory.
Mark Watson, the brother of England's rugby-15 player Antonis, gave the team a victory and another silver medal at the end of the game.
The coach’s fight with cancer inspired Helen Glover and Heather Staning to win the rowing competition.
It will be the most emotional gold medal in these races and it already expresses a lot.
From the first to the last cancer, the golden moment of Helen Glover and Hetera Staning played a special role in the Estacio da Lagoa route.
Although there are only two athletes on board, she was accompanied by the support of Robin Williams, who inspired her to win the second Olympic gold medal in pairs in women's rowing, becoming the first woman in British sports history to achieve such successes.
She undoubtedly dominated, as for the 39th time she won an unbeatable, unprecedented victory.
Both excellent athletes with the elegance of a sponge gliding on the water surface do not fully reflect this triumph.
Behind every gold medal won, there is a whole team that works hard to ensure that athletes continuously improve their performance and make the greatest contribution to their successes by a coach who 30 months ago did not know if he would experience this day because he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it disappeared as quickly as it appeared.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of those that could be operated on and so it happened.
If not, it would spread throughout the body.
And the situation would become uncontrollable.
It changes your vision a little bit.
William's cancer was discovered in December 2013.
This trio succeeded in initiating the recovery procedure at the beginning of the 2014 inter-season and reducing the duration of the break to a minimum, if one can say so.
I needed income, so I had to recover quickly.
It stimulated the recovery.
I was in the hospital and walked a distance of 6, 10 and even 15 meters, although the doctor said that a few steps would suffice.
It all started.
Riding in itself is a challenge, but this time it was even bigger.
After the victory, the first thought was immediately about William, who was very worried all morning and spoke more than usual under the impression of excitement.
Staning, who has served in the Royal Artillery unit in Afghanistan, said: "This was an emotionally difficult week, but it means a lot to me."
It just confirms how much it means to us and how much Helen and Robin have worked.
The three years spent with Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin we would not have achieved anything, so huge thanks to him, he is the best coach in the world.
I can’t think of a better coach or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heter Staning have not lost in any race in five years.
The pair reaches such a huge speed that competitors can not compete.
Even in the last 500 meters, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, the dominance of Staning and Glover was too great.
We felt every moment.
Helen yelled, "Keep the rhythm, keep the rhythm."
It is really important not to lose focus.
We had a good start, but at the same time we did not have high hopes.
On that day, we had no intention of breaking records, but just to race well and win the races and we did too.
A couple of years will rest to decide what to do next.
Next month will be the wedding of Glover and TV adventurer Steve Bashal.
In the meantime, she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn’t mean to say that this was my last game.
That would have been too much pressure.
In London, it took me about six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
It was a new experience and I was very excited.
This time it took about four minutes.
She said, "The feeling is fantastic."

According to him, now Prime Minister M<0xC4><0x81>ris Ku<0xC4><0x8D>inski (Union of Greens and Peasants) and Minister of Finance Dana Reisniece-Ozola (Union of Greens and Peasants) are already "principally important" for the candidates headed by the Minister of Finance Ko<0xC4><0xBC>egova to be approved as head of the VID.
Rajevski estimated that both Ku<0xC4><0x8D>inski and Reisniece-Ozola’s approval of the head of the SID in this government is “the first big decision” that could affect his future as a politician.
If now begins to change the position in the selection of the candidate for the post of Head of the VID, then it will have a negative impact on their image in the state administration.
The Cabinet of Ministers next week’s meeting includes the issue of transfer of the head of the VVD Kolegova to the post of Director General of the VID, the government’s agenda shows.
The head of the VID was appointed by Minister of Finance Reizniece-Ozola after In<0xC4><0x81>r P<0xC4><0x93>tersone resigned from the management of the service and when the contest for the post of Director General of the VID ended without result.
If you are a member of the European Union, you will be able to apply for the position of head of the European Union in an interview with Latvijas Radio on Thursday, August 11th.
The Minister of Finance later admitted that no other candidates for the post of Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are being considered for the time being.
In addition, the head of the Saeima of the National Union, Raivis Dzintars, admitted that NA continues to support Ko<0xC4><0xBC>egovs VID.
In Spain, the possibility of reducing the budget deficit is threatened by the inability to set up a government.
On 12 July, the European Commission (EC) stated that Spain and Portugal had not taken sufficient measures to reduce the level of the budget deficit to the 3% of gross domestic product (GDP) demanded by the euro area.
Estimates show that, despite austerity measures, Portugal's budget deficit was 4.4% of GDP at the end of last year, while Spain was 5.1%.
However, the European Commission has decided not to impose economic sanctions on both countries, at the same time setting fiscal targets for the near future.
One of the reasons why the EC has not imposed sanctions on the two countries is the growing Euroscepticism in many countries of the European Union.
Additional sanctions such a negative mood would only multiply.
Critics point out that the EC is not consistent in its decisions by agreeing on uniform rules from the outset and then not being able to apply them in life.
For example, the President of the Bundesbank, Jens Veidmann, pointed out that Europe thus loses confidence in itself, creating in the public the idea that the rules of the European Union are recommendative, not binding.
The Commission has now proposed and all Member States have agreed to extend the deadline for the adjustment of the budget deficit until the end of this year for Portugal and until 2018 for Spain.
The European Commission promises to review the progress made by both countries in the coming months, at the same time pointing out that both Spain and Portugal must be ready to introduce additional austerity measures if circumstances so require.
Initial forecasts indicate that the target for Portugal could be met in due course and that the budget deficit could already be reduced to 2.5% of gross domestic product this year.
This means that, as part of the Stability Programme, the government of this country will have to implement austerity measures of 0.25% of GDP this year.
These measures should be included in this year's budget, with a further focus on controlling the cost of procurement of goods and services.
In the case of Spain, the situation is much more complex.
This year, the budget deficit should be reduced to 4.6%, next year to 3.1% and in 2018 to 2.2% of GDP.
In addition, for the next two years, consolidation measures should be 0.5% of GDP each year.
The fact that the Spanish political parties have not been able to agree on the establishment of a government for eight months makes it particularly difficult to achieve these objectives, and it is becoming increasingly likely that Spain may have to hold early parliamentary elections for the third time in a year.
However, public opinion polls show that the political landscape of the third election in the country would not change significantly.
The most popular party is still the People's Party led by the current Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, whose election would again win an incomplete 33% of the vote.
Only socialists have increased their popularity a little, while the popularity of the parties "Podemos" or "Together we can" and "Ciudadanos" or "Citizens" against austerity measures has decreased slightly.
The People's Party wants to get socialists and Ciudanos involved in the government later this month, otherwise it will not be able to adopt and submit to the European Commission for the approval of the draft budget for 2017 by mid-October.
As the representative of the People's Party's parliamentary group, Rafael Hernando, has said, if the government fails and parliamentary elections are held for the third time, Spain will become a laughingstock of all Europe.
The cleanliness of the beaches in the Gulf of Riga is critical.
When surveying the beaches for five years, activists have concluded that, unfortunately, the number of waste found increases every year, and most of the visitors to the bathing areas are to blame.
The most polluted bathing places are in Riga.
In the capital city, it is explained that the bathing areas are cleaned every day, but it is quite difficult to fight against dirty visitors.
In addition, waste left on land during rain showers can be diluted in water, thus significantly degrading its quality.
With the exception of Liepaja beach and certain places in Kurzeme, the cleanliness of beaches elsewhere in Latvia is critical.
Such a statement has been circulated this week by the volunteers of the "My Sea" campaign.
When measuring the way along the Gulf of Riga for five years, activists concluded that the number of waste left by the population has increased every hundred meters.
Unfortunately, this year’s critical assessment has come in.
"We see that this will be the year when the number of waste on the beach 100 meters, possibly even can exceed 200 units," says J<0xC4><0x81>nis Ulme, representative of the My Sea expedition.
When Latvian Radio was called, he was on Tuja beach, where the volunteer walk along the Gulf of Riga will continue.
This year, between the various household waste and the picnic remains, activists had to collect even daylight bulbs, which were left in the sand.
Ulme, the participant and organizer of the hike, says that it is the citizens who are to blame for the pollution.
"The main source is the beach visitors themselves, since more than half of the total number of waste is plastic, various waste, starting with bags, plastic pieces, which are already in the stage of degradation, they can no longer be identified in Ul, and in fumes, bottles", cork
Among the dirtiest beaches there are also bathing places in Riga.
For example, in Daugavgr<0xC4><0xAB>, almost 800 waste units are collected on average every hundred meters, which is a critical amount.
The organizers of the campaign also explain that almost every step of the way also smoke and not everywhere placed warning or ban signs.
"The average figures for all three Riga bathing sites - Daugavgr<0xC4><0xAB>va, Vakarbul<0xC4><0xBC>i and Vet<0xC4><0x81><0xC4><0xB7>i - unfortunately meet large and far exceed the desired or goal, which Latvia is moving towards, to reduce the number of waste units to 135 units by 2020," concludes the environmental defender.
Cleanliness of bathing areas in Riga every day, on the hottest days of the summer, even twice, explains the representative of the city council Ugis Vidauskis.
However, the fight against dirty visitors is quite difficult.
We come back to the question of these people's culture.
"With those who fertilize, use alcohol, smoke and do all the things that should not be done, even special signs do not work," says Vidauskis.
Therefore, Vidauskis invites visitors to the bathing area to report pollutants to the police.
You can call the police, safely point to these violations and thus fight everyone.
Perhaps some new warnings can be imposed, but, as I said, it will hardly radically change the situation.
"As everyone should simply turn to and be intolerant of such offenders together," he emphasizes.
In the meantime, measurements of water quality have already been made for the fourth time this summer by the Health Inspectorate, which can impose a ban on official bathing sites.
This year, as in other years, the water quality is good and satisfactory everywhere.
At present, the situation is that in all 56 bathing areas the water quality has always been good and there are no bathing restrictions.
“For the last time, we will take the analysis at the end of August,” says Normunds Kadi<0xC4><0xB7>is, Senior Environmental Health Specialist of the Inspection.
During heavy rainfall, waste left on land can be rinsed in water.
This, in turn, can affect its quality, according to an environmental specialist.
Rotations in the Russian elite continue - the change of the leader in the Putin administration.
You're a craftsman yourself?
Vladimir Putin told the Russian media that Sergey Ivanov wanted to leave this post himself and will be the president's special representative on nature protection, ecology and transport in the future.
In announcing the changes, Putin paid tribute to Ivanov in front of the television camera: "Dear Sergei Borisovich, we have been working with you for many years and we are doing it successfully."
I am pleased with the way in which you have discharged the duties entrusted to you.
I remember well our agreement not to use you as head of the Presidential Administration for more than four years.
That is why I am sympathetic to your desire to change the field of action.
And I hope that you will make full use of your knowledge and experience in your new position as well.
However, it is emphasized that the leadership of the presidential administration is a very important position and this made Ivanov one of the most influential people in the country.
With the forthcoming elections to the State Council in Russia next month, rumours have surfaced that this step is linked to the struggle for power in the Russian political elite.
Ivanov has also been called a possible replacement for Putin as president, so the claim that he himself wanted to take the office of the president's representative in matters of nature protection and transport has raised doubts.
According to the archives of Lsm.lv, Ivanovs is the Commander-in-Chief of the VDK and the Federal Security Service.
Ivanov was a sensible and close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He started his career in special services in 1975, where he met Putin.
Later, when Putin became the head of the Federal Security Service, Ivanov became his deputy.
In turn, at the end of the reign of the first Russian President Boris Yeltsin was appointed Secretary of the Russian Security Council.
In 2000, after Putin came to power, the "Doctrine of Information Security" developed by Ivanov was approved, which included in Russia the revival of state censorship mechanisms.
In 2001, Sergey Ivanov became the Minister of Defense of Russia, but in 2005 - as a deputy of Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov and was responsible for the development of Russian defense companies and arms exports.
Now, after the resignation of the head of the presidential administration, Ivanov will also retain a place in the Russian National Security Council, where the new head of the presidential administration Vaino will also work.
The blame comes from the elite of the family soviet party.
The position of head of the administration of the President Vaino was recommended by Ivanov himself.
Anton Eduardovich and I have known each other for a long time.
From the time we worked in government under your leadership.
And for the past almost five years, we've been communicating practically every day.
"Therefore, I am convinced that, according to all the professional and personal qualities of his character, he is ready for this work," Ivanovs said.
Guilt comes from a family that belonged to the elite of the Soviet party.
His grandfather Charles held high positions in the Estonian Communist Party, including ten years until 1988, when he was its first secretary.
The Internet publication "Meduza" with reference to the book "Estonia's Self-Determination and Independence" writes that Karl Vaino asked Moscow to give permission to use force against the participants of the demonstrations at the end of the 1980s.
However, he was resigned and soon lost his post.
Shortly thereafter, Vaino moved to live in Moscow.
Anton Vaino is a graduate of the Moscow Institute of International Relations and manages the Japanese language.
However, he has left the diplomatic service to work in the administration of the President's Protocol.
It has already been reported that in recent weeks, Russia has been rocked by the dismissal and even arrests of several high-ranking officials, including the replacement of governors and federal representatives of several districts.
According to political scientists, President Vladimir Putin is reshaping the ruling elite before the upcoming elections in 2018.
One of the main features - more and more often at the top positions are representatives of power structures.
Judo fighter Nikiforenko also loses in the first battle of the Olympic Games.
This was the fight in the first round, and the Latvian judo fighter has finished his participation in the Olympic Games, finishing in 17th place.
If you are a member of the European Union, you will be able to use your personal data for the purposes set out in this Regulation.
He also discovered that the judo fighter suffered a shoulder injury in the fight.
Significantly, in order to get to the Olympic track, Nikiforenko had to start in a different weight category than usual - namely, in the weight category up to 100 kilograms.
The Azerbaijani fighter was 25 kilograms heavier.
It has already been reported that Yevgeny Borodavko fought in the weight category up to 100 kilograms against Rjunosuki for two and a half minutes, until the opponent managed a pure victory worth a shot.
So, the Latvian judo competition in Rio is over.
Dreams disappear in the sand of Rio.
Thursday was introduced by Judith Yevgeny Borodavko.
Yes, he had a more titled opponent, but ambitious people can sometimes surprise him.
He didn't produce.
For Arthur Nikiforenko, the task was even more difficult, because the experience is less and the opponent is also respectable.
The result is similar, although on the tatami he held for almost a minute and a half longer than Borodavko.
Unfortunately, lately Latvian judiciaries have been lacking the most ambition.
Since the leadership of the federation passed by Gunars Kirson and his financial supporter Vladimir <0xC5><0xA0>estakov, Alexander Jackevi<0xC4><0x8D>s left Latvia, "Golden Score" is no longer happening - judo development is on a downward curve.
For Jackevi<0xC4><0x8D>, who advises the judiciary of Kazakhstan here, and for Vsevold Ze<0xC5><0x82>oni, there are no heirs.
But if you don't grow up, you won't.
This is the federation’s prerogative.
Therefore, the promise of the President of the Judo Federation of Latvia to fight medals sounded from another galaxy in the Morning Panorama.
Flying away from reality.
In the evening with impatience and worries we were waiting for the beach volleyball match Samoilovs / <0xC5><0xA0>medi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> - Evandra / Pedro Solbergs.
Intrigue as already in the "death" group - losers games ended.
You can also use the following methods to calculate the amount of money you spend on your business:
The tension increased even longer in the previous game.
No one wanted to die - this feeling over the wind card spins the entire length of the match.
For the players, the turbulent wind created additional difficulties.
At first it seemed that it might be our - which is the most comprehensive - ally.
But it didn't.
It was quite simple to play against the Latvian duo here.
Serve so on Samoilovu and wait for him to rip.
In the end of the first set and in the third start, the Cubans broke up against Canada, because the load was not a joke.
At that time, the snail could fish, because there was little work, but when there was, he did it with honor.
If you are a member of the European Union, you will be able to use your personal data in accordance with the provisions of the European Union’s legal framework.
But he could also lose by 0:2, because in the second set the deficit was -4, however, even thanks to the wind, he managed to win.
The third was already in the servile mark of Evandra.
The chain was formed - unconvincingly captured serve, the second addition often flies too close to the network and Samoilov left very few options for a successful attack.
If there was a foreigner Samoilov against the Cubans on the field, then this time he acted more successfully, and only the loss of Sasha would be unprofessional.
Also, Kreilis was wrong, and quite symbolically, that the last ball in the block was hit by him.
The team is losing.
This time there was definitely a lack of success - in the third set only two Evandra attacks almost flew out of the card, but the ball still hit the line.
Two lanes were next to the line.
Also, the contentious episodes of the video decided in favor of the opponents.
If in the first two games Evandra was battling with servies, then against us they were very productive.
All together amounted to a loss on the board.
The causes of failure must now be calmly analysed.
Perhaps, like many, they should have lived next door to the stadium, not with a delegation to the Olympic Village.
It took two and a half hours on the road.
Perhaps a little self-confidence gave to the seven semi-final series.
Perhaps you should not have played in Klagenfurt, but to get here faster and better acclimatize.
Perhaps there was a failure in finding the top of the sporty form.
For the time being, more questions than answers.
We're out of games for the bastards.
The dream of medals is over.
What's next?
There are still some World Cup tournaments and also Jurmala "Masters".
The snitch with Samoilov has never been friends in life and will not be, because there are too different personalities.
But it is also not necessary.
When the dream of the Olympic medals has fallen, the thought of a divorce can also arise, because the blame will be sought not only for yourself, but also for your partner.
It is not difficult to decide, but it will be much harder in Latvia to find a worthy partner.
Both brothers play bulls, but Ian and Tom have already tried and also parted ways, while Mikhail Samoilov is still too green to start conquering the world's tops.
You can try Harald Reggae, Alexander Solovej, Edgar Toch, to return to Martini<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> Plavi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>, but it will not be better than this option, which proved itself many times in the World Cup stages.
The sand of Kopakabana did not make them smile this time.
Yeah, sure.
Of course, it should also be taken into account that beach volleyball is becoming more popular, new pairs enter the circuit, and only a rare height is less than two meters.
This does not guarantee success yet, but is an essential argument in the fight for victory.
Our longer ones don't last.
Both athletes and journalists have the opportunity to stay in the places offered by the game organizers, as well as to choose their own.
The U.S. basketball team lives on a cruise ship, some of the tennis players do not stay in the Olympic village.
Also, some beach volleyball players have found a hotel in Kopakaban.
This time, the prices of very modest accommodations were heavily exaggerated for the journalists who offered them.
Therefore, the choice also fell on the apartment rental.
The risk is, because sometimes they can be uncomfortable from a logistical point of view.
This time the risk is justified.
Together with Vladimir Vladimirovich we rent apartments on the border of Kopakabana and Ipanema.
The beach is 200 meters away, a half-hour walk from the beach arena.
The area is quite safe, because the favela path, however, the vigilance should not be lost here too.
Vladimir Vladimirovich is not what some immediately imagine, but the most professional sports journalist in the Russian media Vladimir Ivanov.
P.S. It looks like another medal dream was dreamed out on Friday morning.
Laura Ikauniece-Admid<0xC4><0xAB><0xC5><0x86>a was behind her personal records in the 100 metres barrier race and climbing.
But there are still five disciplines.
After 10 years of break "Porgijs and Besa" sounds in Liepaja.
In Latvia, the opera "Porgijs and Besa" premiered at the Latvian National Opera in 1973.
Since then, the internationally recognized masterpiece has not been re-enacted.
It is for this reason that the organizers of the C<0xC4><0x93>sis Art Festival and Liep<0xC4><0x81>ja Art Forum have decided in close cooperation to give the listeners the opportunity to enjoy Georges G<0xC4><0x93>r<0xC5><0xA1>vinas <0xC5><0xA1>edervus.
"We are very pleased that after a ten-year break, when Liepaja was able to enjoy the performance of the opera for the last time, this excellent version of the performance of the opera "Porgijs and Bessa" by George Guer<0xC5><0xA1>vina is available in the new, newly opened concert hall "Little Gin".
The opera "Porgius and Besa" is a story of love, its volatility, passion, as well as domestic tragedies and simple everyday pleasures told in bright musical language.
It reflects African-American vitality, music, and rhythm.
It is precisely this lack of political correctness in this opera, this exclusion of tolerance that makes it so vivid.
"And yes, this love story is extremely powerful, extremely beautiful and in some way really profound," says director Viesturs Kairiss.
What I like the most - when listening to or playing this opera, there are always such stops - famous melodies, famous motifs, but these transitions from one character to another, illuminating one character or another character, or choir, or orchestra.
"This is the most exciting building", the opera is appreciated by the musical director and conductor Andris Poga of the opera "Porgijs and Besa".
Visitors to the opera agree that this is a grand event.
They are thrilled to hear the world-famous Goerschwin opera.
It is good that you can feel the breath of the world in Liepaja.
"The performance is professional", the opera is appreciated by the visitor Edgars Lams.
The concert idea was special in that in the newly opened concert hall "The Great Amber" for the first time an orchestra played in the orchestra pit and for the first time an opera concert performance took place.
The renovated building at the Museum of Art could be named after Jan Rozental.
At the opening of the anniversary exhibition of Riga Deputy Mayor Andris Ameriks Rozentals announced that in the future the museum’s own address could be not Kri<0xC5><0xA1>j<0xC4><0x81>nis Valdem<0xC4><0x81>ras street 10a, but Janis Rozentals square 1.
The director of the museum, M<0xC4><0x81>ra L<0xC4><0x81>ce, acknowledged that the re-registration of the address will result in a considerable bureaucratic burden, but in general, this idea is welcomed and therefore accepted the proposal of the municipality.
The city of Riga laid a kind of foundation stone for this idea in 1936, creating the Burkard Dzen monument to Janim Rozental, which stands next to the museum.
The then director of the museum, Wilhelm Purv<0xC4><0xAB>tis, was one of the initiators of the construction of this monument.
In this way, this further action could be purely logical.
I always have a little bit of a broken conscience - but Wilhelm Purv<0xC4><0xAB>tis, where will we put his name?
"But if you, Mr. America, promise to think," said the Bear.
It is reported that the building of the National Museum of Art, after an ambitious reconstruction and modernization, officially opened its doors in May this year.
This week the reconstruction of the VEF Palace of Culture will finally begin.
You have to pay about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11 million for the restoration of SIA "Velve".
It is planned to renovate several rooms of the castle, including two spectator halls, as well as to adapt the building to people with disabilities.
The Riga City Council intends to raise EUR 6 million of European Union funds for the project, but the Director of the Property Department of the Riga City Council O<0xC4><0xBC>egs Burovs admits that for the time being there is still no complete clarity on European funds for the project.
"Despite the political will to start repairs to the VEF Cultural Palace by attracting European Structural Funds, there is, for months we are waiting for a decision, real action from the officials of the Ministry of Finance, whether its money will be allocated or not," says Burovs.
Last December, we were told that everything depends on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission to decide for itself that Brussels does not take a decision here.
At the moment, we see another round of discussions forming again, well, then we will see what we can expect in the coming days.
“I have to say that the Riga City Council undoubtedly guarantees that this process will be started and completed within the deadlines,” Burovs said.
It has already been reported that more than a year ago, in March 2015, VEF Palace of Culture collectively organized a farewell concert before the immediate, immediate renovation of the building.
Although the year had passed, the renovation of the building was still not started and collectively continued to work in unsuitable conditions.
In the strategy of the Riga City Council Property Department, the renovation of the VEF Cultural Palace is divided into apparently independent sets of reconstruction works, where each will provide for the implementation of different functions of the castle.
The first is to increase the accessibility of the VEF Palace of Culture and improve the surrounding area.
It is intended to arrange the surroundings and engineering communications, as well as to restore the facade of the building.
The second is to improve the services offered by the VEF Palace of Culture.
It plans to restore the interior, walls and ceilings of the building, improve the studio of the stage and sound recordings, as well as arrange the internal engineering communications of the building.
Third - Improving the working conditions of creative amateur collectives, which includes plans to improve workshop equipment, space heating and ventilation systems.
Before the 40th anniversary of "L<0xC4><0xAB>vu" legendary rock band can be seen in the exhibition in Liep<0xC4><0x81>ja.
The exhibition will show a variety of objects that characterize "Livas" - photographs arranged in a timeline to reflect the group's activities from the beginning until 2010, when the end of the group's activities is announced.
The participants’ stage costumes, musical instruments, awards and concert recordings will also be shown, as well as other things that have not yet been seen by the general public, reflecting the creative activities of the group "Liva".
The exhibition will be supplemented with items from the collection of the Liepaja Museum.
The visual design of the exhibition was made in collaboration with the fashion artist and painter Elita Patmalnieci.
Also the musicians, who were associated with the group "Liv" and their relatives, responded to the invitation and shared both objects and memories.
The beginnings of "Liva" can be traced back to 1972, when a vocal instrumental ensemble, led by Juris Pavitols, was created at the Liepaja House of Culture.
The ensemble in its original composition participated in the festival "Liepaja Amber" in 1972 and 1974, as well as in the city and republic.
In 1976, a fateful meeting took place when Juris Pav<0xC4><0xAB>tols met Erika <0xC4><0xB6>i<0xC4><0xBC>eli and founded a group at the Metallurgi Culture Palace, inviting Ingrida Gutmani, Andri Kr<0xC5><0xAB>zi<0xC5><0x86>a and J<0xC4><0x81>ni Grodumu to join.
Over the years, the composition of the group has taken place more than once.
Participants have joined, others have gone their way, some have returned.
However, the main thing - the desire to prove that Latvian rock music is capable of living and existing - has remained unchanged.
"What was missing - jeans, hair and beards, these boys were markedly different from the stereotype of the generally accepted singer of the performance", says music observer Klass V<0xC4><0x81>vere.
In the group without the above mentioned musicians, such outstanding musicians as Igo, Vilnis Krievi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>, Modris <0xC5><0xA0>terns, Valdis <0xC5><0xA0>tarks, Laimis R<0xC4><0x81>cen<0xC4><0x81>js, T<0xC4><0x81>lis Pusbarnieks, Ainars Virga, Aivars Br<0xC4><0xAB>ze, Guntars Mucenieks, Dainis Virga, Tomas Kleins and many more.
Entrance to the exhibition free of charge.
The exhibition can be viewed from 19 August to 30 October.
On the other hand, on August 27 in the concert garden of Liepaja "P<0xC5><0xAB>t, v<0xC4><0x93>j<0xC4><0xAB><0xC5><0x86>i" will be held the group "L<0xC4><0xAB>vi" 40th anniversary celebration "L<0xC4><0xAA>VIfest 2".
For the first time in 8 months, inflation is observed in Bulgaria.
In July, Bulgaria’s national statistics showed 1% monthly inflation.
This is the highest since 2012 and the first indicator above zero since October of the previous year when it was positive (0.2%).
The average annual inflation after PCI in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) was -0.8% compared to the previous year.
The consumer price index in July 2016 was 101.9% compared to the previous year and the average monthly inflation was 1.0%.
Since the beginning of the year, the inflation rate was -0.2% (in July 2016 compared to December 2015) and annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016 there was an increase in prices for the following groups of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); entertainment and cultural activities (6.3%); hotels and restaurants (1.2%); household goods and services0.
Prices fell for clothing and footwear (2.2%); for home appliances, household appliances and regular house cleaning (0.5%); for health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the level of the previous month for alcohol and tobacco, management, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Zbig<0xC5><0x86>evs Stankevi<0xC4><0x8D>s: The time is coming, and the truth is coming.
The archbishop of the Latvian Catholic Church, Metropolitan Zbigniew Stankevi<0xC4><0x8D>s, in an interview with the Independent emphasizes that if we want to gain strength for life, we must put the Gospel message at the center of it.
For the power of truth is greater than the power of evil and wickedness.
Many are already on their way to the Feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Aglona.
What message will believers receive there this year?
In recent years, the will to lead the main worship in Aglona has been expressed by the pope's nuncio.
Therefore, the content of the main message is also in its own right.
A kind of tradition is also the fact that the path of the Cross is led by Bishop J<0xC4><0x81>nis Bulis.
He will also make his own message.
On the previous day, I led the celebration of the Vigil service.
Last year, I addressed Pope Francis's encyclical "Laudato si" and updated the common house, the theme of the Earth in the context of Latvia.
This year, of course, I’m watching what’s going on in the world, and I’m trying to respond to it in my speech.
My approach coincides with the Church’s recommendation that the Gospel message should be placed at the centre of life.
It is necessary to show that the Gospel responds to the most painful problems of human life and gives him inspiration for a further journey.
Then it speaks to people.
But in C<0xC4><0x93>sis, in the Lampa discussion, you said that "it is necessary to return to the understanding of the full man".
What do you mean by that?
Does this mean that a person turns away from the message of the church?
And does the church today have such a resource of return?
In the capital of India, a man is lying dead on the side of the road.
In the Indian capital, no one has lied or known about a man who was killed on the side of the road - it turns out that he had spent an hour on the side of the road and then still robbed, the BBC reports.
It has been reported that a man identified as Matiboul traveled with a rickshaw during the day, but worked as a guard at night.
Matthew 5:30 in the morning drove home on the road when he was hit by a light car.
The surveillance camera record shows that the driver got out of the car to look at the victim, and then left.
After an hour, when no one knew about the bleeding man, he was robbed by a duckling.
About 90 minutes after the incident, the police arrived and the victim was taken to the hospital, where he died of the injuries.
When recalling his candidacy for the position of Director-General of the State Revenue Service (VID), Inga Ko<0xC4><0xBC>egova, Head of the State Environment Service, saved the government from falling, believes Associate Professor Oj<0xC4><0x81>rs Skudra of the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Latvia.
The explanation of Kolegova about the withdrawal of the candidacy in connection with the contradictions in the ruling coalition is related to the fact that she prevented the collapse of the government.
In a conversation with the agency LETA, Skudra said that it is difficult for him to imagine that next week in the government meeting "Unity" would support the candidacy of Kolegova.
Therefore, if the Ministers of "Unity" voted against, but Ko<0xC4><0xBC>egov was approved in office anyway, it would lead to the resignation of the government.
The expert also believes that Ko<0xC4><0xBC>egova has consulted both Dana Reisnieci-Ozola, Minister of Finance, and M<0xC4><0x81>ri Ku<0xC4><0x8D>inski, Prime Minister, before announcing the withdrawal of the candidacy.
At the same time, it was also a surrender to "Unity", which strongly opposed her candidacy.
When predicting whether to find a suitable candidate with the help of the competition, Skudra acknowledged that there are two options - either a compromise figure will be chosen, or the institution will continue to lead Dace Grey as the executor of the responsibilities of the Director-General.
At the same time, he points out that if the Minister of Finance has so far claimed that no other candidacy is being considered, it would be a hint to Greykay that he should not take part in the competition.
LETA has already announced that the head of the State Environmental Service, Ko<0xC4><0xBC>egova, has decided to withdraw his candidacy for the post of Director General of the VID.
In addition, it is important to note that the use of this product is not limited to the use of the product in the first place.
After the government's decision to postpone the decision, Ko<0xC4><0xBC>egova confirmed that she was still ready to become the head of the VID.
However, she later changed her mind - in a Friday submission to the Minister of Finance Dana Reisniece-Ozola she states that she withdraws her consent to transfer to the post of Head of the VID and this is not an easy choice for her.
Andrejs Vaivars, press secretary of Prime Minister M<0xC4><0x81>ras Ku<0xC4><0x8D>inskas, explained to LETA that a new competition will be held for the vacant post of Director General of VID.
In the center of Riga, there was an accident involving a police car.
In the center of Riga this afternoon there was a road accident involving a State Police car.
The police car with the sound and light signals turned on rushed to the call of the highest category, until it collided with another car at the crossroads of Kri<0xC5><0xA1>j<0xC4><0x81>nis Barona and Dzirnavu Street.
The police explain the circumstances, but the initial information indicates that the second force did not miss the police car.
A woman was injured in the accident.
This year, the population of Riga has fallen.
At the beginning of this year, there were 638,784 inhabitants in Riga, which is 0.34% less than in 2015, when 641 000 people were officially registered in the capital, the agency LETA informed the Central Statistical Office (CSP).
In terms of population, the capital of Latvia ranks 30th among the capitals of the European Union (EU) countries and major cities with more than one million inhabitants.
According to the data of the EU statistics office "Eurostat" in Riga is the largest proportion of women - the capital of Latvia is confidently in the first place among the largest cities in Europe with 127 women per 100 men.
In all three capitals of the Baltic States, there is the highest proportion of women in Europe's largest cities: in Vilnius there are 123, while in Tallinn there are 121 women per 100 men.
A warning pictogram shall be placed at the LNMM.
In the coming days, warning signs - pictograms - will be placed at the Latvian National Museum of Art (LNMM), the representative of the Property Department of the Riga City Council, Baiba Gail<0xC4><0xAB>te, told the agency LETA.
At the moment, the repair of the damage to the museum's glass-enamelled sodium has been successfully completed, which had been the result of the operation of the skateboarders.
In the coming days, warning pictograms will be placed next to it.
Its inhabitants will be told that the cover tends to be sleek during rain and snow, it should not be moved by cars, as well as visiting bicycles, roller skates and skateboards.
If you are a member of the European Union, you will not be able to use your personal data in any way, but you will be able to use your personal data for the purposes of this Agreement.
Holidays for children and parents - new children's playgrounds have been set up in Riga.
This summer, the Riga Municipality has installed two more new playgrounds in the city, Kipsala and <0xC4><0x8C>iekurkalns, which are already available for children.
A wide, multifunctional toy ship with various climbing elements, bridges, games, pipes and slides is installed on the beach of Kipsala.
The playground is designed for children of all ages.
Swings and various balancing elements are also installed in the field.
The world of fantasy for small sailors is highlighted by the location of the attraction on the coast of Daugava with a view of the passenger port and the cruise ships visible there.
In turn, in the playground between the 4th and 5th cross-line of <0xC4><0x8C>iekurkalns, there is a playhouse, a trampoline, a rung track, a balance bridge, swings, playing balls and other game elements, as well as a gymnastics area with rings for strength and coordination training, sports, etc.
Under the field covered rubber cover in different colors.
A new, colourful pavement covering is placed next to the playground from the street side.
The reconstructed section of the road has been discovered in the hounds.
Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis, Head of the Latvian State Roads Administration (LVC), as well as representatives of the builders of Binders Ltd. and the local authorities today unveiled the reconstructed main road border of Russia (Grebnev) -R<0xC4><0x93>zekne-Daugavpils-Liedu.
Roads are a national business card, especially border roads, so it is a special pleasure to discover a reconstructed stage on the border with our southern neighbors.
This is another example of the fact that, thanks to the co-financing of European Union funds, the situation on the national main roads is improving.
"As the forecasts show, the funds available for roads during this planning period will be acquired already in 2018, and we need to think about how to continue to maintain the most congested roads in very good quality, and also to ensure the mobility of citizens in all regions of Latvia without European Union funding," said Ulras.
The Minister of Transport also pointed out that the proposals prepared by traffic experts on sustainable financing for Latvian roads will be presented in the government in the near future.
Construction works on the stage from Medjugorje to the Lithuanian border (156,4-163,05 km) SIA Binders started last year and this year they continued after a technological break.
The cost of reconstruction is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>13.5 million (including VAT), a project co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
"In the reconstructed phase of the road, the road construction has been completely restored and next year repairs will be started in the next phase from Medjugorje to Daugavpils itself, thus arranging the entire road from the Lithuanian border to Daugavpils," said J<0xC4><0x81>nis Lange, Chairman of the LVC Board.
The main roads of the country are the most crowded, and by 2018 we plan to ensure that all the main roads of the country are in good condition.
The next task will be to maintain them in good quality, ensuring periodic maintenance in a timely manner and to carry out the replacement of the asphalt surface every 7-9 years.
"It will, of course, require adequate funding, and all travellers look forward to the proposals developed by the expert group for arranging the road financing system," Lange said.
Within the framework of the project, road connections and lighting in the center of Medumu have been arranged.
Significant earthworks were carried out: large-scale reclamation in four stages and extensive digging and embankment work, the road length profile, which was very uneven until now, was leveled.
Public transport stops have also been restored and a turnaround area for public transport has been re-built.
Previously, the road had insufficient carrying capacity and the terrain was intransparent due to the mountainous valleys, as well as the old road common terrain.
In the next construction season, it is planned to renovate the section of the highway from the city border of Daugavpils to the reconstructed section (144.80.-156.40. km).
This year LVC plans to carry out various types of work on more than 1100 kilometers of national roads.
Information on all repairs planned this year in the national road network is available on the LVC website www.lvceli.lv.
"To achieve the desired weight loss results, it is very important to choose the right food combinations," admits Lithuanian dietitian Laura Romeraite-Kuklieriene.
In addition, it is easy to make during the summer period, when fresh fruits, berries and vegetables grow in our own gardens.
The combination of thoughtful diet products can help not only reduce excess weight, but also purposefully promote various processes in the body.
Pasta and vinegar are a successful combination because they provide a lasting feeling of satiety and help fight against fat.
Studies published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition have shown that vinegar has a beneficial effect on blood glucose levels and helps us feel sluggish.
Cajun pepper and protein-rich food, such as poultry meat or a protein cocktail, not only creates a feeling of fullness, but also reduces the craving for large meals in the next meals.
The combination of these foods can also increase the amount of calories burned after a meal by up to 35%.
Studies show that cayenne peppers can help get rid of the fat deposits in the belly area.
Eggs contain a metabolic-promoting nutrient - choline, while paprika is a good source of vitamin C.
Consuming a sufficient amount of this nutrient can reduce cortisol levels, thus also the accumulation of fat around the middle of the body.
Oatmeal porridge, with fresh berries added, is another delicious and fat-burning meal for breakfast, which is worth including in your menu.
Oat flakes and berries contain fiber, which according to Canadian scientists control ghrelin - an appetite-stimulating hormone - and thus a feeling of hunger.
In addition, berries contain polyphenols, which are helpful in weight reduction, and also do not allow fat to form.
Vegetables and proteins also have the ability to do wonders in weight reduction.
This combination is able to create a feeling of satiety.
Vegetables contain water and fiber, so contribute to the feeling of satiety.
At the same time, proteins slow down the process of digestion and provide a feeling of fullness for a longer time.
At lunch, you can eat chicken with salads or cook a protein cocktail from the ready-made mixture and enjoy it together with your favorite vegetables.
What combinations of products to avoid.
Fruits contain sugars - monosaccharides or disaccharides - compounds of one or two molecules.
In contrast, the starch found in vegetables is polysaccharide.
Fruits are broken down in the stomach mechanically, while chemically they do not mature until they reach the third or fourth degree of the digestive process that occurs in the intestines.
The starch is divided into three different stages, which begin already in the mouth.
Therefore, it is important not to eat sweet food immediately after a meal.
When eating a sweet meal immediately after a meal, it is "clogged" in the stomach along with other dishes, where it is not chemically digested and begins to swell.
Do not eat bread, potatoes, peas, bananas, dates or other carbohydrate-containing products together with lemons, lemons, oranges, grapefruits, pineapples or other acidic fruits.
The enzyme ptyalin, which is found in saliva, acts only in alkaline environments.
Fruit acids inhibit not only the digestion of carbohydrates, but also promote their fermentation.
Do not eat eggs and meat, nuts and meat, cheese and eggs or cheese and nuts, meat and milk, eggs and milk or nuts and milk and a combination of protein-rich products.
To process them, you need different digestive juices, each of them with a different strength, characteristics and time to enter the stomach.
Watermelon, honeymelon, muscatmelon and other melons should always be eaten separately from other dishes.
Melons are not digested if they are found in the stomach along with other foods.
Fats in combination with protein-rich products.
Fats form a successful combination with starch, however, the same can not be said about fats and proteins - fats inhibit the digestion of proteins.
Proteins can be combined with a very small amount of fat.
When consuming a large amount of protein-containing products, avoid consuming fat altogether.
This also applies to refreshment - it is not recommended to combine a large amount of nuts (containing protein) with a whole avocado (containing fat).
Such a combination prevents effective weight reduction.
How to cook better?
"Food preparation, heat treatment leads to a significant loss of nutrients - about 15% to 55% of the initial nutrient composition of the products," says the dietitian.
In most cases, nutrients are lost when cooking foods in water.
However, the nutritional value of some foods increases when cooked directly.
After boiling vegetables, it is recommended to use the remaining liquid for the preparation of the soup - in this case, you will not lose any nutrients left in the water, and you will be able to eat them later.
Vegetables are recommended to be cooked, also by steaming them.
Heat treatment significantly increases the bioavailability of the lycopene contained in tomatoes.
When cooking tomatoes for 30 minutes, the amount of lycopene increases by 25%.
Thermal treatment also significantly increases the bioavailability of beta-carotene found in red, yellow, orange plants such as tomatoes, carrots, sweet potatoes and spinach.
The heat treatment of eggs and meat takes away the natural properties of the proteins in them, making them easier to digest.
The heat treatment of meat and eggs also makes the iron and other minerals contained in these products more easily absorbed by the body.
It should also be borne in mind that the freezing of products can reduce the amount of vitamin C from 10% to up to 90%, but the freezing of fiber does not affect.
Beans in combination with tomatoes can increase the absorption of iron in the body, which in turn provides better brain and muscle function.
Our body absorbs up to 33% less non-bleeding iron found in plant products such as beans, leafy greens, cereal products than blood-producing iron found in animal products such as beef, fish and chicken.
You can significantly increase the absorption of non-bleeding iron in the body by consuming non-bleeding iron-containing products along with vitamin C sources such as oranges, tomatoes and berries.
Vitamin C helps to change non-blood-forming iron so that it is more easily absorbed by our body.
Iron is needed for the production of hemoglobin, which provides oxygen for the muscles and brain.
To get the maximum benefit from salads, add healthy fats, such as olive or linseed oil, to them.
When cooking sandwiches with salmon, add vitamin D-rich salmon or sardines to the added yogurt, which is a good source of calcium.
Vitamin D increases the amount of calcium absorbed by the intestines and plays an important role in the process of bone formation.
Oats (as well as other whole grain products) along with sources of vitamin C, such as strawberries, raisins, raspberries and other fruits or berries, help stabilize cholesterol levels as well as prevent arterial clogging.
Snapchat "Anime" effect is criticized for Asian caricature
Snapchat representatives say that this filter was inspired by the animation, but some commentators claim that it is racist insensitive.
With this lens effect, Snapchat allows 150 million daily users to change reality in a completely absurd way and play with their identity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or an image that fits into the painting of Roy Lichtenstein.
Lenses are misty, image-distorting tools that generate more than 30 million transformed selfies per day.
Any mistake is quickly becoming visible in the public eye.
Snapchat’s lens effects have been criticized in the past for getting the hint that the app promotes too blackened or light facial skin tones as an ideal beauty benchmark.
This week, new lens effects were published that allow users to build fish eyes, fish teeth and round cheeks, and some critics called it a racist Asian caricature – the “yellow gimmick”.
The question was also raised as to whether such contradictions do not indicate that the company has greater problems with diversity.
News and public denials erupted on Wednesday when publications The Verge and Motherboard announced that the lens effects had been removed from the app.
The company explained that the objective of the lens is to depict the images of Anime, not to caricature people of Asian origin.
However, for people who have experienced racism, these effects reminded them of painful stereotypes.
Others categorically denied the similarity to Anime.
Korean-born American art student Greisa Sparapani's Twitter entry about the images gained wide resonance. In an email she states that the lens effects were "excusing and uncomfortable not to say more".
She added that it is difficult not to notice the obvious similarity between Asian cartoons and lens effects.
This shows that the lens effect is not just a yellow face, but a yellow face in the sense of racism.
Snapchat is not the only company that has fallen into these cultural traps.
American culture is also engaged in a never-ending struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices we use on a daily basis.
And Snapchat's large youth audience, representing different races, unlike the older population, is more sensitive to such things.
If Snapchat lenses create an image that offends users, then "today such things do not go unnoticed," 25-year-old Katey Zhou said in an interview Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhou, the product manager at Medium, deleted his Snapchat app and advised others to do the same.
In her article on "Medium" and in a telephone interview, she explained that in her opinion, race-related problems arise because of Snapchat's employment policy, which does not sufficiently support racial diversity.
Zhou criticized the management of the company, which consists mainly of white men, and then concluded his article with the reference #DeleteSnapchat.
"This means that there is no racial diversity in the company, which is why such decisions are made. Do some other racial representatives work in the company, but they do not take up such a position so that they can safely and conveniently express their opinion," believes the Chinese-American Zhou.
While others agree with her view, Snapchat has not responded to her complaint.
The company does not disclose how many employees are represented by different races, indicating that it is a private company.
Snapchat refused to discuss the origins of its employees, but its representative revealed that the company has hired a staff specialist who will focus on also representing racial minorities in the company, who are not widely represented and will promote inclusion in the company.
Zhou, on the other hand, will not renew his Snapchat account, adding, "Interestingly, do they really need more users like us to understand that this is not correct."
The House of Congress announces that military officials have distorted reports about the Islamic State.
In a statement issued Thursday, the House of Congress said that U.S. Central Command officials have distorted the reports, portraying the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria much more optimistic than it actually is.
Analysts of the Central Command Intelligence Service express general dissatisfaction with the interim report of the task force of representatives of the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Defence Finance Subcommittee, which was set up by the Republicans, indicating that their leadership controlled the counter-reports on the US.
The Central Command, known as Centcom, is a military base in Tampa, Florida, overseeing U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest news about this report reports that intelligence reports, endorsed by senior Centcom executives, reflect the U.S. fight against terrorism more positively than it actually is. The facts were regularly distorted, showing better achievements than other analytes show
California Republican Representative Ken Calvert says, "Centcom's actions are unacceptable - our soldiers are the ones who suffer if our policymakers receive false reports."
Centcom's management errors are sought in the top management of the organization.
This 10-page report details the existing problems in the Central Command’s reflection and analysis of the US efforts to prepare Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While this does not provide infallible evidence that senior Obama administration officials would have corrupted the reports, it does show that Centcom’s management has put some pressure on analysts to portray a more optimistic view of the Islamic State (known as ISIL) or the Islamic State.
The report notes that in the first half of 2015, the Central Administration press releases, announcements and reports to Congress showed the situation in a much more positive light than it actually was.
For example, Centcom’s representatives publicly announced that the Mosul recovery operation could start as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul is the second largest city in Iraq, still under Islamic State control.
Representative of the Kansas Republican Party, Mike Pompeo, said in his report: "The investigation of several months clearly proves this."
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, U.S. Central Administration chiefs distorted reports, portraying ISIS threats in Iraq weaker than they actually were.
The Republican Party set up a task force, learning that analysts are concerned that information about the Islamic State is being distorted.
As the investigation continues, the report published on Thursday will be followed by new findings in this case.
The Inspector General of the Ministry of Defence conducts an investigation into the activities of the Centcom intelligence service.
Members of the Intelligence Steering Committee of the Democratic Party published their own report on Thursday, in which they agree with some of the conclusions of the Republican Working Group.
Representative of Democrats Adam B. Shif said in his report that from 2014 to 2015, Centcom had overly restricted the preparation of intelligence assessment reports in relation to ISIS and the Iraqi Security Forces.
Mr Shifa explains that this process "stopped the dissemination of information", worsened the work ethic of analysts and "distributed facts that were not in line with the truth."
But Shif and members of the Democratic Party added that there was no evidence that the White House had pressured Centcom analysts to draft reports, according to a "pre-determined or political stance."
The Daily Beast published the preliminary results of the congressional investigation on Thursday.
In August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon’s General Inspectorate had launched an investigation into complaints from Centcom analysts.
Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans said the Pentagon would not comment on the congressional report while the investigation continues.
He also added that experts sometimes interpret complex data differently, and the Ministry of Defence and the Intelligence Directorate called for a constructive dialogue on vital national security issues.
The investigation is not limited to the question of whether the US-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is successful (a claim made by more and more representatives of the Ministry of Defense).
But last year’s accusations cast doubt on whether President Obama can fully rely on reports from the Central Administration on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hotspots.
Criticisms of Islamic State intelligence are reminiscent of events more than a decade ago when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study claiming that the George W. Bush administration launched the Afghan war with too little thought of its possible consequences.
He also played an important role in the discovery of the Islamic State.
Last year, officials reported that Hooker's team revealed that, contrary to public reports, airstrikes on Islamic State oil mills did not significantly worsen the financial situation of the terrorist group in the market, as they had built temporary facilities.
In the September issue of The Times, it was reported that this discovery did not come outside the walls of the Central Administration.
At the time, General Lloyd Ostin III, the commander of Centcom, received harsh criticism, as many lawmakers felt that the reports of the war described the situation too positively.
In April, General Ostin took a leave of absence and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
In the U.S. women's field hockey duel with Great Britain, the U.S. wins, thus winning the fourth consecutive victory.
The day after the victory over Japan with a score of 6:1, on Thursday Keith Bama won the first two goals for the US women's field hockey team, when the Americans won the Indian team with a score of 3-0.
Five-goal wins in two games are an unforgettable achievement, but 27-year-old Bama said she couldn’t remember if she’d ever made it.
She said, "I have no idea."
I'm not one of those people who counts their own gates.
But she knows that the American result in the Olympics is 4:0, which gives them in their group a tie with Great Britain, which on Thursday after the victory over Japan with a score of 2:0 remained undefeated.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday to play the last match in the first round of the games.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals and the game will only determine which team will take the first place in the group of six teams and which one will be second.
The winner of the first place will be a little longer to avoid meeting with the strong Dutch team, who is the leader of the second group.
In addition to Saturday’s undeveloped game, the Americans have already called for a surprise storm, taking the last place among 12 teams in London four years ago.
There was also a Bama on that team.
She grew up in Bluebell, took the field hockey stick for the first time at the age of 3 (her older twin sisters were already involved in this sport in Dressel) and joined the national team when she was 16 years old, becoming the youngest player in the squad.
She didn't go to the 2008 Olympics because she didn't make it to the final.
However, 2012 was a bad year for her and her team.
The following year, Englishman Craig Parham was appointed as the head coach and everything changed to the right.
Bama called it "cultural, mental, and physical changes."
We did not invest as much work in London as we do now.
We have completely changed everything.
Thursday in the game Bama revealed the result, winning the goal in the first half with a rear shot from a close distance.
India started the game without a win on their account, but their squad was very fierce and kept a minimum score of 0:1 until the end of the third period, when Bama re-gained the goal.
She introduced the ball to the opponents' zone on the left side of the field, then noticed getting to the middle of the field and sending the ball to the opponents' goal, pushing the American 2-0 lead.
In the middle of the fourth period, Melis Gonzalez won another goal.
This was the first U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs dry game, in each of the first three games by invading one goal.
She's in a fight.
And so is Bama.
"We're doing very well right now," Paham said, "but just how well the game is going to show on Saturday.
The most depressing food of the depression period is the "saturated meal"
In March 1933, shortly after being elected president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in an oval room to hold a meal.
President Roosevelt enjoyed fine culinary delicacies such as goose liver paste or fuagra and Maryland turtle soup.
But on that day his meal was much more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato patties and dessert - plum pudding.
Jane Ziegelman says, "It's a way to stand in solidarity with people who have had a hard time."
Her husband Andrew Kou adds: "This is also a message for Americans how to eat."
A couple of the Brooklyn Heights district are food historians.
Kou’s last book, Vegetable Sauce, describes Chinese cuisine in America, but Ziegelmane’s book, 97 Abeles, describes life through a food rental house in the lower east of Manhattan.
Their new joint work, "Saturate Meal," to be published by Harper on Tuesday, is a story about American food during the Great Depression.
Showing some solidarity in the culinary world, they held a meal together with the reporter "Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop", a simple lunchroom located in the Flatiron district and operating since 1929, when the Great Depression began.
The 54-year-old Ziegelmane ordered a sandwich with melted cheese and chopped olives, while the 57-year-old Kou ordered turkey, potato patties and vegetable salads.
When the reporter ordered the fake rabbit, the couple admitted that his choice was very appropriate for a conversation about food during the Great Depression.
Mrs Ziegelmane said that the fake rabbit was very popular.
There was a peanut bunny, a liver bunny and a bean bunny.
They were prepared from the basic ingredient and various other ingredients that supplemented the meal.
Imagine how it is - to eat so many peanuts, so that they are in place for lunch.
Mr. Kou resigned.
"It probably seemed that the belly was full of lead," he added.
In the pre-depression years, the American lunch table resembled the Swedish table, especially in rural areas.
Women cooked for their husbands-workers and at breakfasts, lunches and dinners freshly cooked biscuits were served.
During the First World War, it was the Americans who sent food to Europeans. The "saturated meal" described how the Americans adapted to the conditions when America suddenly no longer had an abundance of land.
"At that time, food became the main focus of the American people's daily lives," Mr. Kou said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write directly on the subject.
Just as important became the new budget diets: unknown foods such as fake rabbits and stews became commonplace, stews were "a great way to use surpluses," noted Ms Ziegelmane, because chefs could hide the unattractive ingredients.
The fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit.
Meat, which for years was the main ingredient of American meals, has now become an extremely rare luxury product.
At a time when the number of calories and the nutritional value of food were more important than taste, new, unseen formations were born.
In an ancient cookbook, Mrs Ziegelmane found a recipe for making onions filled with peanut butter.
Mr Kou adds: "It was not a popular addition to the lunch table."
Ms Ziegelmane said: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and fried onion are not compatible.
Many homemade recipes applied to difficult times.
Household economists such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Economics for Households from 1923 to 1943, determined the eating habits of the state that were not experienced either before or after the Great Depression.
When publishing articles and recipes in newspapers and magazines, they recommended housewives to become "economists" and take on such challenges as turning pasta and carrot mixtures into a tasty meal.
"Saturated Meal" is a myelast of historical delights.
What is particularly interesting is the evidence of the government's attitude towards its starving citizens, such as the attitude of President Herbert Hoover 'let me eat cake'.
Although he publicly told about his simple childhood and eating in Iowa, he actually ate like the delicate millionaire he had become.
Mr Kou says: "He liked European cuisine, such as fish with cucumber sauce."
He ate in an almost gilded living room, wearing a lunch jacket.
He was completely detached from reality.
President Roosevelt would have made the same mistake if his wife Eleonora had not advised him to set an example by his eating habits.
The book tells us that Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who did not learn to cook, so the White House became a place "where not only was served one of the most distasteful dishes in Washington, but also the worst cooked dishes".
As the national economy receded, most of the culinary signatures of the depression era disappeared.
But we continue to pay attention to calories and nutrition, as well as how to apply science to cuisine, added Ms Ziegelmane.
The couple says that by writing the book, they gained a greater understanding of Mrs. Ziegelmane's mother's eating habits, such as why she was unable to throw out the food.
"She was really afraid to throw out the food," said Mr. Kou.
Mrs Ziegelmane said: "She was actually upsetting people."
Once there was an incident with wind cakes.
When we were eating in Eisenberg’s dining room, a couple of writers pulled a homemade dessert out of their bag: a plum pudding that President Roosevelt used to eat at lunchtime.
"It's plum froth," said Mrs Ziegelmane, adding that it was common at the time to give modest dishes a chic name.
It does not contain cream, only dried plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
All impatiently dipped spoons in the brown mass that was on the plates.
Surprisingly, it wasn’t that bad at all.
Mr. Kou ate some more couscous.
Hearing from an experienced "economist," he said to his wife, "I would dry a pinch of ground hazelnut."
Gilead will receive reimbursement for legal expenses in the fight with Merck for Hepatitis C patent
The District Judge has ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to reimbursement of the costs of legal services paid by it in the case of the patent infringement of Hepatitis C against the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was acquitted in a <0xC2><0xA3>200 million fine case for two Merck patents that threatened it in connection with the successful Sovaldi and Harvoni tablets, when a U.S. federal judge found violations in Merk’s activities, such as swearing-in and other misrepresentations.
In the hearing of the case on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Bets Labsons Freeman stated that Gilead has the right to claim compensation for legal expenses incurred by it in its defense of the case.
Merck is trying to gain market positions against Gilead, which dominates the market with a new generation of Hepatitis C medicines that are effective for 90% of liver diseases.
The case was launched in 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other in an attempt to obtain ownership of the newly developed active ingredient sofosbuvir, which is the main component of the Gilead medicine.
US-backed forces claim to have completely taken control of the city of Manbij from the Islamic State.
U.S.-backed forces have completely taken control of Manbij in the northern part of the state bordering Turkey and the last Islamic State troops have left the city, a group spokesman said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) are currently clearing the city of the last enemy fighters who have not yet left the city.
They have freed more than 2,000 hostages-civilians captured by fighters, Sharfan Darvish of the SDS-allied Manbij military council told Reuters.
"At the moment, the city is completely under our control and we are looking for fighters," he told Reuters.
Clinton’s income in 2015 reached $10.75 million and the couple paid a 34.2 percent federal tax rate.
Hillary Clinton on Friday published a 2015 tax return that shows that the Democratic Party presidential candidate and her husband earned $10.75 million this year and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent, respectively.
In 2015, Clinton has donated $1 million, mainly to her own Clinton charity. Former President Bill Clinton has earned about $5.3 million, speaking as a skewer and former Secretary of State has earned a "$3 million paycheck" for her work in
Clinton's electoral ally - U.S. Virginia State Senator Tim Keene and his wife Anna Holtone have published their tax returns for the past 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a federal tax rate of 20.3 percent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kein continue to set new standards for financial transparency," campaign partner Jennifer Palmer said in a statement.
Donald Trump, on the other hand, hides behind various pretenses and reservations so that he does not have to keep promises to disclose his tax information.
Disclosure of paid tax information is a record-keeping practice for U.S. presidential candidates, but is not required by law.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers mention the audit of the State Revenue Service as a reason for not disclosing tax information.
"Your move", in his Twitter post, about the Democratic Party candidate's tax information was announced by Clinton's campaign partner Ians Sams.
On Thursday, Trump’s special adviser Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release tax information before the audits are complete.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican Party presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republicans, argue that his resignation raises questions about his true size of property, donations amounts and other business commitments, including commitments to Russia.
Clinton sniffed the oil fire, releasing a video on Friday in which several influential Republicans are demanding Trump release his tax information.
She returned to this issue again during an economic speech in Michigan on Thursday.
She told the crowd: "He refuses to do what other presidential candidates have been doing for decades."
Politico reports that in the 1990s, Trump paid very little or no taxes for two years, and on Friday, a New York Times business columnist reported that many accountants and lawyers believe that nothing has changed today.
Federal tax rates are an important issue in this presidential election.
Clinton, in support of the proposal of billionaire Warren Buffett, promotes the idea that everyone who earns more than $1 million a year should pay a tax of at least 30%.
This proposal is also supported by President Barack Obama.
During Clinton's speech last week in Omaha, Nebraska, where his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is also located, Buffett invited Trump to exchange tax returns.
In addition, it is important to ensure that the information provided by the website is accurate and accurate, as well as to ensure that it is accurate and accurate.
The Clinton campaign has been publishing tax information until 2007.
Now living in Chappaqua, New York, the Clintons have paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent and a total tax rate of about 40.5 percent between 2007 and 2014.
Clinton’s 2015 tax report shows that unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income is a salary.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, from which Clinton has received $109,000 in dividends.

Jewish film director criticises hotel in Berlin for unlocking Israel’s telecoms code after an Arab request - RT News
The Jewish-born French film director set the torch on social media when he discovered that there was no Israeli telephony code available at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin. The hotel staff justified this by the demand of Arab customers.
Claude Lancman, director of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah", did not hide his dissatisfaction with the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin and addressed an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lancman tried to find the Israeli phone code in the list of hotels offered.
However, this country was not included in the list of countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible that in 2016, in Berlin, the new capital of Germany, Israel was crushed and destroyed?
Written by Lancmans.
Instead, the Kempinski Bristol hotel offers to call this country through its call center.
The director asked for an explanation from the hotel staff.
Lancman writes that the response received "shocked him".
The hotel administrator explained that "this is a deliberate decision of the hotel management".
The reason for removing the code was even more annoying for the film director.
"Most of the guests are Arabs and they asked for the deletion of the Israeli code," Lancman quotes the hotel staffer's explanation.
The Suddeutsche Zeitung reports that the Israeli ambassador to Germany, Jakov Hadas-Handelsman, has called the case a "great shame".
We are surprised and shocked by this incident.
This in itself is a great shame.
And the fact that it happened in Germany, it is in this hotel network that there is even greater humiliation.
Explanations are not required.
The official said: "We hope that the hotel will draw the right conclusions".
This event also gained quite a wide resonance on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.
Others believe that the Kempinski Hotel was simply adorned for Arab customers.
Some other record said "shut up", indicating that the hotel is located on Kurfurstendamm street next to the synagogue.
The publication Der Spiegel reports that the hotel itself quickly rejected all the objections, stating that it was all a "misunderstanding" and apologizing to Lancman.
"We have not received a direct order to remove Israel from the list of country numbers," a Kempinski representative told the Suddeutsche Zeitung.
And add that the code was again added to the list.
Police use rubber bullets and tear gas against protesting Brazilian students.
The clash between students and police took place on Thursday in the city of S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo, Brazil, where students gathered in a demonstration against the reforms of the government's education system.
Police used rubber bullets and tear gas against the students.
Problems began when law enforcement tried to exterminate students, as a result of which the police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students took part in the demonstration to demonstrate their dislike of education system reforms.
The proposal by the Governor of S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, envisages the closure of almost 100 public schools, while 300,000 students will be relocated to other schools in order to save money.
Some demonstrators drew graffiti on the walls with messages against interim President Michael Temer.
This protest took place just days after the previous protest, when students gathered at demonstrations aimed at expressing support for resigned President Dilma Rousseff, whose impeachment was voted on by the Senate.
Scott Kelums Skiners finishes first, bringing the UK a gold medal in cycling
Kelum Skinner of Scotland finished the first men's cycling team in a sprint race at the Rio cycling circuit, which took place last night. The British team defended its championship title, which it won at the 2012 London Games.
The 23-year-old athlete from Glasgow played an important role in these races, making the proud legendary Scottish Seru Kris Hoi and winning New Zealand’s favourites.
Four years ago, Britain won an astonishing victory when Hoys won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they also repeated it at the World Championships in London, although Hoy had already ended his sports career.
The problems were at the stage between Beijing and the London Olympics, as it had to replace the experienced start-up specialist Jamie Staff.
They were able to do it at the last minute.
When Hoy left, Kian Emadi and Mets Krampton tried to fill his place.
The British coaches put their hopes on Skinner, seeing in him the potential that he later also proved.
Hindes, Kenny - champions who started four years ago with Hoi and Skinner, who set the Olympic qualification record, but the best start of the race was for the New Zealand team.
However, the British trio won gold medals.
The Hinds were in a tight circle, Kenny was in charge, and Skinner was in charge.
The change of strategy played an important role in the win, as Hindes drove with a larger gear to allow Kenya and especially Skinner to drive faster.
Hoyt watched the race as a BBC representative and caught the eyes of Skinner, Kenya and Hindes as they climbed the podium.
The 23-year-old glassmaker said, "It was an unspeakable honor."
I do my best to defend my name.
In the end, we set the Olympic record and won the World Championships.
It was just unbelievable.
There is no better victory.
After winning with Kenya and Hoi at the 2012 London Olympics, Hindes admitted that she had deliberately crashed into the track after a failed start.
Later, he rejected this comment and the British competitors were not in a position to prove otherwise.
This time there was no such incident.
Hindes said: "Britain's flags in the stands recalled in memory of London."
In the last 3 months we have become a united team.
We have lost so many World Championships, so winning the Olympic Games was really special.
One medal will be awarded to a country that has won seven of the ten gold medals in cycling in Beijing and London.
If this achievement is an indicator of team progress over the last five months, then the next five days will be very exciting.
Given the outcome of Kenya, he could indeed replicate Hoya's success by winning three Olympic gold medals.
For Kenya, this would mean six gold medals and one silver medal. In addition, Kenya was also born on March 23 (it seems that this is a British holy date, because on this day Steve Regreev, Mo Farah and Roger Banister were also born).
This is also the date Hoys was born.
Kenya's next race is a sprint, which starts today and will continue for the next three days.
A 28-year-old athlete from Bolton said: "I'm just enjoying it right now.
The team’s journey is always the best.
Because then you can win together with the team members.
To be honest, winning one is a bit lonely."
Hindes said, "If he gets two more gold medals, he should be appointed to the rank of knight."
It was the only fight for medals that day, but it wasn’t the only good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Eds Clintsey, Steve Burke and Ovey Douls showed the fastest qualifying time for four-kilometers.
Their time was 3:51,943
The world record, which was set in London in 2012 is 3:51,659.
The first round and final will take place today in the second half of the day, where Vigins will definitely be in the spotlight.
Yesterday, before qualifying, he had a disagreement with the commissioner when the judges summoned him to measure his height.
In the women’s race, which will continue and conclude today, Laura Trota, Joanna Rovsela Shand, Elinor Barkere and Keith Archibald from Milngavia set a new record time of 4:13,260.
The British delegation hopes that the British cycling team, in hopes of winning medals in the middle of the Olympic Games.
Recalling the outstanding and unprecedented performance in Beijing and London, everyone expects the same achievements in Rio.
While behind the scenes, there have been various accusations of sexism and defamation, technical director Shain Saton has resigned, and Hoy and Victoria Bendleton have also ended their careers.
However, at the beginning of the first cycle races, it seems that the UK will always reach the highest level at the right time.
The future of the Portland foundry is becoming uncertain as the ambitious contract is terminated.
The future of the aluminium smelting plant and hundreds of its employees in Portland, Victoria, has become uncertain as its main customer, the energy company, has announced the termination of the cooperation.
This announcement is based on the Victorian Government's plans to stop subsidizing the energy company, which is vital for the company to continue its work.
The 20-year grants will be discontinued in November.
As a result, more than 2000 jobs at the Alcoa Portland plant are at risk.
Up to 2000 direct and indirect jobs could be at risk.
In addition, it will also have unpredictable side effects, as the meltdown consumes about 10 percent of the entire electricity supply in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry foundry, which led to the break-up of the Anglesea power station.
The Alcoa Portland foundry works with losses and may be shut down.
These events were caused by several years of speculation about the rise in the value of the Australian dollar and the cost of factory production.
AGL, the factory's energy supplier, which supplies energy from its Loy Yang A power plant in the Latroube Valley, says that the other three owners are also likely to terminate their contracts.
The majority of the power plant is owned by Alcoa and Alumia joint venture, in addition to the company’s parts are also owned by Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp holding companies.
"AGL is looking forward to continuing operations at the Portland plant, which would mean further energy supplies to the fusion plant," its representative said.
AGL stated that the contracts are so-called ‘risk-limiting contracts’, which are expected to enter into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a validity period of 12 months and will therefore be valid until 2017.
"AGL intends to receive revenue from these contracts also in fiscal year 2017," the company's representative said.
From fiscal year 2018 onwards, the potential impact on profits is limited by favourable market forecasts for wholesale electricity prices in the future.
AGL claims that it has already calculated losses in the amount of USD 187 million in its forecasts, anticipating that these contracts will be terminated.
Alcoa is informed that the decision to terminate the contracts will not affect Alcoa’s ability to continue the operation of the fusion plant or to supply it with energy.
The U.S. company announces that in 2010, it has signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, but it will be terminated in November. The company does not provide any explanation as to why it will terminate the cooperation.
Analysts have expressed concerns about both the possible closure of the Portland foundry in Victoria and the closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle, due to the weak economy of the industry.
AGL CEO Steven Mikelson said last week that according to analysts estimates, 600 megawatts of energy and 900 megawatts of energy are used by Tomago during the year in Portland.
If both of these plants were to leave the energy market, then the energy demand would be significantly reduced.
And that wouldn't be good at all.
The Community Legal Centre rejects 160 000 people every year.
Every year, more than 160 000 people's demands are rejected, and the situation could worsen if the budget is reduced.
Three out of five people in Queensland - mostly pensioners, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the means to fight illegal posting - are denied free legal aid and representation.
The Community legal centre, which is already overloaded, warns that the situation will only get worse if funding is reduced.
As of June next year, these legal centres will receive 30% less funding than they have so far.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Legal Center, said the latest report from the Association of National Legal Centers said legal aid is currently being denied to thousands of people who need it.
Master Farrell pointed out that if this decision is not reversed, then the situation will only get worse.
He also says, "Queensland Legal Center is constantly receiving insufficient funding, which means that aid is being denied to thousands of people who need it."
For people who are trying to end violent relationships, for people with deep debts, for families experiencing divorce, for workers who are unfairly dismissed - all of these people have legal problems and this report shows that they do not receive the necessary help.
As of June 2017, the federal government will cut funding by 30 percent, meaning that several thousand more Queenslanders will have to deal with their complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on Attorney General and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to immediately halt the reduction in funding so that people in need of legal aid can get it.
Last year, the government revealed its plans to raise the level of legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to also pay attention to the needs of the local communities and their customers and to the government of Palazcuk to invest in this important area.
Donald Trump's campaign indicted in court for pulling out a firearm from a staff member
New York: Organizers of Donald Trump's campaign have been charged in court for failing to act, receiving information that the head of its North Carolina operation turned a firearm on an employee when they were driving in a single car in February.
This incident was described in a court action filed by Vincent Bordini, a former campaign programmer, in Charlotte Court on Wednesday.
Bordini said that he had waited for months for an internal review of the case to be initiated, but realized that it would not happen.
Chief Earl Philip "stretched his gun, put his right index finger on the rooster and turned the rooster against Vincent's knee," Bordini claims in his complaint.
He also claims that, in submitting complaints to the local and regional campaign management, Bordini learned that at least four other people had experienced the same.
“Weapons do not have to be fired to cause damage,” Bordini said in his complaint.
Just two days before the filing of this case, the Republican Party candidate for president sparked a scandal, telling people that the "People of the Second Amendment", i.e. gun owners and enthusiasts, could act in the event of his election winning his Sanctuary.
Representatives of the Trump campaign said the media had taken his words out of context and that he had never encouraged anyone to commit violence.
With his claim, Bordini wants to recover compensation from the campaign organizers for negligent surveillance, but from Phillips - for the attack, illegal use of weapons and the creation of emotional stress.
Trump's representative, Hope Hicks, did not immediately comment.
Couldn't get in touch with Philip.
WCCB - Charlotte's local news agency says Philip has recently left the campaign.
Also failed to call his consulting firm "Innovative Consultation Services".
Presidential candidate Donald Trump of the Republican Party has run a contentious election campaign.

A new tradition - parish and sport festival in <0xC5><0x9A><0xC5><0xAB>lciems.
The first time people gathered in <0xC5><0x9A><0xC5><0xAB>lciems for the parish and sports festivals.
After ten years of celebration, this time it was decided that the feast of Lake would no longer be held.
The new page has now been redistributed.
The day began with sports competitions.
This time the competition was not in the traditional ways and too serious to be taken, because, for example, the darts had to be thrown at the sleeping target, the boot flew, with the throw of a man's left hand, "bubble" at all has not been in any Olympic Games.
However, each participant was able to show how strong, courageous, agile and rebellious he is.
After the sports games, everyone gathered in the open air theatre, where the parish festival began.
At the same time, there was also a "children's corner", where the little ones were able to protrude in the inflatable attractions and get a new image in the make-up room.
The novelty, which could also become a tradition, was a car show, in which both tractors and motorcycles went.
All were addressed by Inga Kadi<0xC4><0xB7>e-Skadi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>, head of the administration of <0xC4><0xB6><0xC5><0xAB>lciems parish, who wished for a nice rest and dry weather, although the rain flooded, but it was not able to interfere much.
The festivities continued with the greeting of the youngest inhabitants of <0xC5><0x9A><0xC5><0xAB>lciems.
It is really good that the parish has been supplemented with five girls and one boy.
With performances at the cuckolds, amateur art collectives from Engure region had arrived - the audience very much liked the senior dance group "Rudens ritmi", the performances of various folk dance performers "Redas" and young dancers "Golden Pearl".
And it's no wonder that someone also slipped on the wet stage.
Of course, the local people and the villagers were delighted by the famous actor duo J<0xC4><0x81>nis Jar<0xC4><0x81>ns and Dainis Porgants, who were once again Mildi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> Nabi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> and Skaidr<0xC4><0xAB>te Kr<0xC4><0x81>ni<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>, as well as the attractive wives of B<0xC4><0x93>rzciema from the fishing farm "Dieni<0xC5><0x86>a".
Balli was played by the band "Bruges".
The United Kingdom must maintain the Olympic spirit and expand Hittov.
Hitrov will not only promote prosperity and growth in local regions and in London, but also throughout the country.
This, in my opinion, makes Hitrov very attractive, as in 2012 in London, where we invested a lot of work to ensure that all regions of the country benefited from the Olympic Games.
Stratford and Istend have won a lot of the Olympics.
And we will do it again by providing locals and businesses with business opportunities near Hittov.
For local communities alone, we will create 10 000 new business opportunities, 40 000 new jobs and finally put an end to youth unemployment in the area of Hitrov.
Like the London Olympics in 2012, this time around there will be people who will feel that this challenge is too big and that the expansion of Heathrow is too ambitious.
At the time, people said that the UK would never be able to prepare for the Olympics and that it would be a global failure.
The skeptics were wrong about 2012 and in the case of Hitrov, they will not be right.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Hitrov has overcome everything so far.
Like the Olympic Games, Hitrov is an infrastructure project that will benefit the whole of society, not individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs, with economic growth of 211 billion, creating the ground for both employment and experience at this airport and across the UK.
In Heathrow, a great team has created a <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion infrastructure investment program, including a time-frame and budget starting with Terminal 5, which for five years has been named the best airport terminal in the world and finally with Terminal 2, which is used for the runway between two intensive
Now they are ready to set up a third runway, which will be financed by private investment of <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success, and I am sure that this will be the case with the expansion of Heathrow.
The time has come to revitalise the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, ensuring the future of our trade and creating a new employment environment that the UK could be proud of.

In Switzerland, a woman rushes to the highway in an attempt to commit suicide.
In the middle of the night, I went down to the highway.
The police are trying to find witnesses to the accident when she crossed several cars early on Thursday morning on the highway.
The accident occurred on Thursday shortly after midnight on the A1 road near the town of Morges in Vo Canton.
Vo Canton police report said that desperate to commit suicide, the woman had drowned on the road in the darkness, where she was driven by several cars.
Clearly trying to kill himself, the victim, a 49-year-old Swiss, drove several cars, including a heavy machine.
She died at the scene.
Several of the drivers involved in the accident have already given evidence, but other involved have not yet been clarified, says the police, who are calling for the involved drivers and witnesses to the accident to be recalled.
A criminal investigation has also been launched in the case, which is a logical step in this case, the lawyer Gilles Hofstellers told the publication Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it is not yet known whether any of the involved drivers will be punished.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
Hofstellers says, "It's clear prosecutors."
Two similar cases, which have occurred in the last 5 years, indicate that none of the drivers will be held liable.
In both cases, the pedestrian had left for the highway in the middle of the night, so it was decided that drivers could not predict that the pedestrian would be on the highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper reported.
Last year, a policewoman was acquitted of being killed for negligently driving in August 2014 by a man who lay in the middle of the night on the A1 road near Paijerne.
The court found that the 22-year-old victim had been drinking and later noticed falling asleep on the road.
The court concluded that the policewoman, who was on her way to the scene of the accident, was travelling in a manner appropriate to the circumstances and the judge acknowledged that the sleeping man on the road was "a completely unpredictable and extraordinary case".
Anyone with information about Thursday's accident near Morges is invited to contact the police by phone 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
On the Internet, signatures are collected for the competition of the new head of the VID.
The petition portal "Avaaz.org" started the collection of signatures for the competition of the new head of the State Revenue Service (VID).
The petition, addressed to the Ministers of the National Union (NA) and the Green and Farmers’ Union (GSU), states that the public wants a transparent and professional process for the promotion of officials.
The petition was created on 10 August and is currently signed by 55 people.
The process of nomination of Inga Ko<0xC4><0xBC>egova, the applicant for the post of Director-General of VID, is opaque and unprofessional.
This recalls the best traditions of Soviet officials.
This discredits the public administration and, once again, causes the public to be disappointed in the government and politicians.
"There is a need for a competition with clear criteria against which all candidates must be evaluated," the petition says.
Its author J<0xC4><0x81>nis B. pointed out that the public is not aware of the criteria as to how Ko<0xC4><0xBC>egov was chosen for the post.
It is also not clear what is the intention of the candidate in the work of the VID.
The petition states that the State Chancellery should create a new, open competition in which professional candidates are actively addressed, personnel selection specialists are recruited and appropriate remuneration is offered.
Finance Minister Dana Reisniece-Ozola officially nominated Ko<0xC4><0xBC>egov for the post of head of the VID last week, this week in the government it was planned to confirm him in the new post, but all the ministers of the party "Unity" voted against, so the issue was postponed for a week.
If we lose, then we play badly.
Beach volleyball players Aleksandrs Samoilovs and J<0xC4><0x81>nis <0xC5><0xA0>medi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> hoped for the prize at the Riode<0xC5><0xBE>aneiro Olympic Games, however, without coming to it, there is no difference in where to conclude the competition, after leaving the tournament Samoilovs said.
One of the strongest beach volleyball pairs in the world on Thursday in the final and decisive game of the sub-group tournament with 1–2 (16:21, 22:20, 7:15) lost to the Brazilians Evandra Gonsalves Oliveira and Pedro Solberg Salgada, concluding their participation in the sport of the quarter-finals.
In three subgroup matches Latvian athletes won one victory, but the same ratio was for two more pairs.
In the following, the relationship between the three pairs of small points was counted, which after the convincing loss suffered in this match was the most unfavourable for the duo of Latvia.
“We were in the lead in the first set, but from 16:15 we also stayed at 16 points,” <0xC5><0xA0>medi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> recalled the game progress.
I don't even know how the rest of the set got points.
You can't play that.
After that, in the second set everything was in order and at the end of the set managed to break the game, in addition, it should have a good foundation for the third set.
We started it similarly, but after we switched sides, the result grew for only one team.
We had too many mistakes in the attack.
In the subgroup, all teams were similar, almost all matches had three sets, so small points were important.
"You should have played more like this rather than giving back 3-4 points in a row," said the athlete.
We knew Evandra could be served.
In the first set we dealt with it, in the second we entered 1-2 points, but in the third at +4 he already started the game," recalled <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC4><0x93>di<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>.
We tried to show the best game.
We were there for a while, but not for a while.
I did not look at the overall situation before the match, but I knew that as many small points as possible were needed.
"If we lost, then I played badly," Samoilov said.
We waited for a good service from Evandra and with it in the first set we also managed quite well, but in the third he opened the service and it was difficult to build an attack.
In turn, I made a lot of mistakes in the reception directly at Peter’s service, but this had to be dealt with.
When you’re in a relationship, you’re in a relationship with your partner.
"We went, we played, there was protection, but we had to get a better service," said the athlete.
"They played well and at the end of the day they got into the hatch."
Before the tournament, we immediately said that the draw was the most inconvenient one could have been.
We had a chance to fight for the first place, but we didn’t even get out of the group.
“All of us expected a medal and we also expected a medal from ourselves, but then there is no longer any difference – 25th or fourth,” said Samoilovs, who predicted that the duo will continue to play together in the future.
I think that the question will not be and we will continue to play together, because this is only one tournament.
Samoilova Riodezaneiro was already in his third Olympic career, as he started in Beijing in 2008 with Martini P<0xC5><0x82>avi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>, but four years ago in London played with Ruslan Sorokin.
This was the second start for <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC4><0x93>di<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> at the Olympics.
"Latvenergo" follows the process of opening the gas market also from the position of a potential trader.
The state energy company "Latvenergo" is following the process of opening the gas market both from the position of the consumer and also a potential trader, said the company's press secretary Ivita Bidere.
"The decision on whether Latvenergo will join the gas market in the future as a trader will determine what model of the gas market and the legal framework will be created."
"Therefore, on our part, we are actively involved in the drafting and commenting of regulatory acts, as well as presenting our proposals," Bidere said.
The Agency BNS has already written that the Ministry of Economic Affairs (EM) in cooperation with the Commission for the Regulation of Public Services and the Energy Company "Latvijas G<0xC4><0x81>ze" has developed draft Cabinet Regulations "Regulations on Trade and Use of Natural Gas" which will change the existing principles of natural gas market operation from April 3, 2017.
When working on a new natural gas market framework, the aim of the EM is to make the process of natural gas trading as simple as possible and understandable to the user.
Therefore, as the most efficient and user-friendly service solution, the "trader-centric model" has been chosen, in which all activities related to customer service are provided by the trader - one contract, one invoice and one place for providing information and customer service, leaving the technical gas distribution system in terms of the distribution system operator.
A similar solution is currently being implemented in the field of electricity trading.
We remind you that a gradual opening of the market is foreseen for household users - even after 3 April 2017, those household users who do not want to choose another natural gas retailer will be able to continue to receive natural gas from the existing retailer at a regulated price, thus becoming connected users.
"In this case, the obligation to supply natural gas to connected users at a regulated price is imposed on the public trader," the ministry said.
In turn, traders will have to choose a natural gas trader with whom to conclude a natural gas trading contract.
Until the conclusion of the natural gas trading contract, the natural gas trader will provide natural gas trading to traders for a certain period of time at a fixed price.
The draft Cabinet Regulations detail the rights and obligations of the natural gas trader, system operator and users.
The rules of supply shall determine the procedure in which the supply of natural gas to the users is supplied and interrupts the supply of the supply, the requirements of the safe use of the natural gas system to the user, the trader, the public trader, the operator of the system, the user and the owner of the gasified object to the supply and use of natural gas to the customer; the procedure for the delivery of the supply of the natural gas to the customer shall be carried out.

Minister: It is planned to judge next week on the increase in the salary of the Director-General of VID.
Minister of Finance Dana Reisniece-Ozola (Green and Peasant Union) plans next week to talk with Prime Minister M<0xC4><0x81>ri Ku<0xC4><0x8D>inski (ZZS) and the partners of the government coalition about an increase in the salary of the Director-General of the State Revenue Service (SRS).
On Friday, Reisniece-Ozola pointed out to journalists that the issue of increasing the salary of the Director-General of VID must be urgently addressed in order to make this position more attractive to potential candidates for a re-entry.
You can also change the conditions of the competition at the meeting next week.
The Minister also stressed that she does not think of any specific candidate to be nominated for the vacancy.
At the same time, Reisniece-Ozola expressed the opinion that the head of the State Environmental Service, Inga Ko<0xC4><0xBC>egova, would have been a good Director General of VID.
With regard to the current head of the VID, Daci Pel<0xC4><0x97>ko, who has expressed readiness to take up this post, the Minister reiterated the view that the new VID Director-General should have a "side view" and should not come from the VID structure.
She also stressed that she is waiting for the Saeima to return from vacation in order to move as soon as possible the amendments to the laws necessary for the reorganization of the VID.
The Agency BNS has already informed that the Head of the State Environment Service Inga Ko<0xC4><0xBC>egova has submitted an application to the Minister of Finance Dana Reisniece-Ozola (ZZS), in which he withdraws his candidacy for the position of Director General of the Ministry of the Environment.
In the submission, she said that it is not an easy choice, but in the last two weeks, her relatives have experienced serious emotional pressure, although they have not taken any actions punishable by law.
In addition, Ko<0xC4><0xBC>egov pointed out that the consultation of her candidacy has increased the contradictions between the ruling coalition parties, which are also unacceptable.
It is also reported that the previous Director General of the VID, Inara P<0xC4><0x93>tersone, left office at the end of June.
Oil prices continue to rise; stock market indices in the US and Europe are rising, as well as the value of the US dollar.
World oil prices continue to rise on Friday morning, positively affecting investor sentiment in the words of Saudi Arabia’s oil minister, which reinforces expectations that the largest oil-producing countries will take action at the upcoming OPEC meeting in September.
The three major U.S. stock market indices reached a record high on Thursday, which has not been seen since 1999.
The main positive factor in the market was the rise in oil prices and the strong financial performance of several large companies.
The rise in oil prices and the strong financial performance of several companies on Thursday were also the reason for the rise in European stock indexes.
The value of the US dollar rose on Thursday against the euro, against the British pound and against the Japanese yen.
The New York Stock Exchange's WTI-branded crude oil price for deliveries in September rose by $1.78 to $43.49 per barrel on Thursday.
The Brent crude oil price for deliveries on the London Stock Exchange rose by $1.99 in October to $46.04 per barrel.
In the last year, the turnover of the canned food producer "Blue Lagoon" decreased by 33.8%.
Blue Lagoon, the canned food producer, had a turnover of 4.202 million euros last year, which is 33.8% less than a year earlier, while the company's losses fell 5.7 times - to 904.7 thousand euros, according to the annual financial report published in the database "Lursoft".
The management report of the company states that in 2015 the company worked with losses incurred for a number of reasons, including in connection with the permanent shortage of circulating funds, caused by the departure of Unicredit Bank from the Baltic market, the termination of the existing credit line, and the possible completion of it with Zilo lag.
As a result, the company did not have sufficient resources to buy cheaper raw materials in large quantities and receive a discount on the volume.
The departure of the bank from the Latvian market also prevented the company from implementing European Union Structural Funds support projects that would have allowed the plant to purchase new production equipment and modernize the infrastructure.
Similarly, the financial creators of the company in the previous year were negatively affected by the rise in the price of raw materials and the unwillingness of customers to pay more for the goods produced by the company.
"Only in the second half of July 2016 customers recognized the price changes and were ready to buy goods at the new - the highest - prices," says the management of the company.
Also in 2015 "Blue Lagoon" began negotiations with potential investors, including valuation of the company's movable and immovable property.
Investors have already been to the company's largest creditor "Unicredit Leasing", where the parties have become familiar with and discussed possible investment plans.
At the same time, the company’s operations and development were positively influenced by the implementation of the restructuring and optimization plan in life, which started in 2014 and 2015.
This plan included the improvement and optimization of technological processes to achieve higher production productivity and capacity.
"A number of equipment were purchased to provide a higher production speed," the company's management said.
The management of "Blue Lagoon" notes that the purchased equipment in 2016 will allow the company's production plant to fulfill orders that were not possible until now.
The first batch of production, which will be produced on this equipment, will be ready in August.
Since the intentional protocols for the sale of the product have already been signed, all the produced will be sold in accordance with the intentional protocols.
The new product will increase the turnover by around 300 thousand euros per month”, says the management of the company.
Also, the company plans to sign a cooperation agreement on the supply of fish production to Iraq in August 2016.
In 2016, Blue Lagoon has shipped the first experimental container to Israel, expanded the sales market to Cyprus and will sign a cooperation agreement with a new supermarket chain in the US in September this year.
As a result of all the above measures, the company plans to increase turnover.
In 2014, "Blue Lagoon" worked with <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6.347 million in turnover and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5.113 million in losses.
"Blue Lagoon" was founded in 1997 and its core capital is 1.156 million euros.
The company is owned by two Latvian individuals - Mikhail Kaidanov (89.11%) and Igor <0xC5><0xA0>ir<0xC5><0xA1>on (10.89%).
Welcome at 15 at the museum to meet the cinematographer Z<0xC4><0x81>ra Leanderi and participate in the press conference.
Riga can be considered the city of the beginning and inspiration of Sarah Leander’s wonderful career.
Zara Lender’s stay at the cross-mother Ruta, who was the Swedish ambassador to Latvia, turned out to be fateful in Riga in 1924, because it was she who discovered Zara Leander’s woman’s unusual low contralto, which she tried to make her debut on the theatre stage in Riga’s cabaret.
Perhaps it was the accidental feeling in Riga that became the fateful turning point in Zara’s creative journey towards world glory.
R<0xC4><0xAB>ga Z<0xC4><0x81>ra Leandera was bound by warm memories, and she hoped to come to Riga for guest performances, but unfortunately this hope was not destined to be fulfilled, because the Second World War began.
Using the form of the performance, this meeting will be possible at the Riga Festival 2016 and the excellent Ieva Ker<0xC4><0x93>vica will play the role of Zara Leandere.

The insurer shall pay compensation to passengers on a cancelled flight at the airport on Wednesday.
If Insurance has paid travel insurance to a family for a flight cancelled at Riga airport on Wednesday, August 10, which caused them to refuse to attend the intended music festival.
On August 11, If Insurance received an application for compensation from a client.
The family had planned to go to a music festival in Belgium, but, as this was not possible due to cancellations at the airport on Wednesday, the customer was charged for the reservation of accommodation, which could not be canceled any more, as well as for the tickets purchased at the festival.
In turn, the airline has promised to reimburse customers for the money spent on airline tickets.
If Insurance of all travel insurance benefits on average 15% of the cases have paid compensation for the interruption or cancellation of the trip.
"At such times, expenses for the purchase, return or exchange of tickets, as well as for the reservation of accommodation, are reimbursed," says Dagnia Rutka, the manager of the insurance product of If Insurance Persons.
As you know, on the evening of August 10, a private plane stopped at Riga airport due to technical problems on the runway, so only several departures were cancelled, but several incoming flights had to be diverted to other airports.
Due to the repair of the neighbor, the man comes to the collapsed ceiling and is forced to leave the house.
In the LTV broadcast "4.study" addressed Dmitry Saidyashevs, whose neighbor started the capital repair in his apartment, and since then Dmitry from the ceiling rubs plaster and is not sure that staying in the apartment is safe.
The problem is that my neighbors carried out arbitrary construction and my apartment has a damaged ceiling.
Then I informed the Riga Construction Authority, the house manager and other organizations.
The building board said that we are not any operational service and we do not have any expert.
"The owner of the apartment has to go to the Latvian Engineers' Union, and there will be an expert from there," says Dmitry.
The invited expert appeared, recorded what had happened and acknowledged that the cover was in an unsatisfactory position.
However, a month has passed since the first application of Dmitry to the building board, and until the beginning of this week, no one was able to answer whether being in the apartment is not life-threatening.
In the building board said - this is the legislation, wait, if you are not satisfied, write to everyone in a row.
"Then I wrote to the Riga Council, but they transferred the house to the manager, then the house manager back to the building management, and then there is a dead end," says Dmitry.
After looking at all the pile of paper, it is clear that the construction works are suspended, something that can be heard at any moment that someone is working there.
Within two more months it would be necessary to carry out an expert examination and within six months the owner of the apartment, who is carrying out repairs, would have to correct all these defects.
The independent expert has drawn up his opinion, but the construction administration considers it incomplete and superficial.
The expert has not indicated whether the metal lattice in this supporting structure has been affected, so there is no certainty that the owner of the lower apartment is at risk.
“Therefore, we have asked for additional explanation from this expert,” says Ilze <0xC5><0xBD><0xC5><0xAB>ka, a representative of the Riga City Council.
Despite the prohibition to carry out any repairs in the upper apartment, from there always hear that the construction continues.
The penalty for arbitrary construction without a building permit is from 70 to 700 euros, but in this particular case the penalty can be much harsher.
While the expert opinion is awaited, the construction board has decided that both apartments should not be operated - both in which construction works are being carried out and in Dmitry's apartment.
"This has not been the case in the practice of construction management, when in this way, due to their ignorance or simply unwillingness, the citizens may have created a threat not only to their property, but also to the owner of the lower property, as a result of which this owner cannot exploit his property", says the building.
Now Dmitriy is left to look for another place to live - by friends, friends, hotel or rent another apartment.
But the losses caused by Dmitry can try to recover from his neighbor in a civil court, which can take a lot of time.
Due to arbitrary construction, it is currently prohibited to stay in both apartments until the construction engineer gives his conclusion, and it may take up to three weeks to wait.
The resulting losses will have to be covered by the owner of the apartment in which repairs have taken place.
The owner of this apartment is also threatened with imprisonment for a period of up to six months due to the fact that the building management did not take into account what was said.
Take it!
How many lions in this picture?
The correct answer is five.
In Ukraine, five white lions were born in the Demidov zoo near Kiev.
Everyone feels good and sometimes cries out to the common, despite the fact that the common babies feed.
The conversion of the former <0xC4><0xB6>emeri sanatorium into a five-star hotel will cost 22 million euros.
The transformation of the former <0xC4><0xB6>emeri sanatorium into a five-star hotel "Park Hotel <0xC4><0xB6>emeri" will cost 22 million euros, the representative of the future hotel manager SIA "Park Hotel <0xC4><0xB6>emeri" Gita <0xC5><0xBD>elve tells LETA.
The establishment of the hotel is the first stage of renovation of the former sanatorium of Kemeru.
The second phase will be the wellness clinic, which is planned to be opened in 2022, while the hotel is scheduled to open in May 2018.
The turtle notes that the exact cost of the clinic is not yet known.
However, she indicates that it will be located in the former polyclinic building of the <0xC4><0xB6>emeru resort, which has an area of about 12,000 square meters.
The clinic will be located on three floors.
"Park Hotel <0xC4><0xB6>emeri" and the owner of the planned clinic is the international fund "G Capital Europe", which invests in European assets.
The owners of G Capital Europe are a number of investors who invest in this fund, according to Turtle.
As George Jones, CEO of G Capital Europe, said earlier, it is planned to invest <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>12 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 million in the establishment of the former resort polyclinic, with a total investment of over <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million.
It has already been announced that in the restoration of the cultural and historical park more than 42 hectares of <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> republika will be joined by millions of <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1>
Design works are planned until mid-2017, but construction and ordering work will begin in the autumn of next year.
As reported, in the historic sanatorium complex "<0xC4><0xB6>emeri" it is planned to build a five-star hotel "Park Hotel <0xC4><0xB6>emeri" and "wellness" or wellness clinic.
However, the reconstruction takes a long time.
On the other hand, in the 2010 review, it was also stated that "Ominasis" regularly communicates with the hotel operator "Kempinski", who continues to provide daily technical control in the sanatorium "<0xC4><0xB6>emeri" and already in 2011 will meet the "completed reconstruction of the upcoming hotel "<0xC4><0xB6>emeri".
In October 2014, Park Hotel <0xC4><0xB6>emeri confirmed its readiness to buy the property of the insolvent <0xC4><0xB6>emeri sanatorium owned by "Ominasis Latvia" at the auction, but a month later the auction was declared as not happening, because the winner had not paid for the purchase at the specified time.
The sale price was determined according to the starting price of the last non-occurring auction - EUR 2.86 million.
As the Agency LETA informed the representative of the City Council Ieva Aile, the municipality, when signing the protocol, confirmed that with the support of the European Union Structural Funds co-financing will arrange the adjacent infrastructure - the restoration of the historical <0xC4><0xB6>emeri park, the creation of an interactive natural roadside site.
The President will present the Order of the Three Stars to the surgeon Antonenko.
The President of the Republic, Raimonds V<0xC4><0x93>jonis, will present next week, on 16 August, Alexander Antonenko, the Operator of the Order of the Three Stars III, according to the President’s agenda.
The award ceremony of the Order of the Three Stars will take place at the House of the Negroes at 13:00.
According to the information provided by the Latvian National Opera and Ballet (LNOB), Antonenko graduated in 1998 from the J<0xC4><0x81>zeps Med<0xC4><0xAB><0xC5><0x86>as Music College, where he studied blowing instruments and learned singing with Margarita Gruzdeva.
He studied at the Vocal Department of J<0xC4><0x81>zeps V<0xC4><0xAB>tols Latvian Academy of Music in Arv<0xC4><0xAB>das Lustes class.
In turn, in 1997 he began singing in the Latvian National Opera Choir, but in 1998 he made his debut with the role of Oberto in G.F.Hendelis opera "Al<0xC4><0x8D>ina".
Received the "Grand Music Award 2003" for vocal performances in opera performances and in Verdi Requiem.
It is noted that in the 2004/2005 season he became the most internationally recognized tenor of Latvia, who is engaged by the largest opera houses in the world.
Since autumn 2004 he has been performing at the Deutsche Oper am Rhein in Düsseldorf, the Berlin and Graz Opera, the Semperoper in Dresden, the Royal Opera in Oslo and Stockholm, the Covent Garden Opera in London, the Monte Carlo Opera in Vienna, the Vienna State Opera in Vienna and the Oper in Vienna.
In 2009, Antonenko made his debut with great success in the Metropolitan Opera in the role of Prince in "Nara".
In turn, in 2011 Antonenko sang with Ricardo Muti and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra the title track "Otello" in the Paris Opera, in the Covent Garden Opera he sang Luigi "Apmet<0xC5><0x86>a" in the new studio, as well as participated in the "Christophe Loja" in Stockholm.
A year later, Antonenko sang Otello's role in the London Covent Garden Opera with great success.
The former NATO commander Bridlov’s e-mail was hacked by Russian hackers.
Hackers who hacked the computers of the U.S. Democratic National Committee (DNC) may have carried out a number of other cyberattacks, also hacked the e-mails of former NATO European Force Commander Philip Bridlow and the servers of the George Soros Institute of Open Society Business, a quartet.
Hackers have published the information on DCLeaks.com.
Among other things, Bridlow’s list and news about the work of the Soros Institute have been placed there.
Computers of the Institute have been available to hackers for a whole year.
According to Bloomberg, these cyberattacks were carried out by the same hackers linked to Russian intelligence services who hacked DNC emails.
The Wall Street Journal, in turn, reports that the administration of US President Barack Obama is currently examining the issue of imposing new sanctions on Russia, thus responding to the hacking of DNC computers.
In order to impose sanctions, the administration will have to formally cyberattack the servers of the Democratic Party to accuse the hackers supported by Russia or the Russian authorities.
As reported, the website WikiLeaks published in July about 20,000 e-mails from the DNC computer system, which suggest that the leaders of the Democratic Party tried to harm the party's candidate Hillary Clinton's former vice president of the Senate.
According to U.S. press sources, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which conducts an investigation into the hacking of Democratic servers, and other U.S. intelligence agencies, consider Russia’s connection to the cyberattack to be almost unquestionable.
MacArthur: Joko Ono's presence threatened The Beatles.
Paul McCartney has admitted that Joko Ono's presence has created a sense of danger for the legendary Beatles.
The 74-year-old rock star currently maintains a "good" relationship with the widow of the villain John Lennon, but at the time when she left the group to visit the recording studio, McCartney was scared because Ono was the only woman in the group among the members - George Harrison, Ringo Stair.
When the singer was asked about the two relationships, he told Rolling Stone magazine, "They're really good."
We felt threatened at the time.
While we were recording, she sat on the amplifiers.
The majority of the group could not bear it.
We were able to do this, but not quite successfully, because we were very tense.
We were not sexists, but the girls usually did not come to the recording studio, they allowed us to work.
When John started dating Joko, she was not sitting in the control room, but in the middle of the four of us.
The author of the Yellow Submarine also admitted that he now regularly contacts Ringo, a former member of the group, and from time to time approves the recording studio's plans for Apple's work, but otherwise "The Beatles" have "discontinued".
When asked if he was still dating the only other living member of the legendary rock band, McCartney told Rolling Stone magazine: "Often not."
We meet at social events and parties.
However, I don’t go to meetings, I feel a little disconnected from it.
I left Apple during a difficult divorce.
In my place, I sent John Trueman to the meetings and said, "Tell me what everyone is saying, because I can't suffer sitting at that table."
It was too painful, as if to see your pet dead.
The company now works so that I just listen to all the recordings.
I am part of the approval process.
NASA climate model: Venus was once a habitable planet
Based on NASA’s latest climate models, Venus has once been a habitable planet.
Scientists at NASA’s Godard Space Research Institute have developed a model to explore the history of Venus using tools and algorithms also used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether on Venus, whose surface is hot, where there is no water and whose atmosphere consists almost exclusively of carbon, there have ever been Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation speed of Venus can be explained by the dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulations show that Venus once had a flat, Earth-like atmosphere, and it turned slowly.
The model also looks at the earlier topography of Venus.
There was more arid area on the planet than there was on Earth, but there was enough water and geographical diversity on it to create life and prevent water from evaporating.
In the early days of Venus, the sun was 30 percent brighter.
In the simulation of the GISS model, the rotation model of Venus reveals that the light part of the day lasts for 2 months, explained GISS scientist Antonius Del Genio in a press release.
This process warms the planet's surface and causes a thing to form thick layers of clouds that act as a raincoat, protecting the planet from the heat of the sun.
The result is a moderate climate temperature, which is actually a few degrees lower than the temperature on Earth today.
The model depicts the history of Venus, which is similar to the theory of evolution developed by scientists in their hypotheses.
Although once habitable, over the course of several billion years Venus has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet rays.
Its oceans were evaporated, and the rays of ultraviolet rays were extinguished.
When the water was completely evaporated, only the atmosphere of thin carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse gas - Venus, as we know it today - remained in the pair.
Scientists have published the results of the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
On Thursday, Colorado's Avalanche coach and vice president of hockey operations Patrick Roy submitted a resignation as a reason to mention the insufficient impact on the team's decision-making process.
Colorado vice president and general manager Joe Sakiks confirmed the news and informed that the club will immediately start looking for a new coach.
"For the past three years, I have been energetically, enthusiastically and purposefully fulfilling my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Club," Roy, 50, said in a statement.
During this summer, I have been thinking a lot about how I could improve the performance of the team to give it the necessary brightness and achieve higher level results.
To achieve this, the visions of the head coach and the vice-president of hockey operations must be fully consistent with the visions of the organization.
He must also be able to influence decisions relating to the performance of the team.
At present, these conditions are not met.
Sakik, who deposed Paradise on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
He said Patrick informed him of his decision today.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organisation and wish him all the best in the future.
In his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014, Roy was recognized as the best coach of the league and received the Jack Adams Award.
He helped the club to reach 112 points and first place in the Central Division, but the Colorado team won the first round of the exclusion games. Since then, the club has not entered the exclusion games for two years.
Avalanche finished the 2015-2016 season with a score of 39-39-4 and stayed five points behind Wild's team, without winning the second special invitation from the organizers of the Western Conference.
In his career, Hall of Fame goalkeeper Roy has won four Stanley Cups - two with Montreal's "Canadiens" and two with "Avalanche".
North Sea Oil Platform Workers Resume Negotiations and Delay Strike
The strikes of employees on the remuneration of workers of the North Sea oil platforms have been postponed, as the negotiations have resumed between the two parties involved in the dispute, the negotiators said.
Periodically strikes against the oil processing company Wood Group are carried out on the North Sea oil platforms operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
The joint statement states that Wood Group and Unite and RMT have agreed to resume negotiations on the settlement of the dispute.
Several full-day meetings are scheduled to begin at the beginning of next week in the coming weeks with the aim of re-examining the problematic issues.
The trade unions announced that their recent measures, organised after a break of more than 25 years, are aimed at reducing their planned wages by 30 percent.
Due to negative market pressure, Wood Group has reduced the salaries of workers in the North Sea by 9 percent this year.
In 2014, the company already reduced the wages of land workers by 10 percent.
The company explains that additional salary reductions would allow the company to survive the market downturn.
Shell, on the other hand, has already reduced the salaries of several thousand people and announced plans to stop oil and natural gas operations in 10 countries in order to optimize its work in preparation for a large-scale merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from falling oil prices, and the situation is much more complicated by Britain's decision to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of the week, MEP Davies Anderson met with workers' representatives to discuss one of the most important issues - the North Sea strike plans.
He said that the North Sea is vital for the region's economy.
In his report, he explains that the North Sea and the country as a whole need an economy that benefits everyone, not individuals.
In 2016, almost $1.4 billion is expected to be invested in new North Sea projects, compared with $7 billion invested in the last five years.
Kepler-sized stellar rotation speed in the Pleiades constellation.
The latest Kepler telescope mission has helped astronomers compile the most complete catalogue of stellar rotation speeds in Pleiades.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars in this constellation rotate at different speeds, as well as how the speed of rotation of stars can be attributed to the formation of planets.
"We hope that when we compare our results with other stars, we will get more information about the relationship between the mass of the stars, the age of the stars and even the history of their solar system," the Pasadena Caltech Infrared Process and Analytical Center scientist Luanissa said in the news release.
The Pleiades star is located 445 light-years away from Earth.
Many stars in this constellation are just beginning to grow, reaching the age of about 125 million years.
They rotate at the maximum speed.
When cutting at maximum speed, these rising stars emit a large amount of stellar wind.
When the winds enter the magnetic field of the stars, they brake the stars.
As stars age, their rotational speed decreases.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by determining the time between the appearance of a recognisable area of stars, such as a sunspot.
The latest catalogue of stellar rotational speeds shows that larger stars rotate slower than smaller stars.
Rebuls compares stars to dancers, larger-sized dancers perform pirouettes slower than small-sized dancers.
Rebuls says that the Pleiades "ballet" shows that slow-rotating objects are larger and more massive, while faster-rotating objects are very small stars.
Thanks to its proximity to the Pleiades constellation, it serves as an excellent space laboratory where stellar characteristics can be compared with rotational speeds.
Rebuls says that the Pleiades constellation helps to form theoretical models for the rotation of stars in both directions for both older and younger stars.
We still have a lot to learn about how, when and why the speed of rotation of stars will slow down and the process of stopping them completely.
Rebuls and his colleagues presented in detail the analysis of the rotational speed of Pleiades stars in three new publications, which will soon be published in the Journal of Astronomy.
