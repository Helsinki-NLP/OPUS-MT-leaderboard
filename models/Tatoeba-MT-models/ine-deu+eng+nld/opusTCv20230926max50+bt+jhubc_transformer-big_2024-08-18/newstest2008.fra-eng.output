Inflation, in Europe, has slipped on the diet
Accelerated inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid rise in food prices.
In November, the increase in prices in the 13 countries of the euro area was greater than forecast, after an inflation rate of 2.6 per cent in October, annual inflation of 3.1 per cent was recorded, according to the statistics office of the European Community located in Luxembourg.
The official forecasts indicated only 3 percent, Bloomberg said.
Unlike the US, UK and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the key interest rate by saying that lowering interest rates, with rising commodity prices and falling unemployment rates, would lead to the generation of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate below but close to two percent.
According to one analyst, it is Catch 22 for the ECB: "we must deter" inflation in order to no longer have to intervene on this issue later.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3.3 per cent is a record over the last 12 years and in Spain it has risen from 3.6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area has picked up due to the rapid rise in food and energy prices.
The futures market for cereals has increased by 88 percent and the soybean price has also reached its highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and dairy products also increased significantly in 2007.
This year, the world oil price rose by 52 percent and last month, a barrel of black gold cost nearly $100.
According to the ECB, in 2008, the inflation rate will rise from 2.1 per cent this year to 2.5 per cent, but in 2009 it will fall to 1.9 per cent.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate remains around 3 percent, however, in the next 3 to 4 months, the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to lower the key rate twice in 2008.
Gallup warns of government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of supporters of Fidesz (Alliance of Young Democrats) increased significantly at the beginning of December. Thus, since 2002, it currently has the largest number of supporters, while Gallup (Institute of Polling) has never before seen such low socialist support, namely 13 percent.
For loyal voters, the difference would be more than two-thirds (71 per cent) support against a fifth (20 per cent) support for the MSZP (Hungarian Socialist Party) due to the greater determination of opposition voters.
According to the survey, the MDF (Hungarian Democratic Forum) and the SZDSZ (Alliance of Free Democrats) are below the threshold of parliamentarians: their support is two percent in the entire population.
Of the loyal voters certain to go to vote, the number of supporters of both parties increased by 1 percent.
The economic climate has continued to deteriorate compared to the previous lowest point, the proportion of those who felt that the economic situation in the country was particularly serious has never been so high, it rises to 41 per cent and according to 46 per cent complementary the situation is quite serious.
After the more optimistic prospects of last spring and summer, families are again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For the next year, the majority of the population expects an aggravation and only one-tenth expects an improvement in the situation.
In December, 71 percent of those polled, a majority never seen in previous Gallup polls, said the prime minister was doing his job rather badly than well.
13 percent of respondents have confidence or a lot of confidence in Ferenc Gyurcs<0xC3><0xA1>ny while 38 percent support Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n.
54 percent don’t trust the prime minister at all and 27 percent don’t trust the president of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of change in the political situation is the proportion of society thinking that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be dealt with without a change of government.
While after the October riots, 35 per cent of respondents wanted the government and the prime minister to remain in office, currently that rate is only 20 per cent. The relative majority (33 per cent) believes that the holding of new elections would be the solution to this situation.
When asked about the intention to vote, 60 percent of respondents said they would certainly vote and the additional 20 percent said they would probably vote.
To make the comparison, for a "legislative election to be held next Sunday", only 55 percent of respondents would certainly participate and 15 percent would probably participate. According to current intentions, the result of the referendum would be no doubt.
74 percent of people would say no to enrolment in higher education, 79 percent would say no to consultation fees and 84 percent would say no to hospital stay fees.
When we look at only the same proportions of people who expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters, respectively, would reject the introduction of registration fees, consultation fees and hospital stay fees.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its prices by almost twenty percent
Hypermarkets located in the Budaörs commercial triangle maintained the average price increase of 16 percent last year, as opposed to the fact that this year the VAT rate has not increased.
Article by Napi Gazdas<0xC3><0xA1>g (Daily Economy)
This year, in the commercial triangle of Budaörs, the usual daily Christmas Basket also increased by 16 percent on average, a value increase of well over a thousand forints was displayed in all hypermarkets.
Prices, “which had already gone up” in grocery stores last December, have not risen sharply since the previous high base.
Nevertheless, consumers are obviously shocked to see that items purchased well below nine thousand forints last year now cost more than ten thousand forints.
The daily Basket in the surveyed hypermarkets exceeded the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints by 91 forints at a minimum.
And the highest value of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, this value was 6,800 forints.)
Prices for Unicum and live fish remained almost at last year's level, but prices for turkey net, nut and poppy have risen sharply.
In the shops, the price of flour and bread followed the data of the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics) but, at Auchan, bread from one kilo to 139 forints was found only.
The competition did not lower the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was surprising to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the recorded bottle of two liters of Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, so it cost only 257 forints the recorded bottle included.
Only this year, in terms of Daily Basket, Auchan was the most expensive and Cora the cheapest.
According to our calculations, Cora increased the price of its Daily Basket by 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan increased it by about 18 and 18 percent, respectively.
Comparing last year’s most expensive basket and this year’s cheapest basket, we see a 12 percent gap while the difference between last year’s cheapest and this year’s most expensive basket is 21 percent.
Prices increased by 1,480 forints on average.
Last year, prices increased by an average of 1,206 forints, while knowing that the impact of the increase in the VAT rate had already been noticed in last year's Christmas prices.
As this process perplexed trade, hypermarkets were visibly unable to determine what margin they would apply to products as they were unable to predict the impact of changing prices on consumption.
(If a trader miscalculates the turnover of a product, he or she is likely to lose a large profit on the margin adapted to the intensity of the trade.)
Due to the change in the VAT rate, the increase in daily basket prices was so excessive that the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints higher than the 2006 value, while the difference between the cheapest baskets was only 844 forints.
This year, the difference was not that excessive since the value of the most expensive basket was higher by 1,630 forints than last year and the prices of the cheapest also increased by 1,284 forints.
As we approached the two Christmas seasons, we saw a catastrophic increase in prices, in less than 20 months the prices of everyday consumer items increased by more than 30 percent in hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm KSH's data: for some essential feeds, the Institute of Statistics observed a price increase of more than 30 per cent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, with flour and egg.)
According to the Daily Basket of the latter, this seems almost absurd since the price level of this product, already very expensive last year, has increased by barely more than 10 percent compared to the base.
According to the indices, flour suppliers occupy a stronger position than egg suppliers because they have managed to get the brutal increase in prices also accepted by multinationals.
In the commercial gold triangle, hypermarkets do not complain, they constantly record good years.
According to our experience, the majority of customers no longer look at prices in the three hypermarkets visited.
They buy everything in quantity, they take the long-conserving food by pallets.
On Wednesday morning, important queues formed at the checkout desks of the three hypermarkets as the number of customers increased sharply.
However, according to our information, turnover is less important in the province, many multinationals complain to survey companies that they do not even reach the expected turnover, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer goods.
Many hospitals are saving on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, mainly caused by the misuse of antibiotics, have been recorded in hospitals.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, the overwork of medical staff do not help to block infections, says the chief physician of the National Centre for Epidemiology.
Many hospitals are also saving on disinfectants
Not long ago an MRSA infection was diagnosed at the traumatology department of J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Hospital.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was detected on a man hospitalized following a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year, a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The injured person in a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital but soon after he had to return to the hospital due to an MRSA infection and, since then, doctors have not been able to do a major operation because of the bacteria that is in his body.
As of December 10 this year, 1,094 hospital infections generated by a multi-resistant pathogen have been reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröcz, chief physician at the National Centre for Epidemiology.
We know that it is the number of infections caused by a multi-resistant pathogen that has actually been recorded in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
About two-thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, i.e. staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin-oxacillin.
A third of people carry the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus (SA) in their noses without developing a disease.
Infections caused by SA (such as angina, tonsillitis, skin infections, traumatic infections) respond well to antibiotics, they are easily curable.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, the bacterium, which responds well to antibiotics, will develop a bacterium that is well resistant to antibiotics that will quickly proliferate in poor hospital conditions.
In case of temporary or prolonged malfunction of the immune system, this bacterium can cause serious hospital infections, such as traumatic infection or sepsis, on elderly patients, low weight or with a weakened organism.
According to J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Hospital's chief physician, there is nothing special about MRSA infections, these infections are part of the daily lives of hospitals.
Above all, the infection should not be confused with the epidemic, we do not find MRSA only or we do not look for them, said Tibor Nyulasi.
SAs are resistant to antibiotics.
“These patients are isolated, the caregivers wear rubber gloves and protective masks and we have antibiotics adapted to treat them,” said Tibor Nyulasi.
A priori, hospitalized patients are examined if they are carriers of MRSA, however infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling of the sample is not fashionable
The vast majority of infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but the current conditions and circumstances are not favorable, in Hungarian hospitals, to prevent the development and proliferation of multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection manifests mainly in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should monitor hospitalized patients and immediately isolate MRSA-carrying patients.
However, microbiological sampling is not in vogue in Hungarian hospitals.
It should be noted that the National Social Security Fund does not finance these examinations.
Most cases come to light only if the MRSA infection is detectable on the patient, said the chief physician of the epidemiological center.
The European Union has strict recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are Hungarian guidelines also for the cure of certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts need to be made to target antibiotic therapy, in other words, microbiological examinations should be performed to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take this into account.
Microbiological sampling is even rarer in outpatient and basic care, Karolina Böröcz said.
Many hospitals are saving on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSAs proliferate from one patient to another most often through medical personnel.
It is therefore essential to wash your hands, put on gloves and protective masks. However, significant gaps are detected in hospitals also in this area.
MRSAs are spread by infection transmitted by inhalation of droplets and by contact. However, due to conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the infected patient cannot always be isolated.
In addition, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too close to each other, while in terms of an epidemic, patients should be at least 1.5 meters away from each other.
Unfortunately, we also find that hospitals, in a difficult financial situation, make savings on disinfectants, they lack nurses, there are many patients, so the risk of contamination is even greater, said Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals or preventive measures are observed, the number of infections is demonstrably lower or the proliferation of the pathogen can be blocked.
Government project against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection represents exorbitant expenditures for social security funds, which is why this infection is fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has established a program to prevent or reduce the incidence of MRSA.
According to published data, this program is effective and MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) highlights among its priorities the prevention of the incidence of multidrug-resistant pathogens (such as MRSA) as well as the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The commissioner, who was involved in a fatal accident, was not drunk.
The official statement regarding the fatal accident caused by the Commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement has been made.
It can be ruled out that the commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement, resigned from his post since, who crushed a pedestrian causing his death last Tuesday, led in a state of drunkenness or dizziness, said Friday Attila Morvai, a spokesman for the public prosecutor's office of the capital after the relative finding was established.
The finding confirmed the first result of the investigation which already found that the former commissioner had not consumed alcohol before getting behind the wheel
Last Tuesday, the former head of the 22nd arrondissement police station crushed a 55-year-old man who stood in front of him when he turned, with his personal car, in Kossuth Lajos street in the 22nd arrondissement. The man wanted to cross the road by not passing through the pedestrian crossing.
(By the way, the fact that he crossed the road outside the pedestrian crossing is not a mitigating circumstance, according to the Road Code a car that starts a turn must let pedestrians pass.)
The pedestrian died after being taken to the hospital.
Following the accident, the Commissioner resigned from his post and applied for retirement because, according to the police report, this accident has greatly upset him.
The investigation into the case is carried out by the Prosecutor's Office in Budapest.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former commissioner cooperated from the beginning with the magistrates charged with conducting the investigation.
Additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million for infrastructure
J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres, Hungarian Finance Minister, and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million credit line agreements in Budapest on Friday to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million for the Hungarian budget financing of transport and environmental projects to be carried out from the Cohesion Fund, with a credit agreement worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million already signed by the parties.
The <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million loan agreement also covers the budgetary financing of education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million for Hungary, with the remaining <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million to be used at a later date following the extension of the loan agreement.
The parties have signed a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 million contract for innovation, the state budget will use this envelope primarily as part of the research and development project to be carried out at the University of Debrecen.
During the negotiations, the project of metro line 4 was also discussed.
The parties agreed that they would re-discuss the possible modification of the initial contract when Hungary has finalised the details of the subway financing with the EU.
According to J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres, this could be done in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has provided a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8.4 billion to finance 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB grants its appropriations at the EURIBOR rate, with an 8-year grace period and no commitment fee.
Bulgaria, a paradise for the EU real estate market
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, the attention of all Europe is turned to this country of the Balkans little mentioned in the past.
What, or and who bought in this EU market which is always the cheapest but which will quickly become expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Currently, in real estate, Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most popular target in Eastern Europe with its ski apartments and cheap seaside houses.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, by the sea, Albena, the "Golden Sands", the "Sun Coast", the old Sozopol and Nessebar but they are increasingly looking for a building in the Kavarna and Balcik region as well.
According to the analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later, the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also arouse the interest of investors and they are also more and more to buy in the very cheap corner of Ruse.
Sofia, the capital, offers attractive opportunities as well, the shopping and office areas promise the highest depreciation rate.
Bulgaria is on track to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe and thus be a priority destination, after the summer season and the winter season, also in the other two seasons of the year.
More vigilant investors are already buying in large numbers, for example in the corner of Bansko.
According to analysts, people buying a building in Bulgaria are at the same time looking to change their lives, their way of life.
Most of the buyers are English but others come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
The Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present. On the Black Sea coast and in the most famous ski resorts, we traditionally meet many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgiy Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who plan to settle buy renovated buildings, at a price ranging between 50 and 100 thousand euros, or old decommissioned houses, at a price ranging from 5 to 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication possibilities, the proximity of a large city, shops and in general that of the local doctor.
The second group includes buyers of secondary residences (since last December, Bulgaria is listed among the top 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group consists of commercial investors who buy in the hope of achieving a medium or long-term added value.
The price of the capital's buildings is constantly rising due to an increasing demand.
In the European Union, property prices are the lowest in Bulgaria. However, in the last 5 years, they have increased by 21 percent each year.
The increase in real estate prices mainly exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and the Hungarian Six Percent
According to G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, the meetings of the professionals will end on Tuesday, however, on Wednesday, after the official opening, the negotiations of the ministers on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali Roadmap to define the efforts to be made after the period of emission reductions defined by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
At the moment, there are intense discussions between developing countries and developed countries on this issue.
The United States also reported that, for the time being, it did not wish to discuss exact figures, although it was ready to sign an agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 25 to 40 per cent from 1990 levels until 2020.
Another important topic of the conference is to see whether developed countries commit themselves, without reducing emissions, to providing financial and technological assistance to countries in need.
An agreement has also been signed on aid to developing countries.
The aid fund defined by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a Board of Directors composed of probably 16 members within the framework of the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), Piac és Profit (Market and Profit) said.
Six Percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, confirms the EU's ambition to maintain its role as a flagship in global efforts to protect the climate and encourage the signing of the new international agreement before 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU was committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 from the level reached in 1990, regardless of the success of the signing of the “After 2012 Agreement”, and it was ready to reduce them by up to 30 per cent if the other major regions of the world and/or developing countries were also ready to take on their responsibilities.
G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor recalled that in 1997, the signatory countries of the Kyoto Protocol had aimed at a total reduction of 5.2 per cent and all 15 EU members of that time made the commitment of 8 per cent less.
Hungary has made a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent compared to the period between 1985 and 1987, our country will meet its commitment, recalls the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The challenge is great in Bali because the long-term international agreement on climate policy must be implemented in the space of two years, the climate, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be postponed after 2012. In this case, the commitments to reduce below the values provided for in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by the need for a new international system of reductions.
The reduction in emissions would be delayed and the increase in the average temperature of the Earth by more than 2 degrees Celsius could no longer be avoided, which scientists say would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
British Army Recruits on YouTube
British Army units communicate on the video-sharing site recordings made during its operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in order to become popular.
First, it is the British Air Force (RAF) that has become passionate about YouTube: special forces in Afghanistan are uploading video footage of operations against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC reported.
These recordings, taken using miniature cameras mounted on the helmet, are controlled at the Air Force Operations Headquarters in Kandahar and then transferred to London or uploaded to the Internet by the compatriots.
The political message is indispensable
Air Force soldiers have already spent 139 sequences on the net via this route and their "chain" has been watched by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence signed up as "defenseheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 and it communicates videos of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan while the Commonwealth Office and the International Peacekeeping Forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own YouTube channels.
Mission in Afghanistan
According to the initial objective of the air force, the videos were passed on the net to recruit. According to the Ministry of Defense, they also served to make known to the general public the real objectives of the presence of the army abroad.
The propaganda published in this way costs practically nothing compared to the usual recruitment advertisements passed on television, Gordon Mackenzie, a defence consultant, told the BBC, but it also inevitably carries a political message since it justifies in a special form the validity of the military operations decided by the government.
The Americans made a game.
The army is annoyed because, apart from the carefully composed and censored videos, amateur videos are passed on the sharing site that also present, for example, the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a little hypocritical, the officers do not avoid talking about the losses but they never present the fighting side.
In fact, many videos had already gone online showing areas of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan that were carried out on a real mission, but the British army has only recently been packing for the upload of these videos.
The Americans make the recruitment a little different by using the shooting game America's Army downloadable for free. In this game the player can put himself directly in the place of the soldiers as part of a more or less real simulation.
Christmas tombola and donuts in ministries
Labour minister M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperth does not seem to be sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold a year-end meeting with her employees who will be able to say goodbye to the year 2007 by taking donuts and coffee.
Another ministry will organize a party with live music, another will enchant officials with a tombola and offer a drink to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet, so the power is entertained.
Public authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
This year, the largest Christmas party will be organized by the Ministry of Defence, but it is not the employees of the ministry who will be invited.
At Christmas, the children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts, for the missionary Christmas, the family members of the soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also take place.
The ministry plans a budget of 25 million forints to create the end-of-year atmosphere.
In comparison with other ministries, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will celebrate.
The GKM festival will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of 4,320,000 forints and, of the six hundred employees in bulk, three hundred and fifty are expected there.
At this party, the Christmas atmosphere will be rigor, there will be actors and also a tombola.
The Christmas of the NFÜ cost 4,700,000 forints and was held Wednesday in the building of the National Council of Justice (ILO) with concerts and a dinner.
The rental of the room cost a million forints, the rest was spent for the more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, a service of the NFÜ is invited to another Christmas party which is organized with European money by the National Centre for Economic Development, the tender management company.
The building of the Thé<0xC3><0xA2>tre de la Ga<0xC3><0xAE>té was rented for these purposes.
This information has not been confirmed by MAG Zrt because we have not been able to reach the person responsible.
The costume is not mandatory.
The ILO building not only hosted the NFÜ but also the Ministry of Justice and Police which, instead of a Christmas party, organized a ball on the occasion of St. Luca on 7 December.
The ILO did not charge them for the use of its rooms.
The ball had 500 people.
The party began with the Minister's welcome words and the dinner was followed by a dance evening on live music.
Answer to the question of [origo]: the party was not mandatory at this ball at all.
The ministries of health, labour and local communities are preparing a sober party.
The Ministry of Health will organize a show and a party for its employees, in its walls, for 400,000 forints.
Labour Minister M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperth, on the other hand, does not officially invite her employees to a Christmas party but to a work meeting at the end of the year.
One hundred and eighty people are expected to be invited to have coffee and eat doughnuts, the press service said, and the party will cost only 350,000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Government, will simply invite his collaborators to have a drink in the hall of the Ministry of Local Government and Territorial Planning.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will host a Christmas party in its large hall at which 436 employees are expected.
It plans to spend 2,500 forints per guest including a buffet and a glass.
Since the arrival of J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres, PM employees celebrate Christmas in the same way every year.
No festive atmosphere is planned, the official character is reinforced not only by the Minister's presentation but also by the time of the holiday taking place in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will organize a reception on January 20 to celebrate the New Year, the Christmas holiday will not take place.
The reception will be held at Vajdahunyad Castle, located in the City Woods, and according to the ministry's communication, 1,000 forints per person are calculated for the hundred guests.
According to the press service, this will be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, are started with a few words of welcome from the minister followed by a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture are not celebrating Christmas at all, the respective press services reported to [origo].
The press service of the Ministry of the Environment did not know the price of the official Christmas holiday.
However, more than four hundred people were invited to the party organized at the Museum of Decorative Art.
The forces of the mega-strike are gathering
The unions of the League and the National Association of Workers' Councils will form their strike committee on Friday, which will be responsible for coordinating Monday's indefinite strike.
On Saturday, a general assembly of protests will be held and on Monday, the day of the final vote on the law on health funds, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly cause significant traffic jams as rail traffic will be stopped almost completely and employees of BKV (public transport company) will also strike until 1 p.m.
The unions of the League will announce, on Friday afternoon, the details of their strike on Monday, organized with the National Association of Workers' Councils.
The strike commission of LIGA - MOSZ will also be constituted, it will serve as the coordinator of Monday's actions.
On Saturday, a general assembly of protests will be held and, from Monday, organizations joining the strike will stop work indefinitely if they fail to reach an agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, from the day of the vote in parliament on the law on health funds, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not pass the Health Funds Act, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for strikes.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide what action to take.
According to the National Assembly's Monday agenda, it is likely that the vote on the Health Funds Act will only take place late in the evening, or even at night.
Due to the planned strike for Monday, major traffic jams are planned: railways will stop work for an indefinite period and during the morning part of public transport in Budapest and more than half of Vol<0xC3><0xA1>n companies are likely to be stopped.
At the same time, at different points in the country, half the track will also be blocked.
Many trade unions and civil organizations have joined the call for strikes, the list of which is constantly updated on the League's website.
Some organizations report that they are going on strike for an indefinite period of time, while others have declared a temporary cessation of work.
Until Thursday afternoon, the M<0xC3><0x81>V (Hungarian Railways) and the Free Railways Union (VDSZSZ) failed to reach an agreement on minimum services, and as Christmas approaches, more and more people are taking the train.
According to current communications, Budapest public transport will strike from the start of service until 13h, Budapest airport between 7h and 9h in the morning, the Industrial Unions of Electricity and Thermal Energy of the League will strike for four hours respectively, the Union of Teachers and the Union of Democra
The National Association of Physicians will strike across the country alternatingly, the Union of Health and Social Workers (EDDSZ) attached to the SZEF will strike a two-hour warning.
The most important of the four demands, formulated by the League, requires the government to withdraw its proposal for health reform and submit a new conception to the social debate.
The second claim requires that the new method of calculating the pension to be implemented from next year be introduced in several stages.
The third claim seeks a guarantee of retirement before the legal age, which would allow for the transfer into the system of functions that deserve it before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Free Railways Union (VDSZSZ), attached to the League Unions, of the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport concerning secondary railway lines and the expectation of another proposal.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard has increased country risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital (Risk Analyzing Division), the activity of the Hungarian Guard, formed last August with the support of Jobbik Magyarorsz<0xC3><0xA1>gért Mozgalom (Movement for a Better Hungary), increases the political risk of Hungary and the region in several aspects.
In its “risk warning”, the company points out that, in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is already that “in the short term aggressive ethnic clashes can occur following the aggravation of the already existing ethnic tension between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy populations of Hungary”.
The research institute added that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy likely to provoke this situation is the main reason.
As they say, this is explained by one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political actors: "public actors passed the public debate on the Roma case to representatives of radical and extreme political groups who based a political strategy on the dispute between Gypsies and Hungarians".
The problem is aggravated, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are strengthened and the arrival of aggressive conflicts is more likely, they say.
However, according to the research institute, under the effect of the increased attention of the Hungarian and international media, the activity of the Hungarian Guard “has significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, in particular regarding the confidence in the stability and democratic maturity of the country”.
They recall that, following increased publicity for the reorganization of Hungarian radical and far-right groups since the fall of 2006, many associations have been established in Hungary since the summer of 2007, calling themselves the “National Self-Defense Association”.
“The common feature of these rallies is that they define themselves as a civilian organization while publicly declaring the preparation of their members for defense missions (disasters, national defense, defense of the order), armed if necessary, moreover, referring to the incapacity of the police, the army, in other words, the state,” they added.
They reported that everything was done according to the method that, based on the rancour of the society of politics and parties, seeks to disguise different political ambitions under a civil aspect.
The emphasis on the civil character and the status of association is therefore only used to avoid the legal traps of the registration of these associations in court, but they are also a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor that also increases the risk in relation to neighbouring relations.
“In recent months, many neighbouring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of risk and ultra-nationalist political actors in some neighbouring countries want to justify their anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the constitution of the Hungarian Guard.
This affects the political stability of the region,” they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, political risks have increased over the entire region.
As they say, the operation of the Hungarian Guard resembles, for example, the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The numerous disturbances of the Roma that broke out in a district of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) are at the origin of the constitution of the Bulgarian guard.
Taking advantage of these events, the BNU decided to constitute a guard, saying that the organization's goal is "national self-defense".
According to them, in the last 17 years, the gypsies have "terrorized" Bulgaria but the state has remained inactive and neutral, recalls the Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had sparked heated debates in Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement of some Bulgarian Roma organizations regarding the constitution of their own guard as resistance points to an increased risk of ethnic clashes.
The operation of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities to that of the Bulgarian National Guard does not exclude that Hungarian Roma respond to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defense, can be read in the risk warning of Political Capital.
At the request of the telegraph agency, Attila Juh<0xC3><0xA1>sz, research director of Political Capital, said: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, their risk analysis is published every year and if events occur that could have an impact on the change in risk, they inform the public, as in this case, by publishing a risk warning.
The party is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the holidays and, around the holidays, it has become common to reorganize the working days, the number of which will decrease next year.
The holidays are not uniform in the EU and the US either.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes national and state holidays as well as rest days.
Rest days are often associated with religious holidays or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the new year, the last day of the year that ends and the first day of the new year are also days of rest, the latter all the more so that the newcomers can rest quietly.
In one year, we have eleven festivals marked in red.
March 15 is a national holiday, commemorating the revolution of 1848, as well as October 23, which is the commemorative day of the 1956 revolution.
On August 20, we celebrate the constitution of our state, May 1 is the Labor Day and on November 1 and 2, we remember the members of our family and our deceased friends.
In addition, we have two days at Easter, at Pentecost and at Christmas.
The days of our state holidays, national or even religious rarely fall on a weekend, according to the calendar, it has become common to reorganize the working days in cases where there is only one working day left before or after the holiday marked in red.
It is true that we pay the price for extended weekends by working or going to school on the Saturday before the extended weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has enacted special regulations on the replacement days of the days before or after the holidays.
The Act extends to all employers and their employees, to civil servants and to persons working in the public service.
It does not, however, apply to service companies, institutions running without interruption and in service, by their vocation, and also to rest days.
This year, the working days will be changed only around the end of the year holidays: from December 24, life stops almost throughout the country because according to experiences the majority of people rather do overtime or take vacations that they have saved for these purposes so that they can spend the days between Christmas and New Year's day at home.
Next year many holidays fall in the middle or at the end of the week, therefore there will be fewer changes in the level of working days compared to this year.
The schedule will be reorganized for the first time around Labor Day to allow employees to stay at home for four days in a row.
Saturday, April 25th will be a working day to have a rest day on Friday, May 2nd.
Another change is planned for 23 October: Saturday 18 October will be a working day replacing Friday 24.
On the other hand, next year, the end of the year is announced under the sign of holidays because from December 24, everyone will take a non-stop break even if the day of the new year falls on a Wednesday.
Six Unnecessary Things That Can Hurt Your Colleagues
Emails we forget to send, voicemails we never receive, innocent lies that annoy us almost more: these are things that “beautify” the daily life of a workplace.
The question is whether to get used to these problems or take up the challenge and consciously avoid ambiguous situations, causing trouble to others.
Examples.
“Excuse me, I forgot to tell you you were called to the marketing department,” a colleague told you.
That you missed an appointment?
At best he is sorry and tries to fix things by calling the marketing department to tell them that he forgot to pass the message (this is the least common solution).
In most cases, the matter is settled with apologies.
Before you have any painful explanations, it is helpful to think about how you can cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and make efforts to avoid them.
Do you borrow something that doesn’t belong to you?
There’s nothing more annoying than wanting to take a folder, an office tool, or the phone and you can’t find them anywhere.
Do you remember the day before you put the stapler on the desk but it disappeared the next morning?
Do you happen to find your pen that you thought was lost on your colleague's desk?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking, or they're right to be mad at you for picking up their property.
Do not bring envelopes, post-it in your pocket because it can be annoying that there are no more and you need them right away.
Do you care about the privacy of your colleagues?
There are no good ways to stop the spreading of rotten things.
Who did what, with whom?
Or and why?
Do not tell everyone your information (suppositions) about the privacy of your colleagues!
If a colleague shares his intimate secrets with you, do not abuse his trust!
Bury the shared information in yourself and do not discuss it with your colleagues in their absence even if your colleagues are also aware of it.
Are you claiming to be ill for no good reason?
When you call the office and declare yourself sick under the pretext of a tearing headache because you feel sick or you feel in need of rest that day, think about the fact that your work, your urgent business, your future missions must be performed by someone else in your place.
Don’t bother your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you are not going to work or that something can happen that would force you to stay at home, remember to warn your boss and colleagues to prevent them from being surprised by your absence the next day.
Chilling, squeezing, telephone
You get into your job, but your co-workers snatch you out of it?
You became, unintentionally, a witness to a phone conversation that you'd be better off not listening to?
Don’t disturb your colleagues with squealing, cantoning, loud conversations (which you carry over their heads), footsteps, big words, or dissatisfaction expressed out loud.
They can disturb even if your colleagues are not immersed in a project (writing, design, organization).
Are you blaming others for a fault?
If your work is not done for the set deadline, you forget to send an important mail or message, do not blame anyone for this forgetting!
Don't put it on account of the possible chaos in the office or your noisy colleagues!
Recognize it if you have made a mistake and if it has presented inconveniences for others, fix the mistake!
Ask how you could fix your fault, fix the negligence!
Do you feel too much at home in the office?
Putting on a jogging and slippers is comfortable at home but they are not suitable for the office!
Don’t put on comfortable jogging even if your function allows it!
Do not be neglected, respect your colleagues and yourself by dressing properly, and if your job requires it by putting on nice and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to meet expectations, you are no longer interesting
We move slowly into the usual morning stopper.
Suddenly, a particular melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin with which electronic effects are associated.
I'm making the sound.
The music changes pace and the bass comes to accompany the tones on time, then a female choir joins it as a real jewel.
Mr2 released the song Wings of Love by Zagar.
The Hungarian musical life has not spoiled us for a long time with a good quality electronic pop.
Now it seems that the cap becomes different if you listen to Zagar's new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the few interesting new productions born from the Hungarian digital underground are gradually beginning to change the overall picture and, despite the new style of garage rock tearing the guitar, the Hungarian electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger arrived from Pécs and he played himself in the Yonderboi group before he started on his own track, perhaps because "there is no room for two feet in the same shoe".
His project (Zagar) and his music, an ally of jazz, electronic dance music and pop, began to become known when he was entrusted with the composition of the filmed soundtracks (e.g.
La saison de Ferenc Török).
The formation playing in small clubs was beginning to be known to a wider audience when wan2 magazine named their first album of 2002 among the fifty most important records on the Hungarian market and proclaimed Zagar, with Yonderboi, the almost only creators of the Hungarian trend who would also be competitive in the west.
Zagar and his ensemble became undeniably “trendy” but no one asked them if they wanted to wear this label.
The band reacted properly and released a new and better album.
The album Cannot Walk Fly Instead, released recently, may open new avenues for them, although the title wishes to represent a continuity with the years spent in Pécs.
It was a line of the old group of Pécs de Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger.
We are fine with the reference to flight but next to the aerial music now appears, according to the spirit and trend of the time, the strongest guitar, impact of rock and roll.
György Ligeti, singer currently working in England with the band The Puzzle, showed his talent in these songs during the debut of the album at the Millennium Park.
On the album, we find a real tube for the radio, mr2 Pet<0xC3><0xB5>fi, recently broadcasting popular music from morning to evening, began to introduce the melodies of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
Everything is fine (?).
hvg.hu asked Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger questions.
hvg.hu: This new tube pushes me to ask a question: did your music remain a music aimed at a certain layer?
Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs: The term music for a certain layer doesn’t tell me much.
For me there are two castes in light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but commercial music and sincere music.
So-called alternative, underground music can also be mediocre and made only to sell them and thus become commercial.
But a good pop song can be sincere, too.
The reception attitude also works in this spirit regardless of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between Hungarian and foreign audiences, is one or the other more open to your music?
Zs.B.: Abroad, especially in the west, light music has older traditions.
There, people go to concerts and not only young people of ten or twenty years but also the oldest.
They follow the changes in light music with much more attention because they think that it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in who or how many people are listening to your music?
Zs.B.: I’m obviously happy to see more and more people coming to our concerts.
However, we have never made music for the market.
For us, music is not made to achieve a goal but for a specific reason.
The role of the public is more important at concerts or the mutual influence already works but it is perceived only in the elusive changes of the moment.
Now, I noticed that if you wanted to meet the expectations of the public, you would no longer be interesting.
hvg.hu: Are you going to follow Yonderboi's example?
He works alone and has made a career rather in the west.
Zs.B.: We don’t really follow his path even though sometimes some people try to find traces in our music.
Rather, we are team players who trust each other’s musical presence and let it unfold.
At first, it was inevitable that our music would be compared to Yonderboi’s because there are many of us leaving his band and taking a different path.
hvg.hu: On mr2 Pet<0xC3><0xB5>fi's palmares, Wings of Love occupies the first place.
Many have heard the name Zagar for the first time through this song.
With this more popular style you have consciously opened up to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We did not plan to make a tube to be able to sell the record.
This song means more than that.
We wanted it for the end of the album to try to soften the orgy of sounds and more difficult themes addressed throughout the record.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why they - what was the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel choir.
We had the idea to compose this choir of good soloists from the Hungarian music scene.
Thus was composed the six-member choir, namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik<0xC3><0xB5> Hodasi [Neo], Juci Németh, which was then called Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like that or did the girls change it a little?
Zs.B.: This track already existed for a long time in an instrumental version and then when we composed the album, we thought that there was still something missing from this song.
The successive chords attracted the voice of the song.
I sang at night the same melody that the girls learned later.
I had it almost immediately and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember that it galvanized me at the time but of course we needed the Divas.
With my voice, she wouldn't have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the record and at the concert it also seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo (except for a short Judy Jay solo), they don’t have a solo role, they all sing together and they don’t sing louder than the music, so the music doesn’t just accompany their singing.
They were behind the scene as well.
Is that what you want?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the background is due only to technical problems.
On the other hand, what was voluntary was that we did not want to distribute solo roles.
The song also says that we must forget our ego a little bit, forget who comes from where, who goes or, we just have to let these wings, the wings of love, take us away.
I wanted others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which of the songs made you work the most?
Zs.B.: In fact, none of the musical creation process, we had more difficult pieces when mixing.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or playing a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for a long time, and then, little by little, everything set up like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What’s your favorite thing about the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I’ve already “released” this record.
Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
Trader perfidious to risk billions because of its inferiority complex
A cover-up fraudster.
Its former employee, the French giant Société Générale, owns the Czech bank Komer<0xC4><0x8D>n<0xC3><0xAD> banka.
The bank lost nearly five billion euros due to him.
But it seems rather that Kerviel is only a great player who wanted to equal his colleagues, and who, in addition, can not be considered incapable.
Unlike all major banks, it recognized the crisis in the U.S. mortgage market in time.
"He is fragile," his superiors said, who reported him to the police.
However, if we stick to Kerviel's statement reported by the French media, including Le Monde, the man's transactions generated a profit of 1.6 billion euros at the end of last year.
The Crisis Exceeds the United States
“All I wanted was to make money for my bank,” he said in the statement.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the US crisis to earn half a billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity from the beginning of the year.
Information began to emerge in February that so-called "sub-prime" mortgages, granted to low-income customers or those who had encountered repayment difficulties in the past, would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the entire economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and he made a good bet.
Thus, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to 1.6 billion euros.
"As soon as I won my first half-billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel said, adding that he hadn't kept anything for himself.
Throughout the interrogation, he confessed to having falsified the reports so as not to be tracked.
He managed to deceive his superiors, although the Eurex exchange began to take an interest in his transactions.
Who does not risk anything has nothing
Was he afraid to be discovered?
I don't think so.
"I felt that just getting $1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where does his willingness to take such a big risk come from?
He came to his post only gradually.
He started working at Société Générale in 2000, just after graduating from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already an assistant trader and, in 2005, he became an independent trader with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew he would never win as much as the others.
“From my first interview in 2005, I knew I was far less respected than the others.
With regard to my university degree and my professional and personal career," Kerviel told investigators.
Shortly after he took office, he achieved his first major success.
Thanks to Allianz’s shares, he won half a billion euros by betting on the decline of this title in the London attacks.
And the mechanism was triggered - he wanted more.
As long as you win, we leave you alone
“There was like a snowball effect,” he told police.
But the superiors were aware of everything, or rather, they doubted it.
"As long as I won, they pretended to close their eyes."
That is when the start of the year comes.
He loses a billion dollars in a day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decides to hide the amount.
On Monday, when he arrives at work, he is no longer employed by the bank.
A few days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5 billion euros due to him.
And how did we find out?
He became suspicious because of his vacations.
“Last year, I took only four days off.
A trader who doesn’t take a vacation is a trader who doesn’t want to leave his book to someone else,” concludes Kerviel.
The Czech Republic has the opportunity to get 365 billion
Yesterday, Czech government ministers signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the coming years, bring 14 billion euros (about 365 billion Czech crowns) to the Czech Republic.
This is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Nearly CZK 125 billion from seven operational programmes will be earmarked for Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion crowns under the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
The transport sector will benefit the most, up to 150 billion.
The Transport programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the financial resources that the Czech Republic can obtain from these projects.
This money will lead to an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage a sum of 90.8 billion crowns next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme, aimed at SMEs and entrepreneurs, should be used to obtain financial resources to encourage innovation within the enterprise.
Companies should obtain financial means for the introduction of new technologies, industry research, but also for the introduction of new, more effective management methods.
Until now, the Czech Republic was among the new members of the least successful beneficiaries of EU funds.
The Tribunal confirmed the sentence of 20 years in prison for the former president of Nicaragua
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeal on Thursday confirmed the sentence of 20 years in prison for former President Arnold Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n, to whom he was sentenced in 2003 for a fraud of $100 million (nearly 1.8 billion crowns).
However, he was later released and was assigned to reside in his hacienda near the capital of Nicaragua.
Whether or not the former head of this Central American state, in office between 1997 and 2002, will be incarcerated again is not clear at the moment, according to the AP agency.
According to the president of the Court of Appeal Ileana Pérez, everything will now depend on prison officers, either they will let German finish his sentence at home, or go back to prison.
Four years ago, the Tribunal proved that Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n regularly moved government money to the accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These were fictitious companies and the accounts were actually owned by his family members and his closest supporters.
Some of this money went to the funds Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n had created to fund his election campaign in 2001.
The budget has been adopted
That's the way it is.
The state budget was adopted.
How is this budget exceptional?
This is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the government majority without the support of the opposition.
The one for the current year passed a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, since it was Minister Sobotka who had prepared it and <0xC4><0x8C>SSD could not afford to refuse it.
Contrary to the agitated debate leading up to the vote of no confidence in the government, this time, nothing dramatic.
The House of Representatives passed this law without any problems, which, although the most influential, is usually neglected.
This is a kind of paradox.
Whether we like it or not, each chapter and article is the beginning and end of any government.
The budget is a constituent part of politics, although it is hidden behind the competition of power between government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive in the media and that is why it is given more attention in the media.
The disputes of politicians are much more interested in opinion than in abrupt figures.
The national budgets of past socialist governments suffered from three ills that the current budget is not able to pay at the same time:
The first is the significant share of the costs of mandates imposed by law, consisting not only of pensions, but also of social charges, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M parties.
The second is a deficit economy, a consequence of the first evil.
The third obstacle is the deficit of public finances, i.e. the deficit of cities and municipalities.
However, it is not the state budget deficit that is the biggest problem.
It is public and relatively under control.
The real delay bomb is the deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors often issued, in obscurity, bonds, inordinately indebted to their municipalities, in order to obtain, apart from money from taxes, tax duties and bank credits, new sources of investment.
In past years, they succeeded in repaying these debts by selling in bulk the shares of the distribution systems, in particular those of energy, obtained from the State as part of privatizations.
Today, they no longer have that source.
Based solely on official and verifiable facts, it is found that:
Our economy has been going through a phase of growth for several years now, just like the rest of the world, and <0xC4><0x8C>SSD is not lacking.
It was a unique opportunity for successive governments of this party to regularize public finances.
Instead, they were indebted to the state more and more.
Other countries, with a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have handled their affairs in a much more reasonable way than our Republic.
It is a monstrous shame that falls mainly on previous governments.
We are among the countries that are least threatened by poverty on a global scale.
We therefore have no need for massive social programmes which have, unfortunately, become unnecessarily inflated in the last few years.
Although some of the preposterous populist spending approved last year before the elections has been eliminated, if there is not a delay in the age limit for retirement, as well as a reform of the pension system soon, then any policy will cease to exist in this country and whoever will be in power will only do so.
Hardly exaggerating, it can be said that the politicians in power will become bureaucrats mechanically distributing the majority of the money imposed between pensions and social benefits.
This is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism that causes ordinary costs to be postponed by mandate costs.
The planned $70 billion deficit for 2008 would be absolutely useless if previous governments had not dissipated all the money they could.
If we really do not want politicians in power to become mere bureaucrats, we need to be patient and grant this fragile government coalition, aware that the state can only spend the equivalent of what happens to be levied on taxes and taxes, the calm needed for the preparation of new reform laws.
Only the latter will make it possible to gradually achieve a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian central banks have decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
More than one hundred billion dollars will be put into the money markets through auctions.
It will be for banks to sell, through an auction system, the interest rates at which they are willing to borrow money.
As an example, the US Fed will auction off $40 billion and, in addition, it will provide $24 billion to the European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time since the attacks of 11 September that the central banks of individual states have decided to take such concerted action to prevent or even reduce the effects of the financial crisis.
“This approach tends to solve the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend,” writes Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group in his report to clients.
“The concerted action of the central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to about 50 percent,” Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to unrepaid loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further losses in billions.
“If the central banks have chosen this approach, it is that they must really understand what is still to come,” said ABN chief economist Amro Kieran Davies.
“It looks like the situation is really bad,” he added.
Central banks fear that, if banks themselves will have difficult access to loans, they will lend more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the U.S. economy into a recession that could affect economic growth around the world.
The central banks made this choice after they failed to bring down the interbank rate of London, called LIBOR, used to borrow in the interbank market.
This meant that the banks were still afraid of mutual loans, even though the US, Canadian and English central banks repeatedly lowered their interest rates in the fall.
"This will have the same effect as a further interest rate cut," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the approach of the central banks will not help to conjure up the crisis, since it does not solve the main problem that is the collapse of the US real estate market.
President Klaus: Ecologists’ Debates are Incredible
Global climate change is expected to be particularly detrimental to developing countries.
President V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus spoke again on the issue of global warming.
This time, criticism was levelled at the UN International Conference on Climate Change ending in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, Not Green, he said that the debates of environmentalists were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, made up of a curious mix of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, that is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and reality.
"The debate is not structured at all, it's just a rocket of words, a substitute for solutions to current problems," Klaus said.
During the presentation of his book, the Czech President stressed that his subject matter is of great importance to him and that is why he is so committed to this cause.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book also appears in German translation, since, he said, "I often only encounter the caricature of my opinions".
Now, interested people can read their positions without being deformed.
Klaus recalled that although he is not a climatologist, in his opinion he still has enough provisions to write such a book.
He is indeed an academic capable of following and appreciating scientific treatises, he has the practice of statistics and he is also an economist.
The main conclusions of the book are, in his opinion, the following theses: the climate is constantly changing, the changes of this are therefore normal, there is not an opinion shared by all researchers on global warming, the effects of current changes are neither too important nor too serious, they are not influencing, therefore they represent no danger and influencing.
Especially since he has the experience of a totalitarian regime, he considers it unacceptable to impose unverified opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous threat to freedom.
In response to questions from those present, he repeatedly explained that he was not against "reasonable environmental protection, but against an integrative environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between the costs and the profit they bring."
In Vienna, Klaus had already talked about this topic two months ago, at the Hayek Institute.
600 thousand people have not been able to renew their driving license in time
Six hundred thousand drivers have allowed the deadline to expire and have failed to renew their old driving licence, which expires at the end of the year.
We are the last day that people can still apply for renewal, so the authorities are in a position to issue them a new permit before the end of the year.
However, the Department is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without valid permits will take the road.
According to the authorities, they have not renewed their driving licences, especially those who do not want to drive anymore.
As municipalities report a drop in the number of applications for renewal of the permit, authorities in the capital are inundated with applications and the number of applications for renewal of the permit has gone up this week.
The City Council satisfies about 2000 customers per day.
There's a tail of about half an hour.
In Prague, nearly 140.OOO drivers have not yet renewed their driving licences.
The issuance of a new permit takes 20 days.
But it is possible to request the release within a shortened period of five days.
In this case, the driver pays an additional five hundred crowns.
Drivers who fail to renew their driver's license by the end of the year and take the road without a valid driver's license will face a fine as early as January.
The culprit will be forced to pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, the police officer may also treat the offence by amicable means.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine rises to 2500 crowns.
According to ancient information, even a person who was not going to circulate was liable to a fine.
In doing so, she could be forced to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry had called on the authorities to moderate and impose fines not exceeding 1000 crowns.
However, according to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka, no one risks fines in the tens of thousands.
According to him, the driver's license is a document that people can decide whether they want to have it or not.
It is not like with the identity card which, it, must be valid without exception.
People who no longer want to drive should hand over their driver’s license.
Just bring it or send it to the corresponding municipality.
Driver's licenses issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, drivers are also forced to gradually renew other types of driving licences.
Persons with documents from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to renew.
The validity of driving licences issued in the years 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million other documents.
The Tribunal has reduced the sentences of detectives contracted with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k, former police officers accused of collusion with David Berdych’s gang, will serve thirteen and ten years in prison, respectively.
The High Court in Prague thus sentenced them to a final sentence, reducing their sentences by 1 year and 2 years respectively.
Initially, detectives from the Department for the Suppression of Organized Crime were facing sentences of 14 and 12 years in prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal against the judgment delivered today, only an appeal to the High Court is possible.
Although Berdych is also charged in this case, he is awaiting only the first instance verdict for the time being.
However, he has already received more than 16 years in prison in other trials.
He cannot receive more.
In January, the Departmental Court found 19 people guilty of participating in hold-ups, and today the Superior Court dealt with the appeal interjections of 16 of them.
Most of the defendants, since the beginning of the investigation, questioned the charge, claiming that it was a manipulated case.
According to the Central Bohemian Court of Justice, the members of the police, after an agreement among others with Berdych, transmitted to the criminals information from police sources, covered the different hold-ups and helped the gang members to avoid criminal responsibility.
In return, the gang handed over 30 percent of the larcin to Opava and Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k.
The indictment refers to the gang's criminal activity in the years 1999 to 2001.
Essentially armed robbery, the victims of which have, in most cases, suffered serious health damage, but also abuse of power of a public official and prohibited weapons.
During the home searches, the police discovered illegally held pistols, shells with a steel core, a viewfinder for direct laser shooting or a machine gun.
According to the accusations, the gang has been enriched by tens of millions of crowns.
Apart from nearly 20 men in the trial, the courts have already found Berdych and a number of others guilty of other hand-held thefts.
Other men from Berdych's neighborhood are still explaining themselves before the court in another trial, some cases have not yet reached the court.
The main hearing has so far avoided Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> P<0xC5><0xAF>ta and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej, who are currently in detention in Ireland, where they are awaiting the final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
The price of child replacement: 12 million
Igor Veleba, a lawyer for the families of the victims, wants to get a compensation of 12 million crowns from the hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>, plus the costs.
Three million for each of the mothers, two million for the fathers and one million for each of the children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each of the parents.
That is why Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l's hospital lawyer absolutely disagrees with Veleba's proposal.
"We refuse such a claim, this one is very, very high," Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l said at the exit of the hearing.
"To be able to make an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need the expert report from which the opposing party ordered the drafting.
We will check if it has any explanatory value.
But we continue to think that the total amount should not exceed hundreds of thousands," Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l said.
According to him, the amount should be fixed between 100,000 and 200,000 K<0xC4><0x8D> for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov's family demanded one million crowns for each month where she could not raise her biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, prepared for him by the University Hospital Center in Prague-Motol, as a document in support of the compensation negotiations.
According to experts in psychology and psychiatry, the parents suffered psychological damage and were subject to stress at different scales and depths.
The stress situation was better endured by men, although they were faced with remorse for not being able to prevent the replacement of newborns.
Women, they, remain less serene in the face of the trauma in the news and in the face of what is happening right now, summarized the content of the Veleba report.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> on December 9.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola at the <0xC4><0x8C>erm<0xC3><0xA1>k in P<0xC5><0x99>ibyslavice and Veronika at Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslava Trojanov<0xC3><0xA1> in Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov.
The governor of the Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina region Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Vystr<0xC4><0x8D>il gave, at the end of October, to each of the families 100,000 crowns for the reimbursement of expenses caused by the mistake of the hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> managed by the region.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are required by law to have civil liability insurance.
In case of failure, they must draw on the reserve fund, exceptionally, they can ask for help from the manager.
Until now, the courts recognized relatively low compensation, the amounts calculated according to the tables were in the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Soup and Pear of the Kingdom of Wallachia (with the Royaume de Wallachia)
Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka a perdu le litige au suu de la marque The Kingdom of Wallachia (Royaume de Wallachia).
According to the judge of the Ostrava regional court, he had actually used the title of King of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko for the first time, but the project was set up by the team around Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, former collaborator of the actor.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka was not present at today's hearing.
However, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team parasitize on the popularity of Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka," Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, the words Kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko evoke to everyone precisely this actor and comedian.
Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> is of the same opinion.
“There’s a job behind us that’s been almost ten years.
Searching for money and developing events," he said.
According to him, money is the cause of the dispute.
"After years, they realized that the project was successful and that they could benefit from it.
They are the ones who want to parasitize on our work,” he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, it was Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka who first used the title vala<0xC5><0xA1>sk<0xC3><0xBD> kr<0xC3><0xA1>l (King of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko) in his TV show.
The actor Radoslav Brzobohat<0xC3><0xBD> had crowned him king in 1993.
However, at the time, it had nothing to do with the project of setting up a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> came up with the idea of issuing passports from the Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lovstv<0xC3><0xAD>.
From a humorous action originally emerged a lucrative business and commercial activity, followed by the creation, by Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, of the company Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské kr<0xC3><0xA1>lovstv<0xC3><0xAD>.
In 1997 Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka accepted that his name and signature be quoted in the passport and even offered to the holders of the sale on the price of the visit of his farm and his theater performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> only used the bare idea, published by Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka in the show mane<0xC5><0xBE>, for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka and certainly helped the project Wallachian Kingdom," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was made up of Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team who devoted themselves intensely to the project.
Collaboration between the now-enemy parties continued until 2000, when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized an official coronation for Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka in Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n.
But from there, conflicts began to accumulate between Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, which culminated in the deposition of "King Boleslav 1st elected forever".
The leading role in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, assumed by singer Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>ul<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> as Queen Mother.
Then, in 2002, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka filed a complaint against Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his company, a request that the court rejected today.
What could make the case clear is the tournament envisaged for the throne and a half of the princess.
There should be a new king out of it.
He didn't want to betray the details and the date yet.
“We don’t want to go fast.
It would be something like the royal parade in Slov<0xC3><0xA1>cko.
The king would be elected for a time.
Even Mr. Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka can of course register," added Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
Test of the Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: disappearance of prejudices
I have never been a huge fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its rolling qualities were nothing extraordinary, the quality of the change of speed, of the driving and also that of the manufacture could, in many respects, be described as inferior to the average.
However, its successor, the Peugeot 207, is currently on the market, which is significantly better.
Especially since the combi named SW goes one step further, I just have to think about it better.
When I was testing the classic hatchback of the Peugeot 207, I complained, for example, about headroom in the rear seats.
While there finish the complaints because the bodywork means that even the big devils will be, in this regard, comfortable.
Let's see quickly done
I will talk about the interior very quickly so as not to repeat myself too much.
This is a pretty successful design, my only remark about the central tunnel that seems poor to me.
There, I would have liked a slightly more inventive design, since the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the time when one could complain about seats or backpacks too short is over.
The lateral guidance has also been significantly improved compared to the model 206.
As for the space, the increase in the dimensions of the body is noticeable there too.
The combi also sees the lack of space above the already mentioned head disappear.
A safe in the safe
The most important thing about this vehicle is its luggage compartment.
I have to evaluate this as very accessible (also thanks to the rear pivoting ice) and a rather easy locking.
The blind spaces are equipped with stopping elastics that constitute an ideal compromise.
It is not bulky and can be extended while being able to hold fairly heavy objects.
But let’s stop at the volume.
This makes, according to the tables, 428 l in the basic configuration, which is a rather average figure compared to the competition.
Apart from the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia Combi, the best-selling vehicle in this category in the Czech Republic.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product of Mlada Boleslav, we can see that the Peugeot remains very significantly behind, the difference being 52 liters.
When it comes to going on vacation abroad or loading a stroller, this figure is almost critical.
But, if I were to highlight the advantages, I would mention the undercarriage remaining after the reversal of the backrests of the rear seats perfectly straight, or a very low stepped.
120 horses spread over four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with a four-cylinder Otto engine with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And to be honest, that’s what a 1.6 should look like that makes a family hatchback run.
It is quiet, consumes little and, above all, it grows well.
If I compare it to the equivalent produced by <0xC5><0xA0>koda which often gives the impression of having an exhaust tank clogged by a serpentine, then I can only be enthusiastic about it.
Let's go through the rates
The price of the vehicle is not affordable for everyone.
However, we must be aware that we have tested a fairly well-equipped car, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with an Otto 1.4-litre engine of 329,900 K<0xC4><0x8D> is still affordable.
The vehicle we tested costs from 410 900 K<0xC4><0x8D>, which is already enough.
The Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price by 80,000 CZK.
In addition to head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wipers, automatic control of the rear windows...
In reality, the vehicle costs 531 900 K<0xC4><0x8D>.
That's a lot, but try adding the extra equipment to the price of the Fabia and you'll get a very similar figure.
All that remains is to choose the brand.
The integration of Slovak pupils in British schools is bad
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is increasing, which raises concerns among the remainder about the evolution of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently facing a number of obstacles.
British schools even see cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of natives turn into violence.
The case of North Kent, where the conflict between the remaining and immigrants of Slovak origin is beginning to escalate, is a good example of the problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe.
Disputes, bullying and student quarrels have transposed into relationships between parents.
The situation has gone so far that police arrested a Slovak woman in Chatham who hit a ten-year-old student with an iron rod.
The culprit defends herself by claiming that the boy had insulted him with racist words.
Police also had to intervene following the attack on a Slovak immigrant led by two teenage girls.
The girls allegedly made racist remarks to the man and threw stones at him.
“When we were coming home, a young man climbed the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop, he responded with apples and pears and then he discovered his buttocks," another nasty adventure described a mother of Slovak students.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One of the others went so far as to call conflicts with immigrants a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above show that the atmosphere in British schools between natives and immigrants is beginning to be tense.
70,000 Slovaks who came to find work are registered in Britain.
And about 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Everything you expect from your vacation can come true if you make the right choice.
Golden and white beaches like snow, high waves or a calm sea like a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with servers offering you on the beach a pizza, ice cream or intoxicating cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you will not find this list only in its entirety, but enriched.
However, there is only one island on which you will find much more and it is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island in the Greater Antilles.
By the time of the Spaniards, Cuba had been the bastion of their invasion of America.
Christopher Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became the deposit and transshipment place of the treasures that the Spaniards had stolen and that they were transporting to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built in the early 20's.
It was Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the American mafia, who built it, since everything that was a crime in the US (especially under prohibition) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his clients were, among other things,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, tall buildings grew and cars, belonging to the cult symbols of the 50s of the last century, circulated on the wide boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and, in Cojimar, he had his yacht.
Show business stars and politicians from across America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana.
In the bar of the Nacional Hotel, a luxury hotel, we will mix the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars are still circulating in Havana, since the jigouli and fiats that were once imported have long since rotted, in such a salty and humid climate.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is substantially decrepit, nowhere else in the vicinity are there as many splendid colonial monuments as there are there.
Other places become more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
Since tourism brings the money if necessary, its development has the green light.
Over the past fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varadero, on the coast of the Holgu<0xC3><0xAD>n province, and also on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique in the world and that will be appreciated especially by lovers of small trains.
The cane had returned from the extended plantations in the candy shops on a narrow lane by small steam and motor trains.
Their rolling stock has not been renewed for decades and this is how small locomotives can be seen running, the contemporaries of which are elsewhere only in museums.
To where to direct his steps?
The majority of visitors do not miss the most well-known places.
So there is no need to write much about Varadero or Havana.
If not, remember that in the Hemingway property, already mentioned, there is a museum and that whoever loves this writer should not miss the visit.
The Vi<0xC5><0x88>ales Valley to the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
Exuberant vegetation grows there on a limestone soil.
Mogots, limestone balloons and rocks rise in candles from the bottom of the valley, and, having taken fertile earth in their bowels, even its rotten rocks are covered with a very dense vegetable carpet.
The valley is probably the place where Cuban tobacco of the highest quality is grown.
You will be able to meet the final form of this product if you visit one of the cigar factories in Havana.
Someone may also find it interesting that this is where the Chilean episode of Major Zeman was shot.
Trinidad (disambiguation)
Ancient city founded shortly after the Spaniards colonized the island.
It was the slave trade and the sugar trade that brought him glory and wealth.
The wealth was embodied in the beauty and city-window character of this small-sized city.
The colonial Spanish architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray mountain range, is a place so remote that still in the 50's of the last century, there was no road that would connect this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay away.
Nothing was built, and that's why we didn't demolish anything either, everyone just had a roof over their head.
If you have more time than an afternoon in Trinidad, then it is also worth going to see interesting places in the area, such as Playa Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n or the Sucreries Valley.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la M<0xC3><0xBA>sica, which comes to life after sunset and where the music only deafens in the early morning.
Baracoa
Some refer to this town located in the far east of Cuba as the most beautiful on the island.
This opinion is certainly already influenced by the path that leads to it.
The two roads that lead from Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo have to cross high and rugged mountains and cross a landscape with almost no signs of human activity.
UNESCO has inscribed the eastern stool of Cuba, thanks to its intact landscape, on the World Heritage List.
The best chocolate is made there, in the church, there is the cross of Christopher Columbus (in fact, it was born about a hundred years after the Columbus trip) and from the hill where the old castle and the current hotel El Castillo stand, you can see several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountain range, the Bay of Sausages and the Island of Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the patron saint of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, the African religions practiced by the descendants of the ancient slaves could fill a number of pages, about all celebra
But, as they say, it’s better to see it once.
In Afghanistan, the allies are passive, the Americans say
The lack of troops and necessary equipment, according to the United States, influences the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
Defense Secretary Robert Gates said NATO should outline a concrete plan for the years to come.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going as it should, the representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing opposition of the Taliban movement, the eight states involved today also discuss future plans and the coordination of the allies.
While the United States called this week through Defense Secretary Robert Gates NATO troops to greater activity, Britain sees strengthening the Afghan government’s authority and intensifying development aid as a priority.
“Evolution in Afghanistan is perceptible, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow the inhabitants to start a new development of the economy and security themselves," British Defence Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety-nine percent
The activity of Afghan insurgents is, according to U.S. military data, the most intense in the last five years.
The number of violent acts increased by 27 per cent from last year to 60 per cent in Helmand province, in the south of the country.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, almost a quarter of them in the southern part.
However, according to the United States, the Allies have reached their absolute limit both in the organization and in the equipment of the troops.
In concrete terms, they are asking for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
"We will have to think seriously about concrete goals for the coming period, as well as ways to achieve them," Gates said.
NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop made similar remarks today.
“I’m not happy with what we have on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that’s not enough,” De Hoop told Reuters at the end of talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo lasting three days.
Who is passive
The past few months have also been a time of conflict among the countries involved over whether all the allies are actually doing their best in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, has been criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, so the combat requirements they are subject to are not as stringent as those in the southern and eastern parts of the country where we operate,” Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun called the German soldiers lazy this week.
"The lazy Afghans discovered: the Germans are playing, while ours are fighting," Sun wrote in a document supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild went on to counterattack by publishing a photo of a British team during a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
Government Debt Will Rise to $1 Billion in 2009
The burden of a state debt exceeding 84,000 crowns is incumbent on each Czech.
Total debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns at the end of September.
The government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
Thanks to a better-than-expected evolution of the State budget savings, the Ministry has reduced the planned amount to CZK 152.8 billion.
The debt of the state of the Czech Republic rose towards the end of September to 842.7 billion crowns.
During the nine months of this year it therefore increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
However, as of June, it decreased by 13.4 billion crowns.
Today, the Ministry of Finance has confirmed its data on state debt dating back to early October.
The burden of a debt exceeding 84,000 crowns is incumbent on each Czech.
During the whole of last year, the state indebted more than 111 billion crowns.
“At the moment, it seems that, thanks to a smaller deficit planned for next year, we could cross the border of one trillion crowns only in 2009.
Next year, the debt is expected to be between 900 billion and one billion crowns," Patria Finance analyst David Marek told the server iHNed.cz.
Next Finance analyst Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Pikor’s prediction is similar: “We could exceed the trillion by the year 2009.
The exact date will depend on the next budget that is not yet known.
If it appeared that the situation on the political scene was changing, that policies were ready to save more, the date could be postponed to 2010.
But I don’t expect that change,” he said.
Debts are growing
The debt of the State is constituted by the debts of the central government and it is mainly generated by the accumulation of deficits of the state budget.
The government's debt is financed by treasury bonds, annuity bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans to the European Investment Bank.
The state's domestic debt has increased this year for the moment from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The foreign debt of the state has increased this year for the moment from 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
The debt of the so-called negotiable state reached 803.3 billion crowns at the end of September and from June it decreased by 13.7 billion crowns.
The average debt-to-Government requirement was 6.5 years.
"Total debt increased year-on-year from the first to the third half by 13 percent, which is, given the current good health of the economy, a figure far too high.
Interestingly, the increase is mainly generated by pension securities where it reaches 20 percent.
It’s bad that debt is growing, but on the other hand it indicates that there will be material to negotiate when pension reform comes,” Pikora said.
Better than what we expected
It follows from the government's debt financing and management strategy for 2007 that the government had planned to borrow CZK 159.2 billion this year.
However, at the beginning of September, thanks to a better-than-expected evolution of the state budget savings, the ministry reduced the planned amount to 152.8 billion crowns.
The sum consists mainly of the state budget deficit, which will obviously reach 76 billion crowns this year, instead of the 91.3 billion crowns originally planned.
Secondly, these are the maximum sources foreseen for the Czech Consolidation Agency, i.e. CZK 13.3 billion, the reserve of CZK 10 billion for the payment of pensions, the financing of state pension securities for CZK 43 billion and the repayment of loans from the European Investment Bank amounting to CZK 1.8 billion.
She appeared in court today in Khartoum for naming a teddy bear
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced by a Khartoum court on Thursday night to 15 days in prison and expulsion, her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of letting 6- to 7-year-olds give the name Mohammed to a teddy bear while any depiction of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
She was liable to a fine of whiplash.
The 54-year-old British schoolteacher from Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested Sunday at her home and charged with assaulting Islam and sedition under Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code following several complaints from parents of students to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually goes back to September, when this teacher asked her students, aged 6/7, to choose a name for the teddy bear in the class.
“Eight names come out of the mouths of children, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” says school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohamed as their favorite first name.
Mohammed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
The children then made a book for the class with the photo of the bear followed by the legend "My name is Mohamed".
The bear itself did not bear any labels with that name, but the problem is simply that of representing the prophet as an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, teaching at the same school in Sudan, said he knew her well and that she would never have done anything that might be insulting to a religious faith, "I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name", he said.
The teacher’s opinion was shared by many students who described her as “very attentive to her students” and “who never talks about religion in class”.
Recall that the name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Britain, it is written in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the Prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
Can you give it to a toy?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
They failed to reach an agreement on the future status of the province at the last negotiating session in Vienna on Wednesday.
In the end, failure.
Kosovo Serbs and Albanians concluded a sixth and final round of talks Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, without being able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
“It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the status,” European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was “at stake”, its American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to honour their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
"We do not expect violence immediately, but we are entering a very difficult period," he added, noting that "obvious tensions exist."
End of mediation on December 10
The mediators of the troika, which includes the European Union, the United States and Russia, will travel to Serbia and Kosovo for the last time on Monday.
The future of the 90% Albanian-speaking province could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by December 10.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, constituted the sixth and last negotiation session since the troika was tasked with further mediation by the UN last August.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation to end on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked the Security Council from granting independence to Kosovo, insist on continuing negotiations beyond this deadline.
“Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution,” said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Declaration of Unilateral Independence? <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
After eight years of UN administration in Kosovo, Westerners believe that independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina says it is ready to declare it unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in its favour.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy.
“Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached,” Kosovo Autonomous Authority President Fatmir Sejdiu said at the Baden hotel, where “last chance negotiations” have been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province, expressed his regrets.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade “belonged to a past that led to murders and deportations.”
"Domino effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadic, for his part, felt that a compromise was still possible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of independence of the province.
Belgrade said it feared a “domino effect” in a region still weakened by the independence wars of the 1990s.
“For Serbia,” he said, “this does not mean that a compromise is impossible.”
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision be returned exclusively to the Security Council, where its Russian ally has a veto right.
"The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word"
“Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia,” Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
“These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end as they started: in the Security Council.”
Fatmir Sedjiu told reporters that "the Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word on the status", adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by Albanian speakers would be "in consultation" with the Westerners.
Bush pulls deal between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, at the opening of the international peace conference held by him on Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately enter into negotiations to find a final settlement to the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do anything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must dismantle “terrorist infrastructure” and Israel must end its colonization activities, Bush said, reminding both sides of their obligations under the “roadmap” for peace that they accepted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would aim "to conclude a peace treaty resolving all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues."
This appellation covers the three thorny issues at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees driven from their homes in what is now the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the US president, Abbas insisted that the upcoming negotiations be “global and thorough” and cover all aspects of a settlement, citing “Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others.”
In turn, Olmert pledged to make the upcoming talks "direct and continuous" and to make "an effort to close them in the course of 2008".
At the end of 2008, Bush set the deadline for implementing his co-existing Palestinian and Israeli “two-state vision.”
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had obtained a commitment in this sense from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the origin of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, which proposes to Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, particularly because it tackles the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," Prince Saud said in an interview with the Saudi Arabian capital daily.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always in this type of fact various, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the General Inspectorate of the National Police (IGPN), a police car was driving on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., rue Louise-Michel, in Villiers-le-Bel.
“She was not in intervention but on patrol, and was driving at 40-50 km/h, without a gyroscope,” a police source said.
A green motorcycle of the Kawazaki brand, “not approved, therefore not allowed to drive on the public road” (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, circulated “very fast”.
“She hit the police car on her left, after a priority refusal on the right,” a police officer said.
The control of alcohol levels on the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
The condition of the car (before crashed, starry windshield, bumper torn) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very soon, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thér<0xC3><0xA8>re de Givry, announced that she has entrusted an investigation for "facts of involuntary murder and non-assistance to persons in danger" to the IGPN, in contact with the departmental department of public safety of the Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor said that the IGPN investigation at this stage excluded the police from responsibility.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, heard on Sunday night, confirmed "the version of the policemen, namely that this mini-moto arrived relatively quickly on their left".
Yesterday, a sort of groove, probably caused by the rubbing of the footstools on the ground, showed that the two vehicles remained tangled as long as the police car manages to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after that?
Yesterday, a rumor circulated quickly in Villiers-le-Bel, that the police would have left the place very quickly, thus not lending help to the two young people.
The IGP, while remaining cautious, would also rule out “any serious wrongdoing” on this point.
"This is a more difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigations, on which one has to be very careful," a police source said.
Libération met an eyewitness of the few moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows overlooking the stage.
“We immediately went down, with my cousin who is a nurse at the hospital, to try to revive them,” said the witness.
There was nothing to do.”
He then saw “a policeman completely hagard, who was barking.
Two others were trying to resuscitate one of the young people, the fourth was talking on the phone.”
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and apparently the certainty that people were present from the unexpected situation of the youth, the police officers were taken by car by colleagues who arrived on the scene.
According to the witness, the rescue arrived "about twenty minutes after the departure of the police".
They also practiced heart massages in vain.
“I will not say that the police services did not provide assistance to the youth.
These young people were rescued.
The firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything was done to try to save them,” the prosecutor said.
Tension Rises in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday cracked down on the first demonstrations since General Musharraf imposed the state of emergency two days earlier.
In the eastern city of Lahore, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against the state of emergency were injured by tear grenades used by law enforcement, according to witnesses.
The latter responded by throwing stones, injuring police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been arrested.
Scenarios similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, or police officers charged and injured lawyers.
Many would have been arrested.
In Islamabad, lawyers from the Supreme Court bar called for a general strike and announced protests following a wave of some 500 arrests over the weekend by opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning to prevent the rally.
Other demonstrations were reported to have taken place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (north-west).
The lawyers’ movement on Monday garnered support from the religious parties grouped in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president “urged the people to send flowers to the judges who spoke out against the state of emergency and debris to those who took the oath before Musharraf.”
"Musharraf's promise no longer holds."
The Pakistani Supreme Court is directly concerned by the emergency measure promulgated Saturday night.
It was expected in the coming days to decide on the legality of the re-election to the presidential election, on October 6, by indirect vote of President Musharraf.
The president of the court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was ousted and replaced.
“Everything we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court’s rulings,” the magistrate told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army and become a civilian president "no longer holds" after the state of emergency was imposed, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to give up his military uniform by November 15, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government has denied persistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf has been assigned to residence by his deputy army chief.
More than one-third of pregnancies remain unforeseen
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as ill-planned or unplanned births.
Even today, more than one in three (36%) pregnancies are not expected, reveals a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as ill-planned or unplanned births.
Different methods of contraception such as the pill or the sterile still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, Ined estimates.
The liberalization of contraception has nevertheless allowed for better “fertility control,” according to the institute, which notes that the rate of pill use among women aged 20 to 44 has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
Even calculated in the near month for a couple out of five and if possible in the spring, season considered the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It will have taken astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates from the International Space Station (ISS) more than seven hours of work in space to perform the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel, indispensable for the continuation of the station's scientific activities.
A risky exit that has accumulated records due to its duration, its distance from habitable modules, the speed with which it was imagined, tools “do-it-yourself” by astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem arose on Tuesday as the astronauts unloaded the Harmony module from the Discovery shuttle, a large cylindrical piece charged with soon hosting the European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a kind of docking station for lab modules.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move a 17.5-ton solar panel power generation module, already present on the ISS, to position it at its final position.
After moving it, the crew began the redeployment of the solar panels of the module that have a span of 76 meters.
And that's where one of the panels, which unfold like accordions, was damaged over nearly a meter by a cable that got stuck.
The deployment was stopped to prevent further damage to the panel.
The astronauts, who originally had to perform a control exit of the Discovery shuttle, then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go snailing at the end of the 30 meters long remote control arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to perform the repair.
It is one of the best “spacewalkers” of NASA.
Large, durable, very agile, it has a very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training doctor was charged with “operating” the “injured” solar panel.
After precisely inspecting the damage, he severed the faulty cable and installed some sort of “buckles” on the damaged area.
He was assisted by a second "spacewalker" who remained near the ship and, from the inside, by other astronauts including Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini hockey stick wrapped in insulator to avoid electrocution on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and “do-it-yourself” by the astronauts aboard the station.
After the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before making an inventory of his tools and returning to the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed a half-day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts return to the Discovery shuttle for a return to Earth scheduled for Wednesday.
EADS Securities Sanctioned on the Stock Exchange
EADS stock is currently down sharply on the Paris stock exchange, after the aeronautics and defense group announced that it would have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to cope with the delays of the A400M.
EADS loses 4% at 21.96 euros currently on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to revise its 2007 operating result forecast following delays caused by the slow progress of the A400M engine development, which conditioned the aircraft's inaugural flight.
The cost to offset the delay in the delivery of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, is "between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than 1 billion for Airbus," the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS announced.
Due to these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new operating profit targets (EBIT) for 2007 when it presents its quarterly results next Thursday, he added, without further details.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
As a reminder, EADS' operating profit fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to costs related to the delays of another program, the very large carrier A380.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
Choosing the status quo
There will be no suspense on Sunday at the polls: the Russians will opt massively for the party of President Putin, united Russia.
Confirming their aspiration to stability, or even authoritarianism, after a very locked campaign.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin sent a televised message to the voters on public channels, already recorded but the contents of which are kept secret.
He does so as the leader of the united Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is expected to be overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president left nothing to show by receiving foreign ambassadors, contenting himself to deliver a new charge against the West accused of interference - his favorite theme during the campaign.
“We know the price of true democracy and we want fair, transparent and open elections, free elections,” he said.
In the eyes of the opposition, we are far from the point of view.
She denounces a campaign tainted with pressure.
Communist leader Gennadi Ziuganov said there had "never been such dirty elections, even in Yeltsin's time."
After the crackdown on protests last weekend, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegally protesting, remains banned from visiting, according to his lawyer.
“The Russians have kept the homo sovieticus mentality”
Behind these suspenseful legislations are two much more open questions:
Who will succeed Putin in the presidency?
The official newspaper published the date of the first round of the presidential election on March 2, 2008; candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Voted in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for a third consecutive term.
But no successors emerge.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful united Russia party who would choose the government and the president?
In any case, both in the legislature and in the presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
“The Russians have kept the homo sovieticus mentality, they do not feel master of their destiny,” says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov, from St. Petersburg State University, goes back further: civil society in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, “Putin has reinstated the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population, especially since this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by a certain economic ease,” says Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians “willingly renounce personal responsibility” that they had briefly demonstrated after the breakup of the USSR.
“What’s good to think about?”
The phenomenon affects all social strata, including the business world.
And the administrative elite wants to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of united Russia.
New freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The public prefers stability.
In the name of which the Russians will not vote for extremists either.
Conclusion of Tamara Cherednitchenko, 54-year-old teacher: “What good to think about?
Those who are in power are not too bad, why change them?
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of secrecy, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which trace the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are in open access.
The 47 million archival documents, stored on 27 km of linear in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were so far only consultable for a "humanitarian" purpose, that is, individually and nominally, at the request of a former victim or her rightholders.
The 11 states in charge of their management - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them up to researchers and historians.
The process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed and the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
Historians’ access to Bad Arolsen will allow research “in particular on the movements of prisoners, the population of the camps and the state of health of forced labour,” said Reto Meistern, director of the archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, objected to the public disclosure of these name documents, because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
Like the supposed homosexuality or mental disability of some deportation victims.
The records of the concentration camps or arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been collected after the war for a practical purpose: to find the deported or forced labour civilians and, if necessary, to provide them with proof of their internment, in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees handle tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for some of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
“There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents,” said Prof. Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for Research on Antisemitism at the Technische Universität Berlin in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, Indo-European bilateral trade already reaches almost 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is India's largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
EU Foreign Ministers gave their green light to the European Commission last April to enter into negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).Indo-European bilateral trade has already reached nearly 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is India's largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
LUE is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the EU’s 9th trading partner, according to European Commission figures.
“A free trade pact greatly undermines both economies” and “India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans,” said Peter Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, said the European commissioner Manopas. The first European and European giants traded annually for "47 billion euros of goods" and for "ten billion euros of services", said this week Dani<0xC3><0xA8>le Smadja, the head of the delegation of the European Commission in New

The Bank of England acknowledges concerns by offering <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion over five weeks
The Bank of England said on Thursday it was concerned about easing the current return of concerns about credit conditions, and announced an offer of <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion at the base rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an offer of unusual duration.
"In order to alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty about how they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its expected reserve supply during the maintenance period starting on December 5 in the form of a market-op-a-week."
The bank specifies that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put on the market on December 6 at 12:15 GMT, at the base rate and until January 10.
This is the first time it seems that the BoE puts on the liquidity market at five weeks in an open market operation.
These are normally done within a week.
The BoE added in its statement that it "stands ready to take further measures to maintain the rates" of day-to-day interbank loans in line with its base rate.
The day-to-day interbank rate was 5.829 percent on Wednesday.
The three-month rate stood at 6.6%, the highest since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the amounts put on the market by the Bank of England were accompanied by a significant penalty rate that had discouraged banks from using them.
According to some rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the exchange rate of the pound against the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the amounts put on the market by the European Central Bank, at more favorable rates and with a more assured discretion.
UMP and NC Refuse to Review PS Propositions on Purchasing Power
The UMP and Nouveau Centre groups on Thursday refused to discuss the articles of the proposed socialist law on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
Inscribed in a socialist "niche" (session at the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text contained a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the national PS office, including the 50% increase in the premium for employment, the restoration of the floating TIPP, a transport check or the framing of rents.
After UMP and NC voted against the review of the articles (180 votes to 115), the meeting was adjourned at the end of the general discussion which resulted in an exchange, sometimes lively, between the majority and opposition a few hours after Nicolas Sarkozy's televised intervention on purchasing power.
PS leader Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent all of its proposals in the form of amendments to the amending finance bill considered by the Assembly next week.
A new festival is born
Following numerous rumors about C3 Presents creating a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with British producer Melvin Benn's Festival Republic.
“For our company, it’s an honor to work with a person who has, no more and no less, inspired the current festival movement in America,” said Charlie Jones of C3.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer camping destination.
The festival is scheduled to take place from August 8 to 10 on a private 500-acre farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, Festival Republic director Melvin Benn is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the helm of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which annually attracts some 80,000 people.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio and in 2006, Festival Republic created the Henham Park Latitude Festival in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Calling Glastonbury the “most inspiring event” he has ever attended, C3’s Charlie Jones says his company and Melvin Benn’s are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
“We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and worked diligently with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia,” says Charlie Jones.
“We were in talks with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about this project.
“Unfortunately, we have become entangled in politics because of the current administration,” continues Charlie Jones.
“Fortunately, we were able to talk to Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a great festival on an exceptional site that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Chicago's Grant Park, after excelling in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The two events generated gross revenues of $9.8 million and $11.3 million respectively in 2007.
These two festivals are held in an urban setting.
“Melvin Benn’s European model is a rural festival, while ours are rather held in urban green spaces,” says Charlie Jones.
The goal is to merge, in one way or another, the two formulas to give both a European and an American impression of a rural festival.”
Vineland is roughly halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the holding of this event,” said Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but says "they are interesting enough to allow to invest in such an event and host a festival that, hopefully, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the host capacity of this festival is “very large,” like that of the 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He said invitations had been sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed at the time of press release.
“Vineland will be rock-like, but the music will be varied, in the hope of attracting all kinds of spectators,” says Charlie Jones.
His C3 partners, who received the Top Independent Promoter award from the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces the Terminator
It’s not easy to attract Hollywood movie theaters to Montreal when no one but Terminator opposes it.
This seduction mission is part of the function of delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger denounces the "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to play in the paws of the “Governator”?
“You have to be careful, it’s the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer the ones they will judge the best,” he said.
The race to the festivals
For now, however, the priority of Denis Turcotte is the promotion of cinema from here.
The Oscars race has begun.
Of all the festivals on the West Side, whether Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be a question of presenting the Quebec films, highlighting them and ensuring that the directors do interviews.
The Age of Darkness had a beautiful showcase at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on display in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally on the stock market? The experts divided by the sub-prime crisis.
Less than five weeks before the close of the fiscal year, investors are already rubbing their hands in anticipation of the arrival of the traditional end-of-year rally.
However, this year the experts are not so sure that this will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the December stock market generally has a positive behavior.
However, it is not appropriate to make forecasts solely based on statistics, since given the current context, uncertainties are watching the markets, at least in the short term. "
Although they are not in favour of the stock market gaining momentum during the last weeks of the year, these experts note that "the stock market is fed by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest due to the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of long-term leakage to quality values as well".
For this, they believe that the stock market will have a rather lateral behavior, not free of volatility "especially because we do not know the impact of the likely fall in Fed rates, given the high level of crude and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions"
Javier Barrio, BPI’s sales manager in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say that there will be a rally.
“That’s not the best thing,” the expert says.
The Ibex, the Spanish stock index, has lost nearly 4% since November 8, when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year at 16,000 points thanks to the reorganization of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year during these dates.
However, the expert nuances that things will be a little different this year as he believes the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the Constitution Day bridge (December 6th).
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, analyst at Inversis Banco, assesses that we are close to technical levels and "that's why we could observe an index swing that could be triggered based on the information that comes from the European Union regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst hopes that these will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for driving the Ibex towards new maximum ratings.
Solana, of Intermoney, says that "this year the big values are back for him."
The expert would include in the portfolio the two major banks and some manufacturers "because when the date approaches, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco said the increase will be due to the bank and the industrial sector.
Builders will also be able to benefit from this rally, in case they get into it.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other builders like Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path," the expert explains.
Cyclical consumption will play a key role in the final part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology companies will do just as well, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
For the past seven years, December has been a bearish month on only two occasions.
The authentic end-of-year rally took place in 2003, during which the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the drilling of the technology bubble.
This year, during which the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, the month of December saw an increase of 6.68%.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of earnings (for the time being the Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and if it succeeds in computer on its end-of-year rally.
The People’s Bank will open 200 offices open 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
The People’s Bank has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
A total of 200 banks are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a big change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish organizations, since it is the first group that has decided to start betting on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 8:30 pm, and to open on Saturday from 10 am to 8:30 pm.
Another group that has also reiterated several times that it would like to amplify the schedules of its branches, BBVA, although it has not yet decided to take the first step.
He is about to reach an agreement with the unions to close 75% of his agencies on Saturday instead of opening an afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the People's Bank's experience will be decisive for other organizations to join or not to join this initiative that coincides with business schedules.
This is precisely what the People's Bank is looking for.
Attracting autonomous customers who travel to these areas to make their purchases in SMEs and shops on the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 branches located throughout Spain in about 18 months, since it is not the opening of new branches but a renovation of those already existing.
To do this, the organization will modernize the branches that it already has in the commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of the customers of the different streets.
In this way, the amplification of the schedules is accompanied by a different design of the interior of the branch and a new design, more current, with brighter colors.
The bank’s commercial manager, <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera, says this renovation does not involve large investments, but the hiring of staff, since the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
The agencies, which will also have space for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
The Popular Bank has already tested its initiative in three agencies in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, as <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivero explains.
The branches of Murillo Brave, O'Donnell and Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a de Madrid are the streets that have been chosen, and apparently successfully, according to Rivero.
The Popular Bank currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others that operate under the brand of Mundocredit, specializing in the case of immigrants, also with very wide schedules, which open even on Sundays and holidays.
In these agencies of PopularMax they will not copy the model of the BBVA, where many of its agencies have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
“We don’t want to compete with our customers,” Rivero said.
For now, they have reached an agreement with Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica to sell mobile phones, with staff outside the bank.
Telecinco doubles its rival Antena 3’s market value for the first time
We've made it.
With this phrase, Paolo Vasile, a Telecinco CEO, expressed his satisfaction yesterday, at the closing of the stock market, when he found that the chain he runs doubled the value of its rival, Antena 3.
A single aspect tarnished his joy: 'What hurts me is not the fact that we increased more but that we decreased less,' he said.
However, he emphasized that in a weak market, 'we fell less'.
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
The gain stabilised its loss to 15.66 percent over the past year.
The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento (13% more) thus reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to data from Bloomberg.
Its rival Antena 3, which fell 1.52% yesterday and has accumulated a 40.5% drop since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of other publicly traded communications companies amounted to 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million in the case of Prisa (the publisher of Cinco D<0xC3><0xAD>as) and 1,779 million in the case of Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenne 3 is due to the fact that ' we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact represents what we are able to do, in the same market, at what price and how we make it profitable in terms of audience.
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become the first TV channel this year to exceed 1,000 million gross advertising revenues, as assured by Giuseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespa<0xC3><0xB1>a, the subsidiary that manages the group's advertising.
For this to be true, the TV channel is expected to see a 3.6% increase in its advertising billing for the current fiscal year, compared with 965.4 million in 2006.
For its part, the net billing of Antenna 3 increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (up to 734.4 million) while net television revenues increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point out for the best relative evolution of Telecinco on the stock exchange is the important pay out it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile says that although it is early to make a decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
" We have an official commitment to give a minimum of 50 per cent, although we have always stated much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to make our shareholders happy, to those to whom we have already given shares with the 33% of Endemol.
According to analysts, the market is showing signs of fatigue at the moment.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its estimates of profits on Telecinco in 2008 to 4% and in 2009 to 7%.
This is due to the decline in projected income growth from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company lowered the forecast for Antenna 3 gains to 4.5% in 2008 and to 7.5% in 2009.

The company Ibersecurities recommends buying both securities based mainly on its high dividend yield and its long-term sustainable potential.

JPMorgan: it recommends examining both cases since it had 'similar threats' (saturated market and poor economic climate).
Congress approves the transposition of Mifid, which came into force on November 1
Alongside its parliamentary formality, which ended today with the vote of the Congress on the amendments incorporated into the draft in the Senate, the Government submitted to a public hearing the regulations that will develop the new law, with the objective of its entry into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by Members of Parliament and Senators to negotiate and agree on the best possible regulation to ensure investor protection and to regulate in detail the activities of the agencies so that the markets function effectively.
MIFID, which amends the Securities Markets Act, involves the modernisation of financial markets, as it strengthens investor protection, enhances the powers of the leaders of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the different leaders of the European Union.
The new regulation will provide financial advisory services for specialized social reasons as well as for natural or legal persons and will create a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial advisory companies (FIAs), which merge with securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it increases the number of systems for the execution of transactions on financial instruments, so that it is possible to add to regulated secondary markets multilateral trading systems and order internationalization systems, which face competition from current exchange managers.
The Act also requires investment services companies to disclose information on key aspects of their business profile, exposure to risk and forms of risk management on the market, and it requires them to keep a record of all transactions they carry out, to facilitate control by CNMV.
Passing through the Congressional Economics Commission, several amendments have been added, one of which highlights that the securitized debts will be considered a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which has been demonstrated with what happened to the US high-risk mortgage debt (subprime).
In addition, they took advantage of the management's transposition benefited to legally delimit the functions that graduates in Economics can have 30 years after in 1977, was approved, the Royal Decree which delimits the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work on behalf of a company, who will not require the authorization of the CNMV and who will be able to lend its services of marketing products and attracting new customers to different investment companies at the same time.
Harmonised consumer price index rises by five-tenths in November to 4.1%
This indicator, which is then used by Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides an overview of price developments in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policies of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) by providing data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same method as that used for the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is indicative only, because it does not necessarily have to coincide with the final data to be released on 14 December next.
"CPI will continue at relatively high levels"
Second Vice President and Minister of Economy Pedro Solbes said that the 4.1% increase in CPI in November is a "time figure", but at the same time he predicted that the price index will continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes clarified in the hallways of Congress that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential on monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the government was not facing such a high increase.
"We were hoping for a figure of around 4%," the economy minister acknowledged in relation to the figure announced today.
Virgin plans to recover <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>42 billion over three years with Northern Rock
Northern Rock’s deposits have fallen by more than 50% to <0xC2><0xA3>12,000 million (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16,800 million) since it entered crisis around mid-September and had to resort to an emergency credit from the Bank of England.
At that time, it was amassing some record deposits above <0xC2><0xA3>25,000 million, a figure that gradually fell in two and a half months due to the mistrust of its customers and despite the 100% guarantee of this money that the Government has offered and that it will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rename the organization with its financial brand Virgin Money, needs to seize around a quarter of the revenues from British banks that will be deposited in the next three years to get those remaining <0xC2><0xA3>18,000 million to reach the <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 million target.
The tycoon group Richard Branson, known for its vociferous advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock this week named the offer from Virgin's association, which includes three other companies, including its favorite to save him from bankruptcy.
The mayor of Totana was arrested for an alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard arrested the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (from the Popular Party) this morning because of his alleged relationship with the plot of urban corruption discovered this week.
In addition, one of the city council secretaries and the municipal police chief were also arrested.
José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo replaced last May's self, Juan Morales, current right-wing MP, and until then municipal councilor of the town hall, and who, according to the sources of the investigation consulted by the SER Channel, could be the 'minor' of this plot.
The officers continue to search the municipal premises and those of the City Council and the possibility of further arrests in the next few hours is not ruled out.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the urban corruption plot, discovered earlier this week, has been charged.
As indicated yesterday by the SER channel to the lawyer of the MP 'from the People's Party' Juan Morales, he was arrested when leaving the home of Morales with important documentation in his possession related to the plot.
In addition, according to sources of the investigation, the object of the investigation is the alleged collection of commissions from Morales in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a construction company in Galicia to requalify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight people in detention.
Bono agrees to lead the Spanish Socialist Party’s candidacy for Toledo and to preside over Congress if they win elections
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero, to be at the top of the list of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo for the upcoming general elections and to be president of the Congress in case the Socialists win the general elections.
So the organizing secretary of the Spanish Socialist Party, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced this during a press conference after the meeting that took place this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The head of the executive justified the offer made to the former minister because "it is important to count on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he stressed that "yes it seems" that the politician from the Channel will be the candidate of the socialist group that will preside over the Congress if the socialists win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n as President of the Congress, who on November 15 made public his decision not to run for the next general election and to abandon his political career to devote himself to the fight against climate change in the academic framework.
The former minister acknowledged that the Prime Minister has not stopped insisting that he return to the political avant-garde since he abandoned it two years ago.
In addition, he noted that although citizens already know who will be the economic vice-president if the Spanish socialist party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce who will preside over the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he reaches the position, Bono hopes to turn the House into "a house of respect and not of insult or shouting" and make it "more and more like citizens".
"Sometimes it seems unfortunate that the only place in Madrid where you can't talk quietly and calmly is Congress, the President of the Government in the Senate on some occasions has been interrupted 26 times."
In the same way, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n and "his know-how" and he did not want to pretend he was already occupying his position so as not to fall, as he noted, into what his opponents might consider "a domination".
Climate Propaganda
Given that the climate change movement is subject to a merciless persecution of both the skeptics of its predictions and those who give priority to other political and social battles, it must demonstrate iron coherence.
This is especially the case for a leader of the movement who is president of the government like Zapatero and who believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and who even proposes to sign a "new contract for the planet".
This approach obliges him to explain why the action, or inaction, of his Government has made a decisive contribution to Spain's leadership of the European Union in the non-implementation of the Kyoto Protocols.
Who is responsible for the non-execution, in what sectors it occurred and why his Government, the one in the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, he must clearly explain to the Spaniards what measures he will take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what habits of citizens will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be forced to make, what economic consequences will this have?
That is, who will sacrifice himself and who will pay to save the planet.
But there was and there will be no explanation.
This is because it is about sacrificing and paying.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and individuals.
Up to one-hundredth of the essence suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party seemed to him readingly so dangerous to Zapatero that he hastened to deny it.
That is, it is about saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with slogans empty of any real consequence.
With phrases that have impact, commissions, committees, protocols, new positions.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for election campaigns who does not speak, who does not denounce and who does not demand, embellishes the meetings and inspires tenderness.
Provided that this is limited only to being a purely virtual contracting party and does not claim that we are moving by bicycle or refreshing ourselves with the fan.
Mayor and Totana Local Police Chief Arrested for Alleged Urban Corruption
The Spanish gendarmerie has arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the town hall and a hotel entrepreneur suspected of possible urban crimes, the sources of the investigation said today.
The municipal councillor was arrested at his home and was taken to the town hall, where at this time many officers met, who also presented themselves to the function of municipal councillor of urban planning and to the municipal enterprise of management of industrial land and housing.
These three arrests are in addition to the six arrests made last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land to urbanize them so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 homes, after paying illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested but are charged in the judicial investigation, which the Totana No. 1 Tribunal investigates.
The first six detainees have now moved to a court order.
According to the sources, Totana's former municipal councilor and currently a self-governing MP from the PP party, Juan Morales, is targeted by the investigation.
In addition, the ex-wife, owner of a real estate agency currently registered in Totana, was charged, as well as the current fiancée of the former municipal councillor, who resides in Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and entrepreneur of Vigo (Galice) Manuel N.A., were arrested in Nigr<0xC3><0xA1>n (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, agency of the Nuaria Group, and through which the bribes were allegedly made.
The investigation is carried out by the Group of Urban Offences of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the gendarmerie whose agents, in addition to arrests, carried out eleven inspections, the majority in companies related to detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Toda.
So only one person was arrested in Totana, in short, the owner of a well-known poultry business in the region, which may have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 housing units, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company has acquired in Totana 2.2 million square meters of land that have been requalified and its project would involve doubling the population of the municipality, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which deal with the real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the car parks of Vigo in the streets of Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, Venezuela and Fernando el Cat<0xC3><0xB3>lico square; Hogartel, which deals with the direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation.

A colleague passes information on the introduction of offences on Internet downloads into the Penal Code:
A. The downloading of a song would be a crime punishable by a penalty of six months to one year.
On the other hand, the theft in a CD store for a value of less than 400 euros, is considered only as a fault (Article 623.1).
B. Theft in a store for a value of up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,000 is already considered an offence, but the penalty is lower than that imposed for the download (Article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is lower than that imposed for downloading (Article 244.1).
D. Participating in a fight is less serious than participating in compact disc traffic.
Participating in a tumultuous brawl entails a three-month to one-year sentence (Article 154 of the Penal Code) and the trafficking of CDs would entail a six-month to two-year sentence
(Article 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film, according to section 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. The distribution of copyrighted and unauthorized films is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (Section 186).
Finally, if my colleague is in the real then someone exaggerates.

My attending physician told me of one of his articles on strange research titled: ‘Money produces brain activations, especially if others get less’.
That is, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of workers depend on what colleagues earn.
The study was conducted using tomographic magnetic resonance imaging at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the neurocognition imaging group at the Life&Brain Institute, Germany: “The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed.”
The researchers observed that when the two people guessed that they were receiving the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one of them received double the activation was greater.
I don't know if this conclusion required so much science.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly prosecuting war criminals in the Balkans for eight years since the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, which is located in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla will leave with a bitter taste, because the main culprits of the Srebrenica murder - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died -, former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are on this list whose documentary by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach takes its title, 'The Carla List' (2006, not projected exclusively in Spain), with the rhythm of a police thriller, which follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York who prosecutes the fleeing criminals and presses for the governments involved.
What insurance is appropriate for me?
Automobile insurance, which covers the driver in the face of possible accidents, involves a significant expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, the seniority of the driver's license, the marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use made of it, among others.
Having a car is the main thing.
Choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
And it is that, choosing the right car insurance, is even more difficult than choosing the model of the vehicle.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise is embodied in an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the premium granted and in return it becomes liable for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a claim.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, the seniority of the driver's license, the marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use made of it, among others.
Insurance companies determine their prices based on statistics, so that the higher the probability of an accident, the higher the rating to be paid.
This is why people over the age of 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, since statistics show that these people have a lower casualty rate than their caution.
Similarly, using censuses, the companies concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency, and therefore the likelihood of an accident.
By increasing the frequency, the odds increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when determining the premium price.
This is why the driver must carefully study the situation in order to choose the car insurance that best suits his profile.
Here we will expose the most significant variables when choosing one or the other type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, offers him a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 face a variety of disadvantages when entering into an insurance contract at an affordable price, such as low driving experience and seniority of the driver's license.
Although the ideal to be well-insured is an all-risk insurance, other more economical options exist.
The most forward-thinking drivers can opt for any risk insurance with deductible, so that they get insurance coverage at any risk but at a more affordable price.
This form of agreement implies that the customer pays a part of the amount of the claim.
"The portion of the amount of the claim that the customer pays will be determined based on the value of the premium, which will be higher the amount will be low," Luis Noguera, the head in Spain of First Europa, an online insurance broker, specifies.
Another option is extended third party insurance, so that the customer provides protection to deal with damage caused to third parties, but by those caused on his own car.
In addition, it would be covered against theft, fires and loss of the vehicle.
A piece of advice.
If you are under the age of 25, try to be careful and avoid claims as much as possible, as this will affect the bonus, which can reduce the price of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction in the basic rate that the company has.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase in the basic rate.
“The bonuses and sanctions will depend on the company and its profit.
If the company has had a good year it can afford to increase the bonuses," clarifies Noguera.
Beyond the age of 25, it becomes easier for drivers to enter into an insurance contract, as the rate of damages is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
It is for this reason that it is better to choose an all-risk insurance with deductible.
"Normally young people cannot benefit from the experience gained in advance after an accident," says the director of the European company in Spain and adds that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of driving, once the 'novice fear' has passed.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children, it is better that he negotiates insurance at all risk, as long as his economic situation allows it.
Marriages with children are considered by insurers to be the people with the lowest loss rate, because the increases will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be an all-risk insurance with deductible (may be 300 euros), or a third-party insurance extended from the third year of life of the vehicle when the insured has a high level of bonus.
“They have a more casual drive and they have a greater purchasing power to afford the luxury of assuming a larger amount of franchises,” said Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, an all-risk insurance with deductible is preferable (being the one of 150 euros), or an extended third-party insurance when the insurer has a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible accidents, but also because it represents a significant expense, it is for this reason that it is fundamental to properly study the insurance that suits us most according to our personal situation.
The Celtic will try to win a point in Milan to reach the eighth final
Milan AC and Celtic Glasgow meet next Tuesday in San Siro in search of the missing point to achieve their respective goals in closing the Champions League, as it serves the Italians to be first and the Scots to qualify.
The Italians have a total of ten points and they have already qualified in the fifth day thanks to a zero match in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but he still needs another point to make sure that Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six, and who receives Benfica who has four, does not pass him.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the sixth day ends, as AC Milan are due to play the semi-finals of the Club World Cup in Japan on 13 of this month in search of a place for the December 16 final.
Thus, this group will remain closed until the null match at the Giuseppe Meazza stadium seems to be the most expected result, although both teams will try to come out victorious, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic Glasgow knows that by winning it would remain first and ensure a better cross in the eighths of the final.
A defeat of Gordon Strachan's team might be enough to qualify if Shakhtar Donetsk doesn't win, but she won't be able to computer only on that since with nine points the game comes back to the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but who won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanese will try to poison the evening to the Scots, who have good hopes of qualifying for the eighth final for the second time in the Champions League, after being beaten during the last edition by a goal from Kaka during the prolongations (1-0).
Pending the victory of the 'rossoneri' the victory would only come back to Shakhtar, in case the Celtic would lose, to qualify for the eighth final to be able to continue the UEFA Champions League.
And it is that Benfica, although it is the last and with no possibility to continue the European competition, could reach the third place with a victory.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls kicked off their first tour in Vancouver, Canada, in front of about 20,000 spectators since the band disbanded in 2000.
' Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), ' Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), ' Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), ' Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and ' Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) said shortly before starting their concert at Vancouver's GM Place stadium that the group's meeting was "brilliant".
Around 20,000 people have used up tickets to attend the concert that was the subject of a video that tells the story of the band that raged in the late 1990s.
The meeting and the world tour coincide with the release of a new album that resumes their main hits as well as two new songs, ' Headlines' and ' Voodoo', which EMI releases in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls took to the stage showing the bracelets that Posh Spice’s husband, British footballer David Beckham, had offered them.
The athlete was in the crowd filling the GM Place, even though Victoria had banned him a few days earlier.
Before the show began, Victoria Beckham remarked that the British footballer "didn't see our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he's going to think of the show."
' Sporty Spice', who joined the group in 1998 "because of differences between us" and who caused the group to disband two years later, also expressed nervousness during an interview with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was afraid.
I was nervous but I saw that people's feelings changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls changed.
And I thought why not, I'm glad I made a decision," Chisholm said at the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "things have been sorted out and we enjoy ourselves a lot".
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girl last exhibited in 1998.
To begin with, according to CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
When they arrived at the airport, an army of baby sitters was waiting for them.
They have five or seven sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will perform in California (USA), San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
They will be on display in Madrid on December 23.
The new gas deal between Russia and Ukraine is a wake-up call.
A dispute over gas prices is brewing between Ukraine and Russia, increasing the risk of repercussions on fuel exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are conveyed by gas pipelines, and each pipeline is scrupulously monitored.
Kiev has announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, an altercation between the two had caused a decrease in supplies to EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, a Russian-owned monopoly company supplying gas, tried in vain to find an agreement on the cost of Russian gas supplied to Ukraine for the year 2008.
Gazprom said it would increase its prices to Ukraine as planned as it agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for the supply of gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts said this would result in a 40% increase in the cost of imports from Gazprom for Ukraine.
“It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the talks, reminding us that we are a country through which most of the gas passes,” Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinkh told Reuters.
“The fluctuations in gas costs would probably be linked to our discussions about transit taxes (to Western Europe) via Ukraine.”
The last major altercation between Moscow and Kiev caused in January 2006, the interruption of Gazprom supplies destined for Ukraine.
This led to a drop in exports to Western Europe, resulting in higher prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union’s supplies.
Russia has the largest gas reserves, although most of them are still underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom completes its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other nations of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health 'must control its foreign employees'.
The Scottish Ministry of Health needs to improve checks to be carried out on its extra-community employees to check if they have previous criminal records, the monitoring committee said.
The Auditor General's warning, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was implicated in the June attack at Glasgow Airport.
Mr. Black also expressed concern that the Scottish Ministry of Health does not have any specific data on the number of overseas people he employs.
However, his report highlighted other decisive controls, which were correctly carried out on a sample of employees of five health authorities.
The Auditor General carried out checks on extra-community personnel following the attack on Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Addullah, 28, an Iraqi-born doctor at the Royal Alexandra de Paisley Hospital, was arrested at the airport after crashing his jeep into the front doors of the main terminal.
He was one of three doctors who were filmed at the Old Bailey in October, suspected of being involved in various car bombing attempts in the UK.
The Ministry of Health will have to perform pre-employment checks on overseas personnel, to be sure of the validity of their qualifications, experiences, and work permits for the UK.
Although the Scottish Ministry of Health uses the Scottish Disclosure to carry out previous criminal checks, the agency has no right to obtain such information outside of the UK.
Among the many warnings, the Auditor General's report now states that committees are required to confront the Bureau of Past Penal Control, thus allowing employers to undertake controls over various countries.
“While we have found that some information about staff has been verified, this is not done every time,” the report said.
Mr. Black said that the Scottish Ministry of Health performs most of the pre-employment checks he would do himself, but he also added: "Our report highlights aspects where the system can be improved to ensure that adequate information about some overseas staff members is available to health services.
Peter Terry, president of BMA Scotland, said it was "extremely unlikely" that pre-employment controls could identify employees likely to commit future terrorist acts.
"The report suggests that the pre-employment checks currently carried out are working well in the Scottish health system and that it is not certain that these warnings can add some added value."
The Scottish health authorities have reported employing 1,161 people from overseas, most of whom are doctors and nurses.
But the Auditor General stressed that these figures certainly need to be revised upwards, partly because of problems in identifying staff with an indefinite contract, who might or might not choose to remain in our country.
The investigation has shown that the current procedures of health authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian, are quite adequate.
These checks are carried out on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Government of Scotland is currently revising its policy and system of pre-employment controls for overseas health personnel.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: “I was thrilled to be doing this work following the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport.”
She added that the Government of Scotland, allied with the Health Committees, would carefully consider the warnings set out in the report to be published next month, and would commit to ensuring better implementation of the recently updated pre-employment controls, valid for all employees, including overseas persons.
Joy Division dominates the Oscars.
Control, the biopic on Joy Division’s latest singer, Ian Curts, has won 5 awards, including the best film, at the Oscars for British Independent Film.
The trophies were also awarded to star Sam Riley, who worked in a store until he was hired as Curtis in this film directed by Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Madame Judi Dench was nominated for Best Actress for her role in the thriller "Notes on a Scandal"
Daniel Craig, the star Bond won the Variety Award for allowing the British film to be under international spotlight.
The awards were distributed during the ceremony at London's Round House.
Control chronicles Curtis' rise to success with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, aged 23.
The black-and-white film, whose soundtrack was directed by The Killers, David Bowie and New Order, was shot on a budget of just <0xC2><0xA3>3 million.
But the Dutch photographer, best known for his iconic cover of U2’s Joshua Tree, has won two awards, the first as best director and the second as best novice director.
Rock has also been awarded the Best Documentary Award for Julien Temple's film about Clash singer Joe Strummer.
The Best Actor award went to Viggo Mortensen for his portrayal of the driver of a Russian mafia boss in the London-based thriller directed by David Cronenberg, Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, known for his heroic character performances, won the Richard Harris Award for his outstanding contribution to the British film industry.
The 50-year-old director, having shot films such as Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the sequel to Indiana Jones, The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive this award named in honor of the star Harris, starring in Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
Richard Harris and Albert Finney have given people like me access to cinema,” he said.
“I’ve been lucky enough to meet Richard Harris twice.”
“I was admiring this great actor today, I was extremely honored.”
The Independent Film Oscars, better known as the “Bifas”, are awarded by a jury of directors, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa fans and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia Blocks 208 Terrifying Conspiracies
Saudi Arabia on Thursday revealed it has arrested 208 militants involved in organizing cells that are conducting an imminent attack on an oil site, as well as attacks against clerics and the armed forces.
State television of the world's largest oil exporter, said one of the cells of missile smugglers.
Al Qaeda supporters have staged a campaign against the allied monarchy in the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight activists, led by a foreign resident, was planning an attack on an oil site in the Eastern Province, the TV newspaper said.
Saudi Arabia quickly formed a group of 35,000 troops to protect the sites, following a failed attack by Al Qaeda in 2006, against the largest oil site in Abqaiq.
The newspaper, citing a statement by the interior minister, said 18 of the arrested people belonged to a cell headed by a “missile launch expert” who infiltrated the country.
It is said that the militants were planning the counter-band of eight missiles in the kingdom.
Twenty-two people among the detainees appear to have plotted to assassinate clergymen and armed forces.
The government has asked clerics to do more against Saudi-led Iraqis, to join Al Qaeda activists fighting against the Allied Forces and against the U.S.-allied Shiite Muslim government, considered heretical according to the hardline Sunny Saudis.
Al Qaeda activists believe that in Saudi Arabia, many ecclesiastics have collaborated with authorities to support the government-dominated royal family policy.
Activists, encouraged by calls against the pro-Western Saudi government by Osama Bin Laden, the leader of al-Qaeda of Saudi origin, targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy supply sites.
Significant efforts have been made by the armed forces over the past five ... months," the interior minister's spokesman said on state television.
Among the detainees are 16 members of the Medina organized in a “media cell” aimed at promoting “takfiri thought”, the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that supports the use of violence against infidel and apostate Muslims.
Among the detainees, 32 are accused of subsidizing the activists.
The climate of Venus could reveal the future of the Earth.
Scientists said yesterday that Venus was certainly a pleasant planet to live on.
Data from the European spacecraft in orbit showed that the planet is certainly twice as small as the Earth, contrary to what was previously thought.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
These two worlds are practically the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus may have had conditions similar to those of Earth, and may even have been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion due to solar radiation combined with slower rotation, led Venus to a whole other kind of evolution.
Today the planet is devoid of water, is ravaged by hurricanes and lightning storms, and has a surface temperature warm enough to melt lead.
The findings from Venus Express, the European Space Agency’s probe, which has been studying the planet for a year, offer a sad vision of the Earth’s potential future due to catastrophic climate changes.
Professor Fred Taylor of the University of Oxford’s Department of Physics, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: “We are beginning to understand why the climate of Venus is so different from that of Earth, although the planets themselves are practically similar.
“Our new data allows us to establish a scenario that billions of years ago, Venus would have been originally identical to Earth, maybe even with a habitable surface.”
Enriched uranium seized by the police.
A kilogram of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was seized by Czechoslovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police officer said three people were arrested and that the material is currently being analyzed.
He did not confirm that it was uranium, but revealed that the commodity would be worth $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).
Still open to everything
Mitt Romney said he was not up to the challenge of running for president to answer a snowman’s questions.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates have finally agreed to participate in the You Tube debate, during which many ordinary voters who have registered their questions submit them to the candidates.
Wednesday night, November 28, none of the questions posed was as ridiculous as the one from another You Tube debate, when a snowman asked Democrats their position on global warming.
But this time, the questions and answers reflected the conditions of the Republican Party, which is running for the next election.
It is not known on what criteria, the producers of CNN, which sponsored the debate, chose the clips of You Tube to show to the candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest on a single topic, focused on immigration.
The topic is one of the strong topics for Republicans.
CNN asked some voters to call when they would hear pleasant things: The board saw gains in approval when candidates spoke rudely.
The hardest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the national front, and Mr. Romney, who leads the major early elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was accommodating about illegal immigration during his tenure as mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of employing illegal immigrants at his home.
The two fighters became particularly ferocious when asked if they would be willing to promote “amnesia” (offering illegals regular status and the opportunity to become a citizen).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, have been able to delve deeper into this topic.
Neither of them has the opportunity to be elected, but both remain in the race, perhaps thanks to the fact that they started fighting immigration earlier and more incisively than the others.
In general, candidates, at least regarding immigration, have the same opinions: stricter borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This issue, coupled with concerns about toxic toys made in China in particular, or other fears about the outside world, encourage Republicans to forget, or minimize, the divisions between libertarians and Catholic conservatives.
But the debate became particularly embarrassing when other topics were raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the campaign for arms control.
John McCain and Romney debated whether putting water in the nose should be considered torture.
One of the speakers asked if the candidates believed in its entirety, the content of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to dare declare that the Bible is his favorite book, even though he is not sure to believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another speaker asked if Jesus would have been in favor of the death penalty.
One did not expect to see Mike Huckabee, - at the pole position in Iowa in a recent election, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - declare that the death penalty is painful although necessary.
When one insisted on whether Jesus would have been in favor, he laughed and said that Jesus is too chic to run for election.
The human race remains unusually open to everything.
Mr. Huckabee’s ascent to Iowa coincides with recent prodigious research into grants led by libertarian Ron Paul, and the whistles in Wednesday’s debate.
These two emerged out of nowhere, thanks to the fact that the two protégés of the party fail to agree to decide who is the best-known and most traditionalist candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate unified the party early and convincingly through a successful message about American greatness bringing the leaders closer together.
This time, the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The Pains of Labour
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole in which to sink; even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
Given the trend of British scandals, this one is not particularly juicy.
No decorations sold, no Parisian hotel bills from politicians, no extra conjugal finger sucked.
But a revelation attests that a wealthy businessman would have masked for four years, under false names, his contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to more than <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 ($1.3m), which the party would not have declared: A new battle that Gordon Brown would have fought well.
Two months ago, the prime minister backtracked on his election plan, foolishly insulting British intelligence by proclaiming that opinion polls did not influence his decision, and that he hoped, on the contrary, to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, such as Vince Cable, the brilliant Liberal Democratic leader, said that the terrifying Mr. Brown has transformed himself from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The acquisition of Northern Rock, a bank in difficulty on the edge of the crack, has demonstrated a breach of the guidelines and poor judgment in case of an emergency.
Inadequate proposals to change the tax code have provoked a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data by the tax authorities revealed an incredible administrative murmur.
A trio of retired generals launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting against cuts in military spending: they proclaimed that being minister of defense is for them, a part-time job.
At the moment, suspicion of sloppy donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Labour Secretary-General (and his former head of vigilance) have caused them to resign.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is inevitably heading towards the exit.
However, governments can come to a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People do not like politicians, and do not trust them, but generally leave their doubts aside when a new government comes to power.
It seems obvious that a prime minister cannot improve things, or even govern for a long time, when he risks suspension: the public administration is no longer working; the cabinets of ministers are taking stock; the press is looking for bad stories; and the government is becoming defensive and no longer objective.
In a sense, Mr. Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot boast of being a beginner.
Although he would like to repudiate Tony Blair, he was still his senior lieutenant.
Problems related to Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are related to Mr. Brown's decisions made when he was Chancellor of the British Treasury.
And even if he is not directly involved in Blair’s misfortunes, such as the long investigation into the party’s funds “money cash for members of the House of Lords,” voters might think otherwise.
But the difficult situation Mr Brown is facing is not so tragic as it seems.
The gaps are not as monstrous as the members of the Tories party make you think.
As in Mr. Bean, there are no victims or scammers.
And the remedy, although painful, could be to put into practice Mr. Brown’s usual Stalinist tendencies, in favor of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new political donation scandal is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very special character, who compares his donations to charity, said he did not want any public recognition of his charity.
He may have his opinion, but it is not up to him to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of politicians’ big donors are clear, and they exist for a good reason: The public has the right to know who contributes to the success of those who will rule the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he was aware of Mr. Abrahams' programs, without knowing that it was illegal, will therefore have to be questioned, as will Jon Mendlesohn, the fundraiser, who had spoken about the dubious donations in October.
But so far Mr. Brown is not involved: Nothing suggests that he was aware of these steps, even though most of the payments made were made following his arrival in the government in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has made half of it.
He quickly condemned his party's legislative flaw, but he did not draw attention to the fact that the decision-making power rests on something he knows well, resorting to an investigative committee on this subject consisting of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to be learned are not complicated.
And if the law has been violated, it is up to the police.
In addition, there are many other things that Mr. Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the Independent Committee on Public Life Standards, without a leader for six months, and preparing a good reform on the financial side of political parties.
This would force the Labour Party, at a time of weakness, to cooperate with the Tories, which could lead it to renounce its particular financial relationship with the confederations; in short, a bitter pill for a supporter like Mr. Brown.
But he should face some partisan facts.
The Conservative Party now has a good electoral advantage; it has two years to win back voters, and the only way to win is to demonstrate impeccable integrity and strong skills.
Card scams.
Would the Mortgage Crisis Contaminate the U.S. Credit Card Market?
When there is blood in the water, it is normal to see tickling fins swirling around.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is going through a critical phase, predators are targeting the U.S. credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts believe credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the contagion extends from mortgages to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in fees and insolvency rates, which measure unrecoverable or unrecoverable balance sheet shares more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken $1.4 billion in consumer credit, in part because of the weakness of cardholders.
It’s too early to panic.
Fees and insolvencies are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the insolvency rate of 3.89% in the third quarter is almost one point lower than its historical average.
The deterioration of rates is partly explained by technical factors.
A change in personal bankruptcy laws in the United States in 2005 caused a sharp drop in bankruptcy records, which in turn caused heavy losses for credit cards; the number of records (and therefore insolvency rates) could increase even if the borrowing conditions were to worsen.
The industry also announces fixed payment rates, which highlight the amount of monthly debt that consumers have to pay.
and the confidence in the capital security of credit cards is quite strong despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, predicted that the broadcast volume for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
The direct linkages of infection between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers might prefer to increase their debts now that fair real estate loans have disappeared.
But card issuers pay more attention to cash flow than to the value of wealth, and so the fall in real estate prices has not necessarily led to a change in borrowers’ credibility.
They could even bring benefits to issuers of credit securities.
Consumer premiums for mortgage payments fall if the properties cost less than the value of the loan; as a result, credit card debt would become a priority to repay the whole.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgages and with more flexibility to such crisis conditions, as they can change interest rates or alter credit limits.
This should, in theory, reduce the risk of a rapid resumption of actions.
“We’re not going to wake up one morning and re-evaluate all the loans,” said Gary Perlin, the director of Capital One.
If a financial disaster in the credit card market is unlikely, there is a high risk of a consequential downturn.
If lower real estate prices and a contraction in the credit market drive America into recession, the industry will certainly have to face a grim future.
Be careful with the dorsal fins.
British bankers plead guilty to the Enron case.
The three British bankers who were due to testify to their roles in relation to a fraud committed by Enron's former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, changed their statement, pleading guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had initially pleaded not guilty to the seven charges of alleged collusive fraud in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial scam to enrich themselves in spite of their employees.
They are expected to appear in court in January.
But during a hearing chaired by U.S. Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., they all pleaded guilty to fraud.
The three former Greenwich NatWest executives, a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland’s PLC group, have become famous across Britain because of extradition proceedings that lasted two years.
In the United States, their case remains a pending matter for this investigation launched following the fall of Enron in 2001.
The charges against them in 2002 made it clear to Fastow that he was the subject of the government's investigation into Enron's debacle.
The charges against the bankers, dubbed the “Natwest Three,” claim to have come to Houston in 2000, to organize a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his former right-hand man, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary of a partner of Enron controlled by Fastow, who was the director of many fraudulent scenarios, which helped him rig bankruptcy proceedings.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had considered its interest in the subsidiary to be null, but in fact the three British already know its value.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the interest from the subsidiary's bank for <0xC2><0xA3>1 million.
The bankers paid $250,000 to Kopper as interest for this company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely announced to Enron that the energy company was willing to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in truth those $20 million went into the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the accusations, bankers would have earned $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and the others would have earned $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to his active role in two conspiracies in Enron's debacle.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow endures a six-year prison sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is jailed for three years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three Britons were released following the payment of a bail of $1 million each, forcing them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, formerly the seventh-largest national company, bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting trickery, could no longer hide its billions in debt or even offer its sloppy speculations as profitable.
The collapse caused thousands of layoffs, more than $60 billion in market value loss and more than $2 billion in loss for retirement plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year of involvement in the collapse of the company.
Skilling was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
The charges against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes were futile because of his death from a heart attack last year.
No money, no money outside of Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and with sufficient fuel range to fly non-stop from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is only a small change for some Russians.
“It can carry up to 18 passengers,” said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
“Even if no one really needs as many seats as it is more of a family-run aircraft or for the president of a company.”
Mr. Firer was present at the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaires’ Salon, a four-day consumer incentive orgy held in a huge exhibition centre around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their stands, hoping to arouse the interest of the new rich Russians for their varied products, ranging from mahogany yachts to cars filled with diamonds such as those of 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer was scrutinizing a bright orange Porsche, displayed next to his booth.
“It’s a nice car, but nothing like our product,” he said.
“After the United States, Russia is the second largest private jet market.”
“Thanks to an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to be rolling in black gold, like Dallas.”
“We experienced the same thing in the 1890s, when some Americans became so rich and landed in Europe where they were considered materialists,” said Marshall Goldman, a senior scholar in the Davis Department of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudis in the 1970s, the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians emerge as the world’s largest spenders.
The biggest luxury brands are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, in another location in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on the strategy to be followed for the sale of luxury goods to markets such as Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which is owned by The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billionaires worth $282 billion, according to the Forbes list listing the richest people.
In addition, two-thirds of the rich are made up of 103,000 Russian millionaires who are worth a total of $670 billion, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, carried out by economists from the Center for Economic and Financial Research.
(The World Bank stated that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty line).
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, that’s why we’re all here,” said Nicole Marais, a representative of Davis Morris, a London jeweler.
She participated in the show for the first time in the company of the Russian distributor, Soho Jewellery Group.
“Women are all well prepared and men are worth a fortune.”
Walking in the salon, Sunday night, the two real estate agents bet on their 31, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, claim to be like their customers, millionaires.
“I was looking at the cars and trying to choose between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche,” said Ms Yumatova, who grabbed her haute couture dress like a veteran of the red carpet like Joan Rivers.
The show seems primarily aimed at the new rich, the kind of buyers of Russian brands willing to queue in the stoppers to come up to a huge warehouse where Cadillac Escalades, platinum bars, Mövenpick ice cream, custom pool tables, apartments in Dubai and our.
The public could buy the tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
“The Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and best brands,” said Mr. Gijrath, proudly sitting at the Royal Delf porcelain factory stand, in front of a handmade Raimbrant mural on blue tiles.
"It is certain that the Russians are more interested in bling bling"
Indeed, the sellers here said that Russians with old capital (10 to 15 years are too old by Russian standards) have already switched from bright logos to a kind of limited edition brand that could not be sold at the show.
Despite this, thousands of people, whether millionaires, emissaries of millionaires or tourists, walk the exhibition every day.
And some even buy.
During the first night of the exhibition last Thursday, Roman Ershow, the CEO of King Koil beds, said he sold two sets of silk, cashmere, and cotton mattresses inlaid with gold threads.
During the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the sales director of A1 motorcycle, a company that equips cars with state-of-the-art alarm systems, also said he had sold to a Russian millionaire, the bright orange Porsche, for $170,000.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that personalizes luxury cars, said he would sell three bracelet-like cars, for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, at $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter, the wheel of a car designed for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be inlaid with Swarovski crystals to make it look like a roulette wheel.
The set of four costs $22,000.
“The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of ostrich leather, or a picture of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive with such tires,” Karapetian said.
He will certainly keep it in his garage already containing 30 or 40 vehicles.”
Although many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Karapetian said the term “Russian millionaire” is not on the agenda, given the rise in real estate prices here.
“If you had bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash,” he said.
“There’s more than you might think.”
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel this emotion when they go to the booth of Alliance Continental, a Russian wealth management company.
The company has erected four stands representing British phone booths, filled with mass counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing director, said his team printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire show.
Passers-by arrested for throwing lots of tickets, asking their friends to photograph them on their mobile, right in the middle of this false wealth or pocketing a few million.
“You see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire,” Karyev said.
Unlicensed Surgeon Suspected of Homicide in New Jersey
It was on the eve of Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the window bay of the Just a little Healthier restaurant and watched an ambulance that had just stopped at the doors of the White Cape Cod on West Scott Avenue.
Then came the police patrol.
And then another one.
“Then I saw the medical vehicle stop,” Mr. Livingston, a restaurant manager, said Wednesday.
That’s when I realized that someone had died.
Authorities would then learn that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now investigators are trying to determine whether the cause of his death is due to a gesture performed by an unlicensed cosmetic surgeon, which the police have not yet identified, residing at 212 West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet determined the causes of Ms. Arroyo's death, but they are confidently waiting for the results of the toxicological tests which, unfortunately, will take time, but which should allow to solve this mysterious death that has saddened the high ranks of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo has been the assistant to the director of police, Garry F. Mc Carthy, since September 2006, and her voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious,” McCarthy said of Ms. Arroyo in a telephone interview Wednesday.
“She was like a pit bull.”
“She would have done anything to protect me.”
Mr. McCarthy said that Ms. Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she left two sons aged 14 and 11, as well as a daughter-in-law.
Eileen Walsj, spokesman for the Union County Attorney’s Office, Theodore J. Romankow, said detectives were trying to determine whether Ms. Arroyo died from an unauthorized surgery.
“This is an opportunity to consider.”
“The investigation continues.”
Authorities said they arrived at her house around 3 p.m.
and found Miss Arroyo on the couch.
She was declared dead.
A little over a week has passed since, and authorities have not said much about the investigation or even about the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh was unable to confirm whether Ms. Castro was interrogated by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to figure out if part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door of Ms. Castro's house where a faded rose tree rests in the narrow cemetery in front, and a Dalmatian barked at the back.
A blue can called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute for vanilla in the kitchen and for perfumes, lay in a hangar, next to a door leading to the underground.
Two bicycles all terrain hung on the sides.
McCarthy said that since she arrived in Newark 25 years ago at the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo has been extremely valuable, helping her navigate the new city and abandon her framed political culture.
“She said, ‘You have to be careful about this,’” he said.
“She was there when I arrived, and still there when I left.
“It was embarrassing.”
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will lower rates related to the swell of the global stock market.
Shares exploded on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped the Federal Reserve would have tried to calm credit conditions, subsequently lowering interest rates promoted by the soothing statements of the vice president of the U.S. central bank.
Stock markets are exploding in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, No. 2 after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, said those who decide must be “flexible and pragmatic” in their actions in the turbulent financial markets.
In an apparent effort to reassure irritable markets given these new credit-related tensions, Kohn said the recent turbulence has partly “reversed some improvements in the functioning of the market in late September and October.
Should this harsh turbulence persist, it would increase the chances of further tightening financial conditions for owners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as an obvious signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into U.S. markets, and that further interest rate cuts could stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also calmed Wall Street with even worse news about the U.S. economy, such as the biggest drop in real estate sales for the month of October.
The repercussions of this financial turmoil were heightened following the statement by investment bank Bear Stearns, announcing that it will lay off 650 people, i.e. 4% of its staff, to reduce costs to compensate for heavy losses due to losing real estate loans.
Only 20 jobs are planned in London where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average increased by 331 points, or 2.55%, to 13,289.40, while the largest index, the S&P 500, rose 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index took 165.5 points or 2.7%, concluding at 6306.2 adding more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 to the value of British companies.
The German Dax index increased by 2.6% and the French CAC40 rose 2.3%.
Previously, the recurrence of credit difficulties in the markets was highlighted by the strong demand for a monthly auction of sorted funds from the European Central Bank, which cut these loans to European commercial banks at a heavy rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England to follow the EDF and the ECB and to inject further funds into London's financial markets, causing credit tensions, has caused the monthly "Libor" loan rates of British banks to cause their highest growth since last September, at 6.59 percent following a sharp resurgence.
England faces a call for judgment against critics of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We are faced with two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be the No. 6 England drummer in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in such a broad context as the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the chairman of the selectors who was exceptionally there to help Peter Moores, head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, make his decision, and because the office of Hugh Morris, the chairman and CEO of England, is beginning to fill out the application forms to become a national selector, at least in time.
The one who will not be able to win the back n°6 will be unlucky, but life is often unfair and sport is also unfair.
It is never easy to annihilate what allows one man to reach the top of his profession while another will never reach beyond the lower level, sometimes out of lack of luck more than out of lack of skill.
It is not only in cricket that selection is difficult, because in the end, judgment remains subjective.
Is it the right time to bring out Bopara?
Is that fair to Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, which to choose between John Edwards or Banerjee "tubby"?; both, new executives having obtained good degrees, professional, should be promoted: but there is only room for one of them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a cricketer unless he is given at least one chance?
The numbers are important in decisions, but also opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricketer must capture the captain's eye, at the same time he must take the door and a drummer must be lucky to touch the one-day cricketer.
But capturing the eyes of the selectors is much more complicated.
Many did better last season, for example, James Anderson who seemed certain to play the first Test, even though Stephen Harrison declared himself in full shape and continued to train to serve.
Anderson took 32 first-class doors on 33 laps to win a place.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 at the same average, but both have already experienced their moment of glory at the highest level and are still hoping to offer.
If it is Shah or Bopara who will play at Asgiriya Stadium, it is only a matter of opinion.
This choice could annihilate or build a man’s career, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and did well in the first, with five doors and 40 useful laps, but it was Paul Collingwood, who also struggled to emerge, who managed to become the primordial cricketer of the Test, and this, despite the fact that his double hundred scored against Australia in Australia can still be
The probability predicts that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's session at Asgiriya Stadium, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and promote Shah's greatest experience against the exuberance of the young Bopara.
Both have good arguments.
In favour of Shah, his brilliant and considerable start to the innings of the 88 Test in Bombay, 32 cents first class against six for Bopara, who at 22 is seven years younger, and his excellent ranking at the launch.
But Shah only made ten laps in his two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Test at Lord, his Middlesex player town, and that, the immediate rejection by the selectors when Vaughan again in shape, claimed his place for the next game, seems to have afflicted his so obvious boosts in Bombay.
Unlike him, the Essex player is full of joy to live.
Nothing scares him on a cricket pitch and he exaggerated when he recently capsized on a 4x4 during a presentation of Volkswagen, sponsor of England.
He only reported minor injuries, was shocked, even though the first thing he did was take his Vodafone (sponsor of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who was watching him from a distance, to ask if “he had seen that?”
Bopara is by far the best drummer, his flamboyant pace allows him to do services that suit him, and that he beats with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Could this be the true art of selection?
I would be conducive to giving Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah should not apply if, as tea leaves suggest, he will be playing this weekend.
The buses bring people back to work, and to fight al Qaeda.
The first bus filled with Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, dumping those exiles without money or visa renewals, or others who hope the city has regained normalcy.
Some have returned to fight the militants who have driven them away from home.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival in Damascus of 800 people transported in the convoys of dozens of official government buses, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by their means.
“I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad,” said Sabah al-Kubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came home today because I saw on TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and saw that the city is safer now.”
“They say the Mahdi army no longer commits crimes!” he said, referring to the Shia militia of ecclesiastical militant Moqtada al-Sadr, who has forced his men to move away for the time being.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the Sunni-dominated Amariyah area, has returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime is preventing Iraqis from working.
His neighbors from Shia to Amariyah called him to inform him that the U.S.-aided militia had allowed Al Qaeda to drive out of the western capital, and invited him to return.
One of Jordan’s newcomers is the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his home north of Baghdad because of a grenade attack after he incited citizens to rebel against Al Qaeda.
But he had to come home to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had set up an anti-Al Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and that they needed me and my boys.”
“That’s why I’m coming home today,” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many say they have been drawn to the capital’s growing calm since U.S. troops arrived, and to the prospect of continuing formation of well-armed “involved citizen groups” collaborating with the U.S. military to defend their neighborhood.
But still others say they have been forced to return because of the visa problem and the decadence of the capital of Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, father of three, expressed the suspicion felt by all about the visas for exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, Shia Prime Minister, who allegedly asked the Syrian government to limit to force people to return to the country.
More than two and a half million people reportedly fled the country because of sectarian death squads.
“We didn’t have a problem until al-Maliki came to Syria and urged the government to stop giving visas to Iraqis, to force them back into Iraq,” he said.
“I can’t trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house when I left.”
The decrease in violence can be partly explained by the fact that the Sunnis were driven out of Shia areas and vice versa, creating places where tensions are less.
There is concern that a sudden influx of refugees will again increase sectarian tensions and bring back the fighting.
Small sarre, good training.
The smallest federated state leads in the field of vocational training, and even shines through the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in one area that a deficit weighs on the Sarrois, similar to that of the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non-Sarrois, that we are not French" - this is the slogan that the smallest federated state, by self-deception, posters for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the training system of the Saarland, which is placed fifth in the training monitor of the Cologne Institute of German Economics.
Thus, already traditionally, higher education institutions cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Saarbrücken in 1948 by the French.
To date, students have the opportunity to complete their studies with a double or even a triple degree.
This is evidenced by the high rate of 15.6 per cent of foreign students.
The Saar also leads the children of the country to higher education in greater numbers than average - many of them without a high school diploma.
"In Saarland, we take advantage of the vocational training system," says Axel Plünnecke, training expert at IW.
More than one in five young people obtain their degree in a vocational school, so the Saar is more than seven points above the national average.
The possibilities for combining vocational and academic training are also relatively well developed.
Given the number of inhabitants, the dual-degree panel is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
That is why the Ministry of Education of Sarroia has forced the higher schools to a marketing campaign in the engineering sciences subjects.
"After the first PISA studies, we celebrated a large number of reforms in general schools," said a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced comparative tests throughout the federated state.
For children to start learning earlier, the last year of kindergarten is out of law - a model that in the meantime other federated states copy as well.
Only future comparative studies will be able to show whether students' performance improves sustainably.
In the PISA studies in 2003, the proportion of students at risk decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
Overall, however, the Saarland has not improved as much as other federated states.
The Bavarians are doing better.
And despite the great sarrois, knowledge of foreign languages is not measured by PISA studies - one could otherwise earn points in this area.
Because the language of the neighbor is mandatory in high schools - even if the Sarrois are not French.
Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez sets the clocks
In Venezuela, watches will soon tick differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chavez will raise the timer to half an hour in the South American country.
In the meantime, Chavez has become a caricature in Spain.
As the official newspaper of Venezuela reported, due to a new law, the watches will be set to less than four and a half hours of universal time.
In this way, the South American country obtains a time zone that does not exist in any other state of the world.
The anti-American Chavez justified his position, among other things, by the fact that the United States would have imposed on the world the separation of time zones into full hours.
In addition, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez announced on Wednesday (local time) the termination of relations with the neighboring country, Colombia, due to a hostage affair.
The left-wing nationalist announced that as long as conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, he would have no relations with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
“I can’t, already just because of my dignity,” said Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, who is in a hurry for a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country will have to vote through a referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, it would significantly strengthen its power in the country.
The trigger of this dispute was Uribe's decision to withdraw from Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez the mandate to negotiate the release of hostages with the Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe allegedly "cracked Venezuela's face" with the decision, Chavez had criticized Sunday.
In Spain, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez is also in every mouth.
A new mobile phone ringtone is raging in the country: "Why don't you shut up" (why don't you shut up) is the phrase that more than half a million people have already downloaded on the internet.
It was pronounced by the king of Spain, Juan Carlos, who, at the most recent Ibero-American summit, was annoyed by the constant interpellations of left-wing populists and who told him to shut up.
A fall in wages threatens Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong economy, a real under-value of wages is forecast to threaten German workers this year.
Experts have cited all sorts of reasons to explain their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees are expected to see a real decrease in their payroll in 2007 compared to the previous year.
"The fault lies in the low wage development, the increase in the Value Added Tax and the rise in food and energy prices," Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research told the Bild newspaper.
There may also be new charges in the area of unemployment insurance for the employee.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the planned 3.3 per cent reduction in unemployment insurance for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to be embarrassed to ask the Federation for credits or financial aid, in the words of the SPD politician.
It was reported on Tuesday that the explosion in food and oil prices had pushed the inflation rate to its highest level in 13 years.
In total, prices increased by 3.0 percent from one year to the next.
Venus is the infernal twin of Earth.
Despite its hostile atmosphere to life, Venus looks more like Earth than previously thought: the European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and wind swirls at the poles, similar to those that appear on Earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have assumed that there are lightning strikes on Venus.
The European probe "Venus Express" today provided proof of this - it detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: lightning on Venus explodes at a height of about 56 kilometers of cloud in a cloud, reports Christopher Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific magazine "Natural.
According to the famous theory of cyprin, lightning would have brought life on Earth: the storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstone of life.
This is not the case on Venus: “If there was life, it must have been at a very ancient date in history,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
There should be hardly any living things on the surface of Venus today: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
“Venus may be the infernal twin of Earth, but it remains a twin,” Russell said.
Why Venus, which is so similar to Earth in mass and dimensions, has been struck by such a different evolution, is the fundamental question of the ASE mission.
The departure of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important milestone in Venus research, as no more probes have been on the way to explore this planet since the 1980s.
According to the researchers, the most recent research results that have now been presented in several "Nature" articles do not only highlight the singularity of Venus within the solar system.
They also show that the commonalities with Earth from our neighboring planet are more numerous than assumed at first.
Thus, the researchers found, in addition to the already known wind swirls at the North Pole, a swirl of clouds at the South Pole, which rotates even faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents in the terrestrial hemispheres in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica Italian.
The second planet in the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, almost as large.
The planet called the evening or morning star revolves around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it rotates much more slowly on itself: a Venusian day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, bears little resemblance to Earth, scientists assume that the two planets formed under similar conditions.
On both, water accumulated and remained on Earth in the form of oceans, but was lost in space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide has settled on Earth in the form of carbonate, it constitutes most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel’s meeting with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler calls for an end to the dispute between the parties over the reception of the Dalai Lama to the Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for the attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about the appearance of Germany and summons the grand coalition to close the dispute about the reception of the Dalai Lama.
“We must not present to the outside world a divided nation on this issue,” Köhler told the Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
“Human rights have universal validity, even if I have respect for differences between cultures,” Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany should maintain a sensitive foreign policy balance, the President of the Federal Republic stressed, but defended Merkel against the accusations that she would organize a new Chinese policy.
The German Chancellor has not distanced herself from the traditional policy of a single China.
“China knows that too,” Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed his dissatisfaction with the reception of the Dalai Lama and had been attacked for this outside the ranks of the CDU.
Steinmeier complained in particular about the CDU's "advantage policy" on foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Chancellery, virulent irritations were felt in the German-Chinese relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only dismissed German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to the Spiegel, also frozen the so-called strategy dialogue of the foreign ministers of the two countries.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao is now demanding German Chancellor Angela Merkel recognize that the Dalai Lama’s reception was a mistake.
China refuses to allow European politicians to receive the spiritual leader of Tibet in his official functions, Wen Jiabao said.
The Dalai Lama's words and actions would show that he is trying to separate Tibet from China and other Tibetan regions, which also includes other present-day provinces.
Schäuble warns against riots like those in France.
Street fighting with police, shootings, cars on fire: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots like those in France.
Everything must be done so that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not erupt in the streets by violence, the German interior minister demanded.
Burning barricades, gunmen firing on police with hunting rifles: after the serious youth riots in France, German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
We need to make sure that a social explosive does not also form in our own country and is disintegrating into violence.
We must take this seriously," he told the "Neue Presse" published in Hanover.
Not all young people would be able to cope with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The Federation, the federated states and the communes were already working hard to reduce the problems, Schäuble said.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"From integration summits to conferences on Islam, this already shows its first successes."
However, it would be too early for an end to the warning.
Schäuble points out at the same time as in the German suburbs, there are no sociological problems or from the point of view of urbanism as in France.
In the Parisian agglomerations of the north, young people had engaged in serious street battles with the police during the last nights.
In Toulouse too, cars and public buildings burned down.
This is what the President of the Turkish communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat, called for from the German government for greater integration efforts.
Taking into account the riots in France, Kolat warned against the "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
However, there would still be a need to act.
Kolat emphasizes that the unemployment rate among young people under 25 from immigration would be above the average.
First and foremost, more places should be provided for training.
Kolat insisted: "We must give young people a perspective".
The President of the Turkish communities, however, added that social control in families took place more in Germany than in France.
Many young immigrants don’t want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat exhorted, "But we must still be careful."
"Young people should be given the opportunity to participate in work and training."
Meanwhile, in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very quiet during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter was flying over the area with spotlights.
The authorities in charge reported three arrests as well as a few burned cars and garbage.
Since the conference, a deployment of about 1,000 security forces has ensured calm.
The police will intervene for as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced, after a visit to the suburb.
On Tuesday night, nearly 80 policemen were injured in the riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The next night, the trouble was overflowing in Toulouse.
The riots broke out after a traffic accident in which two young people had lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first elements of the Prosecutor's Office, the police are not responsible for the deaths of young people.
In the Empire of Angela Merkel.
The chancellor’s utopian entry shows that the coalition is done with the bottom – and that there is nothing more to expect from her.
In which country does the Chancellor live?
After his disastrous intervention in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor in content, it is necessary to say: not here - not in the country that should, in the end, be governed by it.
The accusation of too much focus on politics was pushed back by Angela Merkel from a harsh and presumptuous sentence.
It is provincial, she said, and has only shown by that that she does not want to understand what the critics want.
In Parliament, she made visible to everyone how accurate this accusation was.
There was neither concrete interest nor little feeling for the country's problems to be felt.
Instead, Angela presented herself as a cloud: a weightless politician, who flees into foreign policy and even remains in the immediate vicinity.
For example, climate protection: in this respect, it repeatedly welcomes the Heiligendam agreements, but does not say how the climate objectives should be achieved in our country.
Even self-praise - having so little modesty, the head of the CDU would have refused it two years ago.
Now it clings to all-out formulas, that growth would affect people.
In doing so, she destroys her image as a pragmatist, who solves problems instead of embellishing the world.
But in the Angela cloud empire, domestic policy issues are a marginal phenomenon.
Poverty among children and the concerns of low-wage workers?
There are a few additional phrases for that.
In this regard, it is revealing how many times it makes lapses when it comes to family allowance.
Here, Merkel needs three starts to utter a half-precise sentence.
She hesitates in unfamiliar terrain, from the moment it becomes concrete.
The Attack Branch
In the YouTube debate of Republican presidential candidates, two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are engaged in a tough offensive battle – and must now fear an outsider candidate.
Tension among candidates already erupts on the first topic.
He would have made New York a "refugee for illegals," Mitt Romney blamed his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
The former governor of Massachusetts has been accused of employing undocumented immigrants, saying: “I would say his own house was a haven for illegals,” Giuliani said.
The candidates go up to the attack: as the Republican base also has no official favorites, the eight presidential candidates use the debates on CNN above all to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur movies that Internet users have sent via YouTube are barely more than blowers.
“It’s with this kind of isolationism that we let Hitler come to power,” McCain told his candidate Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to demand an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney also gets the lesson vigorously from Vietnam's veterans, when he refuses to condemn as torture what is called "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation in which drowning is simulated.
However, the fact that the important themes of the campaign in the meantime go beyond the war in Iraq and the debates on torture can be seen in the reactions of the St. Petersburg common room in Florida.
Whether conservative values are rented out or future tax increases are denied, applause is pouring into the auditorium.
This is where once again the weaknesses of the two favorites are revealed.
“I made a mistake at the time,” Romney said, apologizing to the base and television audience for being a supporter of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, passes into a flowing knot when asked his opinion on literal interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf ruled for the first time in civilian life.
A day after his retirement as army chief, the Pakistani man of power Musharraf was inaugurated as president.
Thus, eight years of domination by the army end.
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in Thursday for a new five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the presidential palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the Constitution and act for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his position as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus bowed to international pressure, including that of the United States.
Eight years after his takeover by a bloodless coup, the former general now reigns for the first time as civilian head of state.
By withdrawing from the post of commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled the main demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf had decreed on November 3.
Soon after his inauguration, Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and thus fulfill another requirement of the West.
The country's Supreme Court, which Musharraf had occupied after the state of emergency with lawyers from his ranks, had rejected all appeals against the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy, and four others wounded.
According to the army spokesman, a bomb exploded in a street near the border of Afghanistan.
The Krautrock Fathers are coming back.
The supergroups of Germany of the seventies are playing again: the three members of the group Harmonia again took their console in a concert in Berlin.
For their return, recordings of their great success "Live 1974" were released.
Already at that time, they were much more known abroad.
The expected sensation then occurs in the form of three gentlemen announced at the evening poster.
Everyone has their little box in front of them, their cable and, above all, their buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63, sits in the middle in a snow-white shirt.
He is flanked to the left by Michael Rother, a 57-year-old with a laptop and guitar.
To the right, observed by the whole auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, bends over his console.
Everyone contributes to the noise, including even a Beat.
And sometimes this inadvertently adds to a piece of traditional music.
This does not seem to disturb the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the group Harmonia is playing again has ensured a few emojis among Krautrock fans.
We have the right to reveal it here: targeted polls reveal that, of course, the name makes sense in the collective memory of pop, but in no way in such a lasting way that this group has been so painfully missing for 32 years.
But why wouldn’t Germans also have the right to celebrate their living legends of the seventies?
Especially since what is deceptively called "Krautrock" has always rained more in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Award in 2003 to the survivors of the Cologne Can group for their work, German pop faces were seen in the room interrogating.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the panegyric praise, the astonishment had no limits.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother jumped onto the Red Hot Chili Peppers stage as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and transfiguration into the unknown is the only one.
The memory is of this fact already taken by Harmonia, because the trio only existed for two years and only during this period the impact power that felt was much weaker than what was attributed to it later by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
We first played in the cellars below the Berlin stage.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a label subsidized by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother had briefly troubled himself in Kraftwerk and had finally made a name for himself as a guitarist with Neu!, which at the time was perhaps the most radical German band.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed Cluster musicians into exile in the Weserbergland forests.
There, in an old Weser farm, a ruin of the 16th century, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the community "Kommune I", where Roedelius had the right to be tormented as a nurse.
Rather an artistic existence in the manner of Spitzweg.
There was supposedly in the trash can a fan of the Harmonia Ottenstein choir and also a name for the art.
Many retain Harmony away from that.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonie", and the next "De Luxe".
As calm and modest as the music sounded, the band suffered material misery.
The harvest of dead wood did not serve itself in the quest for self.
The CD "Live 1974" that has just been released was recorded during a concert in Griessem in front of a record audience of almost 50 heads, as well as someone who thinks he remembers.
Rother at that time issued the wish to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
This was an immoral requirement for Roedelius and Moebius.
The group announced its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the spheres of esotericism and secured his existence with albums such as "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster revived in the 1980s and has since been more successful than Harmonia has ever been.
We owe Griessem's Live album to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His label Grönland set itself the goal of maintaining Krautrock as an inherent German contribution to contemporary music.
Neu! had already been unearthed on this occasion as the personal work of Roedelius.
Harmonia’s physical resurrection takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
Publicly subsidized, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, former punk and author of the pocket book "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the inventor of the Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the entire fluctuating margin of Krautrock's influence would be defined with respect to future pop music.
The space left empty by the group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno’s phrase flies in the room amidst the singular sounds: “The only true music, you listen to the future.”
There are pictures that show the producers with Harmonia in the room of the farm.
The projections of other black and white pictures of wired tools in bazaar serve to form the legend.
In front, the three veterans are once again busy improvising.
But more by sticking microphones to the organ and the drums, to pull the instruments from unheard-of sounds thanks to the effects instruments built themselves.
Today, electronic music is similar to electronic music.
All three in great technical fiddlers.
Even the choir of the house will not change that.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, one coughs and whispers under the cloud of sounds, and sings at a nice moment "Aaaaaaaah" with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It was never about rock.
Roots were less sought after in the blues than in music conservatories (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the flight of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
The one who shouts "68" is not totally wrong, and Harmonia too now does not get irritated by it anymore.
But what goes the most will be meticulously covered on stage.
Where does music begin and where does it end?
This can knock on someone’s nerves (?) or grant fleeting moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Murdering Peace", two films again address the Balkan War.
But the two do not convince.
Either the projects are too much based on action and on the exchange of insane shots or on the contrary they are too tearful.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news first: the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but it is precisely there, in the darkest backcountry of the Bosnian war, that the actor Richard Gere is then found.
We had finally lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties, because too many kind and nude roles in sentimental women’s films and too many press conferences on the theme of Buddhism delighted him to show off.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument for watching "The Hunting Party" anyway - when the hunter becomes the hunter (why do today's movies have to be as long and confusing as collective conventions of locomotive drivers?)
He delivers a magnificent representation full of winks: in the end, his war reporter Simon Hunt character is what Gere could have become, if the fate and the film industry were not so benevolent: a man who has his best moments for a long time behind him, but who, even as a ruined monument to his declining age, has yet to be seen.
But despite this asset, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production "Murder Peace", which also comes out this week, the endless sequel of failed films about the Balkan war.
The trial of "Murder Peace" can be quickly made: the film talks about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who rescue a Serb from the Kosovo Freemasons, in which one of the two still fall promptly in love.
Although it is welcome that here the Serbs are not for once presented as the only causes of all ills, this film as flat as a telefilm gets lost far too quickly in the action and the exchange of insane shots.
It remains a sort of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway but with a war in place.
On the contrary, we can examine in the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why in the end there was never a really good film about the Balkan war.
The story of the three American war reporters, who condition themselves to track down the top war criminal "the fox", might have become, with another director and another screenwriter (both at once Richard Shepard), at another time a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because the stories look strikingly similar: two males go on a small team in the forest, to accomplish something the military can’t do and for both males, it becomes a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that we simply don't let Simon Hunt be the deserted cynical with a heart, as he is presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also attribute to her a romantic adventure with a Bosnian woman who was later murdered.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitely bad, when the reporter, in the last five minutes, through an accelerated process, achieves that NATO, the CIA and all the premium hunters in the world have not succeeded in five years: catch the war criminal and leave him for a just revenge on the Muslim Bosnians.
This is so bad that the International Criminal Court of The Hague should be prosecuted against cinematographic logic.
In this case, the film has too deep a human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still free, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they have to agree exceptionally) of not conducting the hunt quite intensively due to secret political agreements.
But the well-intentioned and the bad are this time so similar that a famous poem by Brecht comes to mind.
He talks about a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's desk: "Compassionately, I see the veins of the forehead swollen, clearly: how tired it is to be mean."
Movies like "The Hunting Party" have exactly such tumultuous heads, but that insinuate how tiring it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of films about the Balkan war.
Recently, it was reported in this newspaper that all the Hollywood films about Iraq were big flops.
We can add: there have never been good films about South Africa before.
What is worth every time: when a star hangs on a crisis home or on a minefield, he then comes out something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jenseits gehen Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still simply too close in time.
In any case, decades have always passed before Hollywood can make a good Holocaust film with Schindler's List.
Some films still have to mature - those that are worth classic works on Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" were in no way celebrated unanimously in their time as masterpieces.
But perhaps we also know too much today about the conflicts of the world, where each hecatomb comes live on two screens at the same time at home,
And that delights the writers in the lack of scruples they need to tell beautiful stories.
“To be or not to be” or “The Dictator” have actually become as good as well because Lubtisch and Chaplin did not yet know how much the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe you don’t want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Perhaps it is necessary to have the sarcastic and distant artistic gaze of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Lempri<0xC3><0xA8>re's Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied: "It's just that some things never change."
“The big cities will always be horribly dangerous, the men will always be murdered in a horribly horrific way, and the war will always reign in Yugoslavia.”
Von Beust received criticism for the cancellation of the Olympics.
The mayor's regression from Hamburg's bid for the Summer Olympics has met with virulent criticism in politics and the economy.
Many want to keep fighting for the Games on the waterfront.
But Von Beust calls for realism in the appreciation of chances.
The chief executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described an abandonment on Wednesday as "bad for the local economy".
In recent times, no other project had deployed as much motivational force in the city as the idea of the Olympics.
"Without this objective, the political and sporting momentum could not have been maintained in the same measures."
Schmidt-Trenz urges the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new, longer-term starting point, "which takes another modified agenda as its starting point."
Mayor Ole von Beust stayed on Wednesday to his previous statements, according to which Hamburg's Olympic ambitions were unrealistic until at least 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides on a bid for the Olympics, but the German Federation of Olympic Sports," Von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He refers to the expected decision of the Sports Federation in early December, regarding Munich's candidacy for the 2018 Winter Games.
This preference means for us that, in the time frame we had planned until 2028, we will have no chance.”
However, the dream does not definitely belong to the past, said Von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted Beust’s statements.
This would give the impression that Hamburg does not want to run for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to close an opportunity, burying the projects already now," HSB President Günter Plöß said on Wednesday.
An abandonment of the candidacy would further contradict the statements of the head of the Senate on the occasion of the reception in the plenary assembly of the German Federation of Higher Schools of Sport.
There, Von Beust would have described Hamburg's bid for the 2015 Universiade as "not a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Federation of Higher Schools of Sport had first appointed Hamburg as a candidate city in the past few weeks.
The mayor’s SPD faction has accused the Senate of not using this precious time in the construction of housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the Little Grasbrook has been denied by the Senate for years because it played the Olympic card and excluded the construction of housing," said SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always called for the Little Grasbrook to have an integrated plan in the Olympics and a later use of housing, the CDU would have relied exclusively on the "Event factor".
The bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics, for its part, would have raised a lot of enthusiasm in Hamburg.
Hamburg, however, had broken up against Leipzig.
They're not Warhol's crates.
The one who connects the concepts Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
At the moment, wooden crates made in Sweden are casting shadows on the list of Warhol's works.
A large part of the eighty Brillo-Boxes of "Type Stockholm" listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned the international authenticity of Andy Warhol's 1968 Brillo-Boxes a few months ago, the internal research of the Moderna Museet in Stockholm today leads to a disappointing result: the other six "Brillo-Boxes", of which the former director of the Moderna-Boxes museum is made in 1995 by the Pontus Hul.
The ancient history is entangled, a disconcerting chain of artistic and curative productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, painted wooden boxes, which are based on the red-blue-white design of the "Brillo" powdered soap boxes.
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet presented in 1968 - with Warhol's agreement - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: These did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but had been delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
These were not works of art, but rather their models, exhibition samples.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to produce some Brillo wooden crates in Sweden, which were not exhibited at the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time now speak of about fifteen wooden crates that at the time would have entered the history of art and auctions, as original Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol allowed, with the appellation "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have reached more than $100,000 in auction sales.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén museum falsely claimed later that about a hundred wooden crates had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol would later cede to him.
In fact, the 105 Hultén crates were produced in Malmö in 1990 alone, for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By that time, Warhol had already been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief curator of the Moderna Museet, examined, next to the museum's six Brillo-Boxes, three other Swedish private collections, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their laminated panels were first printed and sculpted, then applied with a brush of paint to white.
The texture of the copies dating back to 1990, on the contrary, reveals that the paint was directly applied without a background layer to the laminated panels, using a roll of paint - moreover, it is not an oil paint, but an acrylic.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes," says the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New-York does not come in so much class as a decision, the Moderna Muse will make six
As early as July, the Authentication Board of course announced that it would investigate the “heavy charges” that will be raised in the case of powdered soap boxes.
But since then, there has been an inexorable silence.
Rebel soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, the rebel soldiers abandoned, the same ones who had locked themselves in a hotel in Manila, and who had demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who accused the President of corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters at the hotel that he could not answer for any bloodshed.
The soldiers in power had just stormed the hotel with tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had been trapped in the building for hours.
About half of them stood before the courts on Wednesday because of a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He took advantage of the audience to suddenly eclipse himself with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police, who normally had to monitor them, had apparently deserted in his favor and joined his mutiny.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal troops in power closed the area around the respectable hotel.
The Chairperson convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"People have had enough," said Trillanes.
“We call on people to join us.”
General Danilo Lim, who commanded the Ranger Scouts' elite unit, said other army units were about to join the march.
Critics of the regime had called for a major demonstration against the President on Wednesday.
His government has been surrounded for months by accusations of corruption.
The financial district of Manila was already since 2003 the scene of the attempted mutiny of about 200 members of the army against Arroyo.
The insurrection broke down nearly 24 hours after the army refused to join it.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet has secured a stake of more than 20 percent in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as reported by the company on Wednesday.
Only 20.05 percent of the share capital would be held.
We had previously speculated on a buyback.
The option would remain open to further increase participation in Versatel.
With this step, we are trying to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet said.
Just before, assumptions had already been made on Wednesday about an entry, after Berenberg bank increased its stake in the Düsseldorf network operator from 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The credit institution would hold the money only for a third, according to the market.
The day before, United Internet had already acquired a stake of nearly 10 percent in the mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch has listed 17.4 million new shares worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>106.4 million.
United Internet bought 5.15 million for 31.1 million euros.
In addition, the companies have opened negotiations on cooperation in the marketing of DSL and mobile telephony products.
“We are strengthening our partnership,” said a United Internet spokesperson.
The two companies founded the joint-stock company MSP in order to absorb the competitor Freenet.
At the moment, the two companies want to be satisfied with their ten percent stake in Freenet, and not make use of their right to add an additional 18.49 percent to Freenet, United Internet said on Thursday.
The two companies, however, would leave all options open, particularly to increase participation in SA Freenet, it was learned.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet about a strategic partnership had ended in mid-October.
Poker still difficult to predict on Freenet that lasts for months is part of the consolidation of the German telecoms market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million customers linked by a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million DSL customers and full subscriptions.
The holding company of United Internet and Drillisch held a direct stake in Freenet of 6.01 percent.
It was now agreed that Drillisch would bring about an additional four percent.
The right to buy the 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas had already been decided in August.
