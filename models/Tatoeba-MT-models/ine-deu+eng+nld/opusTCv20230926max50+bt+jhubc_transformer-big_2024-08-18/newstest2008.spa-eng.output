European inflation slipped into food
Accelerated inflation, recorded in the euro area, is primarily due to the dizzying growth in the price of food products.
The rise in prices in November has been higher than expected in the 13 countries of the euro area, registering - after the 2.6 percent of the month of October - an annual inflation of 3.1 percent - announced the Statistical Office of the Union based in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts gave only 3 percent as likely, Bloomberg said.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the U.S., British and Canadian issuing banks, did not cut the basic interest, on the pretext that the decline, along with rising commodity prices and the reduction in forced unemployment, would trigger an inflation spiral.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but at least close to two percent.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in the trap of 22: "negotiating" on inflation so that it does not have to intervene on this issue later.
Inflation of 3.3 percent, recorded in Germany, broke the 12-year record; while in Spain it rose from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
Inflation has skyrocketed in the euro area as a result of galloping food and energy prices.
Wheat futures prices increased by 88 percent and soybean prices also reached their highest level since 1973.
Similarly, much more had to be paid in 2007 for vegetable oil and dairy products.
The price of crude oil in the world market rose this year by 52 percent, reaching almost $100 a barrel as early as last month.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will jump from the current 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent, while in 2009 it will drop to 1.9 percent.
According to analysts, annual inflation will remain around 3 percent in the next 3 or 4 months, but the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to double interest rates during 2008.
Gallup predicts a government crisis
After a long stagnation, by early December the support of the Young Democrats Alliance increased significantly, reaching its peak since 2002, while the Gallup had never before experienced such a low – 13 percent – level in the case of the Socialists.
The difference in the case of safe party voters - due to the greater firmness of opposition voters - would mean support of more than two-thirds (71 percent) versus support of a fifth for socialists (20 percent).
According to the survey, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats would not reach even the limit necessary to have any parliamentary seat: their support within the entire population is two percent.
Among the safe voters there are one percent more sympathizers on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even compared to the previous lowest point - it has never been so high, 41 percent the proportion of those who judged the country's economic situation especially bad, while another 46 percent believe the situation is quite bad.
Families, after the most hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic about changing their own economic situation.
As far as next year is concerned, the majority of the population is in worsening condition and only one-tenth expects improvement.
In December, 71 percent of those polled, more than any previous Gallup poll, felt that the President was performing poorly rather than well.
13 percent of respondents trust or rely heavily on Ferenc Gyurcs<0xC3><0xA1>ny, while Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n has the support of 38 percent of respondents.
54 percent of the population does not trust the head of government at all and 27 percent do not trust the president of the Young Democrats Alliance.
One of the indicators of the configuration of the political situation is that, what proportion of society thinks it is possible to control the discontent experienced with the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
While after the October riots last year 35 percent thought it would be desirable to keep the government and the head of government in power, currently this proportion is only 20 percent, while the relative majority (33 percent) believe that the only solution is to hold new elections.
Interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 percent of respondents to the participation question answered that they would certainly participate and another 20 percent said that they are likely to participate.
By comparison, only 55 percent of the population would participate in "a general election to be held this Sunday" and another 15 percent believe their participation is likely. Based on the current intentions of the voters, there is no doubt about the result of the popular poll.
Seventy-four percent of the population would disapprove of the payment of tuition fees, 79 percent would disapprove of the medical consultation service and 84 percent would disapprove of hospital care.
If we looked at these proportions only among the safe participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would reject the introduction of study rights, payment for medical consultations and hospital care.
The most expensive is the Auchan, Tesco has fivefold its prices
The average price level increase of 16 percent was maintained by the hypermarkets of the Budaörs gold trading triangle, with the difference that VAT has not been increased this year.
Article by Napi Gazdas<0xC3><0xA1>g
This year, the usual Christmas basket of the Napi newspaper also increased by an average of 16 percent in the Budaörs gold commercial triangle, but in all hypermarkets growth was recorded well above the thousand HUF.
As prices in food supermarkets had already “fired” in December last year, there was no dramatic percentage increase compared to the high starting point.
However, it is obviously frightening for consumers that what they were able to buy last year at a price well below nine thousand HUF, today they cannot do it for ten thousand.
The Napi basket in the hypermarkets studied exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF with a minimum of 91 HUF.
And the highest value basket was 10 573 HUF.
(in 2003 that basket cost 6800 HUF.)
The price of Unicum liquor and fish remained almost at the level of the previous year, but there was a sharp increase in turkey breast fillet, nut and poppy seed.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed the data of the Central Bureau of Statistics, although in Auchan we have also found a kilo of bread for the price of 139 HUF.
The competition did not reduce the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
It was equally surprising in this store that the price of Coca-Cola with a two-litre bottle cost less than 200 HUF, so this product, even with the price of the bottle, cost only 257 HUF.
However, in the basket of Napi Auchan was the most expensive, while Cora the cheapest.
According to our calculations, compared to last year’s Christmas prices, Cora increased by 15, while Tesco and Auchan increased by about 18 percent the prices listed in Napi’s basket.
Comparing the values of last year’s most expensive basket with that of this year’s cheapest basket, the difference has been 12 percent, while the growth between last year’s cheapest and this year’s most expensive basket has been 21 percent.
The average growth was 1480 HUF.
Last year the average price growth was 1206 HUF, so during Christmas last year in prices was felt the increase in VAT.
It was precisely this process that shattered trade, supermarkets were visibly unable to decide on the price margin to be applied for each product and to calculate the effect of the change in prices on consumption.
(If the trader misplans the speed of a product’s circulation, you may lose a significant profit in the margin that fits the sales volume.)
The increase in the price of the Napi basket reached such extremes as a result of the increase in VAT, that the most expensive was higher with 1720 HUF than the value recorded in 2006, while in the cheapest the difference was only 844 HUF.
Such extremes did not occur this year, as the highest price now has been 1630 HUF more than last year and the cheapest also increased by 1284 HUF.
Comparing the two holiday seasons, catastrophic growth in prices was recorded in less than 20 months, in hypermarkets the price of essential consumer goods grew by more than 30 percent.
(However, this does not necessarily confirm the figures of the Central Bureau of Statistics: this office, in the case of some basic necessities food recorded in the 12-month interval a price increase of more than 30 percent.
So for example, in addition to wheat, also in the case of the egg.)
According to the Napi basket, in the latter case this seems almost impossible, because in the price of this product that was quite expensive already last year compared to the base, there was, in the worst case, only a 10 percent increase in prices.
According to all the indices, flour suppliers have a stronger position than egg suppliers, and can impose the drastic increase in prices even on multinationals.
Hypermarkets do not complain in the gold trading triangle, they constantly talk about positive results.
According to our collected experiences, most of the consumers in the three stores visited are no longer interested in prices.
Of all the products they buy large quantities, taking by pallets the preserved food.
On Wednesday morning, the three stores formed large queues in front of the boxes because the number of customers suddenly increased.
However, we have information that in the country sales volumes are lower, numerous multinationals complain to survey institutes because revenues are below their plans and not only in the case of food, but also in that of household appliances.
In many hospitals it is saved with disinfectants
This year, several thousand infections caused primarily by the misuse of antibiotics have been recorded in hospitals.
The prevailing hygienic conditions in hospitals, overcrowding of beds and staff overload do not favor infection control - says the head of the medical department of the National Center for Epidemiology.
In many hospitals it is saved even with disinfectants.
A MRSA infection has recently been diagnosed in the traumatology department of J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Hospital.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident, the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of infection occurred in this same hospital earlier this year.
A person injured in a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital and the same patient soon afterwards had to return to the hospital as a result of the MRSA infection and since then it has not been possible to perform a major surgical intervention due to the presence of the bacteria in his body.
As of December 10 this year, 1094 cases of hospital infection caused by multidrug-resistant agents have been reported in the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröcz, chief physician at the National Center for Epidemiology.
This means that in hospitals this number of infections caused by multi-resistant agents has been safely recorded, otherwise no information is available.
About two-thirds (683 cases) of infections are due to MRSA, i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, which is resistant to methicillin-oxacillin.
A third of humans carry the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus (SA) in their noses without causing any disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. throat inflammation, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infections) react well to antibiotics and are easy to treat.
However, once over- or unduly applied to antibiotics, bacteria that normally react well to antibiotics turn into highly antibiotic-resistant bacteria and quickly become infected in inadequate hospital conditions.
They can cause serious hospital infections, such as wound infections or septicemia in the first place to patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, to patients with a weakened body, to the elderly or to people of low weight.
In the opinion of the chief medical officer of J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Hospital there is nothing special about MRSA infection, these infections are daily in hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is only absent - said Tibor Nyulasi - where its presence is not examined.
Resistant to antibiotics
"These patients are isolated, the nursing staff treats them in rubber gloves and mask, and there are antibiotics suitable for their treatment," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Hospitalized patients are pre-examined to check for MRSA in their body, but even so infection cannot be avoided in all cases.
It is not fashionable to take samples
It would be possible to prevent hospital MRSA infections in most cases, however the current national hospital circumstances do not favor the prevention of formation and contagion with multi-resistant pathogens - says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection occurs primarily in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should examine hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients who carry MRSA in their body.
However, in Hungarian hospitals it is not fashionable to take microbiological samples.
This is also due to the fact that the National Health Fund does not fund these medical examinations.
So most of the cases come to light when the already visible MRSA infections occur in the patient - said the doctor-in-chief of the epidemiological center.
The European Union makes stringent commitments for the application of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives to treat infections and pathological conditions.
Efforts should be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, i.e. microbiological tests should be performed to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
Taking microbiological samples are even less common in the case of walking patients or in basic care - said Karolina Böröcz.
It is saved with disinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases MRSA is transmitted from one patient to another through healthcare personnel.
Therefore, hand washing, the use of rubber gloves and masks play a very important role, but also in this regard considerable faults are experienced in hospitals.
MRSA is contagious through drop-borne transmission and direct contact between people, however in national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
Moreover, hospital rooms are often crowded, beds are often very close together, although to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated by at least a distance of 1.5 meters.
Unfortunately it can also be experienced - added Karolina Böröcz - that in the hospitals of less favorable economic situation is saved with disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and therefore there is a higher probability of infection.
In the opinion of Karolina Böröcz, where appropriate preventive measures are implemented, fewer infections of this type are recorded or the infection of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government Program Against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection is a huge expense for the National Health Insurance Fund, so in all countries it is fought against.
In England, for example, there is a government program to prevent and reduce MRSA cases.
Apparently the program is successful, according to the data provided, MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of multi-resistant agents (including MRSA) and hospital infections due to these pathogens.
Negative control of alcoholemia of the police commander who caused a fatal accident
The official expert report on the case of the fatal accident caused by the district police commander XXII has been made.
The possibility that he was driving drunk or in a stunned state can be ruled out the since resigned police commander of the XXII district, who on Tuesday crashed and caused the death of a passerby - reported Friday Attila Morvai, a spokesman for the Attorney General of the capital, after having prepared the expert report on the case.
The expert report confirmed the outcome of the primary control of alcoholemia that had already found that the former police commander did not consume alcohol before getting behind the wheel.
The then head of the police station of the XXII district, on Tuesday with his private vehicle when bend Kossuth Lajos street of the XXII district ran over a 55-year-old man, who intended to cross the street, but not in the designated area for pedestrians.
(The latter fact, i.e., that the pedestrian did not use the zebra to cross the street, according to the regulations of the Transit Code are not mitigating circumstances, the driver must always give way when bending.)
The passerby lost his life after being hospitalized.
As a result, the district police chief resigned and requested his retirement, according to the police statement, because he was very moved by the case.
The investigation of the case is in charge of the Budapest Investigative Prosecutor’s Office.
Attila Morvai also said that the former police commander from the beginning collaborated with prosecutors in charge of the investigation.
<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million more for infrastructure
Hungarian Finance Minister J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres and European Investment Bank (EIB) Vice President Marta Gajecka signed three <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million credit-limit agreements in Budapest on Friday to finance education, transport and environmental infrastructure, as well as the energy sector.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million budget to finance in the Hungarian budget transport and environmental protection projects, which will be carried out from the grant of cohesion funds, of which the parties had already signed a credit agreement worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million, the contract that they have just signed refers to the use of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million.
The EUR 150 million credit contract is also intended to finance the budget for educational projects.
The EIB approved a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million for this Hungarian objective, on the use of the remaining <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million will be decided later, by extending the credit contract.
The parties signed a contract for 50 million euros for innovations, which the budget will mainly use for the innovations and research project of the University of Debrecen.
During the talks they also covered the issue of the construction of the 4th line of the Metro.
It was agreed that by the time Hungary finalizes with the EU the details of the financing of the Metro, they will again deal with the issue of whether or not it is necessary to modify the original contract and how to do so.
According to J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres, this may take place earlier in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary worth EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest on the loans is in line with EURIBOR and the EIB offers an 8-year grace period, free of charge for keeping the loan available to the debtor.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is admirable - the attention of all Europe is directed towards that Balkan country just mentioned.
What, where and who buys in the even cheaper EU market, which will quickly become more expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The preferred target for real estate purchases in Eastern Europe is undoubtedly some Bulgaria, with its cheap apartments from the ski slopes and the villas from the beaches.
The mountainous regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most preferred, while in the beaches of Albena, the "Golden Coast", the "Sun Coast", the ancient Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are looking for properties also in the surroundings of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, sooner or later also the central area of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will arouse the interest of real estate developers and more and more people will buy real estate in the especially cheap area of Rus.
Similarly, the capital Sofia will be attractive, the commercial and office spaces promise a rapid recovery of the investment.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe, thus being a prominent destination also during the other two seasons, in addition to summer and winter.
Therefore, cautious investors are already making their purchases, for example in the vicinity of Bansko.
According to analysts, those who buy real estate in Bulgaria are also striving to change their lives and way of life.
Most of the customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly from Romania.
Also present are the Maltese and Cypriot promoters and traditionally there are many Russian customers on the beaches of the Black Sea and in the skiing paradises.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups - says Georgi Jankov, regional director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who intend to settle here buy new or renovated properties for a price between 50 and 100 thousand euros or old houses in poor condition between 5 and 15 thousand euros, to renovate them later.
They require good communication and access, in addition to them the proximity of a large city, shops and usually a local doctor is important.
The second category consists of the buyers of villas (Bulgaria in December was included in the top 10 holiday destinations of the Germans).
The third group consists of real estate investors who make their purchases in the hope of benefiting in the medium or long term.
The price of capital real estate is constantly growing, as demand is increasing.
Although Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices in the European Union, in the last five years these have experienced an annual increase of 21 percent.
The rise in the price of real estate far outweighs wage growth.
Fodor and the six hundred Hungarians
According to the Minister of Environment and Hydrology G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor, the meetings at the expert level will end on Tuesday and on Wednesday after the official inauguration, negotiations at the ministerial level on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are discussing the Bali Roadmap on post-reduction efforts, as set out in the Kyoto Protocol, in force until 2012.
There are currently lively discussions on the specifics between developing and industrialized countries.
The United States has already indicated that it does not want to negotiate on precise figures at the moment, although it tends to agree that, compared to the situation in 1990, by 2020 emissions of greenhouse gases will decrease by 25 to 40 percent.
Another major theme of the conference is whether or not industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are willing to offer material and technological assistance to countries in need.
A further agreement was reached on the aid to be offered to developing countries.
The support fund, foreseen in the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a 16-member board of directors, probably within the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF) - writes the "Piac és Profit".
The Six Percentage of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Minister of Environment and Hydrology G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor supports the EU’s efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate protection and promote the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
The minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing by 20 percent its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, compared to the 1990 level, regardless of whether or not the "post-2012 agreement" will be signed and is willing to commit to reducing by as much as 30 percent if the other major developed regions of the world and the developing countries are also willing to compromise.
G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor noted that the signatory countries of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol pledged to decrease by 5.2 percent, within which the then 15 EU member states pledged to meet an 8 percent decrease.
Hungary’s commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent over the period between 1985 and 87, which our country will meet, according to a press release from the Ministry of the Environment.
There is a lot at stake in Bali, since in two years the international agreement on long-term climate policy will have to be signed, because if not, it is certain that its entry into force would be postponed to after 2012. In this case the reduction commitments, assumed in the Kyoto Protocol, would not be immediately followed by a new international system of emission reductions, which was the most recently adopted by the UN.
As a result, the reduction of emissions would be delayed and an increase of more than 2°C in the average temperature of the Earth could not be prevented, a fact that scientists say would have immeasurable and irreversible consequences.
British Army Recruits on YouTube
British army units at a video distributor publish footage of actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
First, the British Air Force (RAD) took advantage of YouTube services: special units deployed in Afghanistan since March 2006 are uploading videos of their actions against the Taliban, the BBC reported.
These recordings made with mini cameras mounted on the helmets are controlled in Kandahar’s general body of operations, then sent to London to be uploaded to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable.
There are already 139 recordings from the air force soldiers that have been uploaded in this way to the Internet and its "channel" has already been seen by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered in the spring of 2007 under the name "defence headquarters" and publishes videos of both actions perpetrated in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Commonwealth Office and the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Category: Operations in Afghanistan
Originally the air force had uploaded the videos for recruitment purposes, but in the opinion of the Ministry of Defense they also serve to present to the public the true purpose of the presence of the British army abroad.
This kind of propaganda costs practically nothing compared to conventional recruitment television spots - said the BBC defense expert Gordon Mackenzie - on the other hand, inevitably have some political message, since in a specific way they justify the reason for the military actions decided by the government.
The Americans have made a video game.
The army is also concerned about the fact that, in addition to the recklessly edited and censored recordings, there are also amateur videos on the distributor, for example about the death of the soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a little hypocritical, the officers speak of maximum losses, without presenting the bloody part of the fighting.
In addition, from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan, numerous videos recorded in real operations have already been uploaded to the Internet, but the British army is only recently taking advantage of this opportunity.
Americans use a slightly different form for recruiting with free downloadable shooting video games, called America's Army, in which in the midst of a more or less real situation the player can put himself directly in place of the soldiers.
Tombola and salt cake at the Christmas party of ministries
Labour Minister M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperth does not seem very sentimental: instead of the Christmas party, she will hold a working meeting for her colleagues who will be able to say goodbye to 2007 with salty cake and coffee.
There is a ministry that will celebrate their party with live music, in another they will create the Christmas atmosphere in the heart of public officials with a toast and a toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - this is how you have fun power.
The state offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas party will be held at the Ministry of Defense, but not for Ministry workers.
The children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts on Orphan Christmas, and for Missionary Christmas the relatives of the soldiers who are currently on missions abroad will be invited, as well as a reception for the press.
This portfolio will allocate 25 million for the festive atmosphere of the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (ANF) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) will hold a luxurious party with respect to the parties of the other portfolios
The party of the MET will be held in the House of the Future, with a total budget of HUF 4,320,000 and the presence of approximately three hundred and fifty of the six hundred workers of the ministry is expected.
At the party of the portfolio will reign a Christmas atmosphere, artists will also perform and there will be a tombola draw.
The Christmas of the ANF cost 4,700,000 HUF and was held on Wednesday in the building of the National Council of Administration of Justice (CNAJ) with musical concerts and dinner.
The rental of the room cost a million HUF, the rest of the budget was spent on the more than four hundred guests.
We have information that workers from one of the ANF departments are also invited to another Christmas party that will be held by a competition management company called the Hungarian Center for the Economic Development of Community Funds.
For this purpose they rented the entire building of the Comedy Theatre.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA, since we are unable to communicate with the competent person.
You can attend without a suit
The CNAJ building not only hosted the party of the ANF, but also that of the Ministry of Justice and the Police, which instead of Christmas celebrated the dance of Lucia Day on December 7.
The CNAJ did not charge them anything for the use of their facilities.
Five hundred people participated in the dance.
The party began with the minister’s greetings and after dinner there was live dance music.
Answering the question of [origin] they reported: to attend the dance it was not obligatory to wear a suit or evening dress.
Health, work and local government portfolios are preparing for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organize a program and a party for its workers in its own building with a budget of HUF 400,000.
Instead, Labour Minister M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperth is not waiting for her colleagues for an official Christmas party, but for a work meeting at the end of the year.
It has the participation of one hundred and eighty guests who - as reported by the press department - will drink only coffee and salted cake, so the party will not cost more than 350,000 HUF.
The Minister for Local Governments, Gordon Bajnai instead will simply toast with his colleagues in the classroom of the Ministry for Local Governments and Territorial Development.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will hold a Christmas party in its own hall of events with the participation of 436 workers.
The Christmas party will have a budget of 2500 HUF per guest - from this budget will be paid the reception with buffet and a toast.
Since J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres is the minister, MF workers celebrate Christmas in the same way every year.
Instead, there will be no festive atmosphere, the official character will be given not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon schedule of its celebration.
The agriculture portfolio will offer a New Year's reception on January 20, in the Ministry will not celebrate Christmas.
The reception will be held at Vajdahunyad Castle in the Municipal Park and according to the portfolio, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for the 100 guests.
This - according to the press department - is going to be a very simple standing reception, to which only specialized diplomats, accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These receptions, which are held every year, begin with a brief greeting speech by the minister and end with a modest meal.
The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will not celebrate any Christmas holiday - this is what the corresponding press departments have communicated to [origin].
In the press department of the environmental portfolio, they were unable to report on the budget for the Ministry's Christmas celebrations.
What is known is that for the party to be held in the Museum of Applied Arts more than four hundred people were invited.
The forces of the giant strike are gathering
The League Trade Unions and the National Federation of Workers’ Commissions will set up a strike commission on Friday to coordinate Monday’s strike that will last indefinitely.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while Monday – the day when the final vote on the public health law will be held – will begin.
This action will certainly cause great difficulties in transport, since the railway transit will be completely stopped and until 1 p.m. the workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company will also be on strike.
In the afternoon of Friday, the League Trade Unions will report on the details of their strike on Monday, which they will hold jointly with the National Federation of Workers’ Commissions.
The strike committee of the LIGA and the National Union of Machinists will also be formed to coordinate Monday’s actions.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while the participating unions will be on strike indefinitely on Monday, if no agreement is reached with the government.
This means, that - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the law on public health - did not report on the date of the end of the strike initiated.
If the National Assembly disapproves of the public health law, the unions will immediately withdraw their call for the strike.
Instead, if the law is passed, the strike commissions will meet and decide on the future.
On the basis of the National Assembly’s Monday agenda, it is also possible that the public health law is only voted on at very early hours of the night, or perhaps around midnight.
As a result of the strike that will start on Monday, there will be significant difficulties in transport: on the railways will stop working indefinitely, in the morning may stop part of the collective transport of Budapest and more than half of the intercity bus transport of the companies Vol<0xC3><0xA1>n.
At the same time, in many parts of the country, half the roads will be closed.
Numerous unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, their names are constantly updated on the League's website.
Some unions announced their strike for an indefinite period of time, others for a definite period of time.
Until the afternoon of Thursday, the State Railway and the Free Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) could not reach an agreement even on the minimum services, although, as the Christmas holidays approach, more and more people travel on trains.
According to information received so far, from the beginning of the day until 1 pm workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company, the Budapest Airports from 7 am to 9 am, will hold a four-hour strike the LIGA Trade Unions of the Electrical and Thermal Industry.
The Hungarian Association of Physicians will take a national strike at alternative times and the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers (SDTSSS), part of the Trade Union Cooperation Forum, will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is that the government withdraw its proposal for public health reform and submit a new conception to a social debate.
The second demand is that they gradually introduce the new form of calculation of pensions that will come into force next year.
The third is that they ensure, even before 2010, for the case of advance pensions the possibility that the occupations that deserve it can enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF), which is part of the League Trade Unions, do not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on the railway side lines and look forward to another different proposal.
Political Capital[b1]: The Hungarian Guard increases the risk in the country
According to the Risk Analyzing Division of Political Capital, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, formed in August this year with the support of the Movement for a Better Hungary, has increased the political risk of Hungary and the region from several points of view.
In the company's "risk warning" it says: in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard the greatest political risk is the fact that "with the exacerbation of ethnic tensions between the Roma and non-Gypsy population of Hungary, even in the short term violent ethnic clashes may occur".
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is probably the provocation of an event of this nature - added the representative of the research institute.
They claimed that all this is due to one of the main faults of the protagonists of Hungarian political life: "the protagonists of public life gave the public debate of the Roma problem to the representatives of the radical and extremist political groups, who were able to base their political strategy on the existing discrepancies between Gypsies and Hungarians".
This aggravates the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflict erupting.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activity of the National Guard, as a result of the great attention of the national and international media, "significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, especially with regard to the stability and democratic development of the country."
We are reminded that, starting in the autumn of 2006, the reorganization of Hungary's radical and far-right groups was increasingly publicized and promoted, and that since the summer of 2007, numerous organizations have been formed in the country that define themselves as "national self-defense associations".
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civilian organizations, while openly proclaiming the training of their members for defense - even armed - (civil defense, national defense, defense of public order), alluding to the ineptitudes of the police, the army, i.e. the state," they add.
They stated: all this is done in accordance with the method that tries to give a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the dissatisfaction of society with politics and with political parties.
For highlighting the civil and the form of association in the case of these associations not only serves to avoid the legal problems of legal registration, but is also at the same time a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a risk factor also from the point of view of neighborhood relations.
“In recent months, in many neighboring states the Hungarian Guard has been referred to as a potential danger, while ultra-nationalist political figures from certain neighboring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy with the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this influences the political stability of the region," they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so political risks have increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard operates in a manner similar to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (UNB).
The constitution of the Bulgarian Guard is due to the mass riots of the Gypsies that occurred in one of the neighborhoods of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, the UNB decided to constitute the guard, arguing that the organization's goal is "national self-defense".
In his opinion, in the last 17 years there was "gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, however the state remained powerless and indifferent to the facts - recalls the Political Capital.
They added: this initiative has provoked a lively discussion in the Bulgarian public opinion.
As it was written, it indicates the increased risk of ethnic clashes that certain Gypsy organizations in Bulgaria have announced that to resist, they will constitute their own guard.
As the operation of the Hungarian Guard has so far shown similarities to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that Hungarian gypsies also react to the threat in a similar way, organizing their own self-defense - can be read in the warning on the risks of Political Capital.
Attila Juh<0xC3><0xA1>sz, director of research at Political Capital, said: “Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, every year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that can influence the change in risk, they inform the public, as happened in this case, publishing their warning about the risks.
The party is not always written with red numbers
In Hungary the law precisely defines the days that are written with red numbers on the calendar and it has already become a widespread practice that around the holidays - that next year will be less - the working days are reorganized.
Even in the EU or North America, the holidays are not unified.
Hungarian laws make a difference between a national holiday, a state holiday and a public holiday.
The festive days are fundamentally related to religious festivals and historical ephemeris.
We also celebrate the New Year: both the last day of the old year and the first day of the new year is a holiday - the latter especially so that those who spent celebrating the old year can rest.
Throughout the year we have eleven parties written with red numbers on the calendar.
It is a national holiday on March 15 in memory of the revolution of 1848 and on October 23, a day commemorating the revolution of 1956.
On August 20th we celebrate the foundation of the State, on May 1st the Labor Day, on November 1st and 2nd we remember our deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, in our country there are two-day feasts of the Passover of the Resurrection, Pentecost and Christmas.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious holidays rarely coincide with a weekend, which is why it is often bridged when there is only one working day before or after the holiday.
In exchange for the extended weekends like this, during the previous Saturdays you can not be absent from work or school.
It is the minister of labor who regulates in his specific decree when it is necessary to work exactly in exchange for the day directly before or after the party.
This legal norm is mandatory for all employers and their employees, as well as for employees and civil servants.
It is not mandatory for companies and service institutions that, due to its function, work uninterruptedly even during the holidays.
This year the work order can be altered only around the holidays of the end of the year: from December 24 practically stops life in the country, because according to experiences, most people "bridge" during the days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their vacation during these days.
Next year several of our holidays will coincide with midday or weekends, so there will be fewer changes in working days than this year.
First, the agenda will be modified around the Labor Day so that then, for four consecutive days, workers can rest.
Saturday, April 26 will be a working day, in exchange for Friday, May 2 being a holiday.
The other change relates to the October 23 holiday: on Saturday, October 18, you will have to work instead of Friday, October 24.
Instead, the coming year during the end of the year party can be rested, since from December 24 will not work anywhere, even if the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six Little Deterrents to Bitter Your Colleagues’ Lives
E-mails that we forget to send, sound messages that we never receive, innocent lies that happen to us without realizing it: all of them are part of our daily folklore at work.
You have to decide whether to adapt to small annoyances or consciously avoid confusing situations that can irritate others.
Advice.
“I’m sorry, I forgot to tell you that the marketing department was looking for you,” one of your colleagues said.
That's why you didn't go on a date?
At best, you feel it and try to fix the issue, you may call the marketing department to tell them that you forgot to deliver the message (this is the least common solution).
In most cases, the issue is resolved by apologizing.
Before proceeding to sloppy explanations, it is worth meditating on the things with which you can bitter your colleagues’ lives and consciously strive to avoid them.
Do you borrow something that is not yours?
There is nothing more annoying than when you want to grab a document, an office tool, or your phone and you don’t find them.
Remember yesterday you put the stapler on the table, but by this morning it disappeared?
Do you find your lost pen on the table of one of your colleagues?
Do not take anything from your colleagues without asking them, because they will rightly be angry with you for stealing their things.
Do not pick up envelopes or post-it from the office because it can be unpleasant when you need them immediately and they run out of time.
Are you complaining about your colleagues’ private lives?
There is no good solution to stop rumors that are already running.
Who, what are you doing and with whom?
Where and why?
Don’t pass on to everyone the information (suggestions) you have about your colleagues’ private lives!
Don’t abuse your colleague’s confidence when he shares his innermost secrets with you!
Bury in yourself what you have heard and do not gossip about your colleague in his absence, even if others also know things about him.
Are you on sick leave unnecessarily?
When you call the office and say that you are sick and your head hurts unbearably, you feel bad or well, you feel that that day you prefer to rest; think about what others should do your work, your unwashable tasks, your work in term.
Don't bother your colleague!
If you already know in advance that the next day you will not go to the office or something may happen to you, so you should stay at home, contact them, so that your colleagues or your boss do not have to face your absence the next day.
Hoarseness, laughter, phone calls
Are you caught up in your work, but are you getting rid of your colleagues’ squabbles?
Have you inadvertently heard a phone conversation that would have been better not to hear it?
Don’t annoy your colleagues with your bragging, singing, loud conversations (less when you do them over their heads), kicking them, blaspheming them constantly, expressing your discontent out loud.
All of these can be annoying, even if they are not deepening at this time in a project (writing, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for a mistake?
Don’t blame others if you haven’t finished something in time, forgot to send an important letter or message!
Don’t allude to the chaos eventually reigning in the office, nor to the noise your colleagues make!
You must recognize if you have made a mistake that harms others and you must repair the fault!
Ask how you can fix your missing!
Do you feel too much at home in the office?
Jogging and slippers: very comfortable habit for the house, but not suitable for the office!
Do not wear a comfortable jogging even if your occupation allows it!
Don’t be uneasy, respect your colleagues and yourself by wearing everyday clothes, elegant and beautiful when your occupation demands it!
You lose interest if you want to meet the expectations of the public
The car moves slowly in the usual morning traffic jam.
It sounds like a strange compass on the radio: violin with electronic effects.
I raise the volume.
Change the rhythm of the music and to the above tones is added the bass and then the voice of a female choir as a real jewel intervenes.
The mr2 channel plays the song Wings of Love by Zagar.
The national music life did not spoil us much with quality electronic pop.
But now this jam looks totally different when you’re listening to Zagar’s new album.
Some new and interesting songs from the underground [b2]digital [b3]national are gradually changing the image and although again the garage rock style, breaks guitars, the national electro pop has shown: there are novelties under the sun.
Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger started his career in the city of Pécs, played in the Yonderboi ensemble until he started his independent career perhaps because both cannot be protagonists of the same ensemble.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mix of jazz, danceable electronic music and pop, he tried to succeed, when he was asked for cinematic [b4] soundtracks (pl.
Ferenc Török Szezon).
The broader audience knew the ensemble that initially performed only in small clubs when wan2 magazine selected its first album released in 2002 among the fifty most important national records, ranking Zagar, along with Yonderboi as almost the only national trendsetter, able to sell also in Western markets.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his ensemble are fashionable, but no one has asked them if they wear this label or not.
The ensemble reacted as it should: it prepared a new and even better record.
The newly released album, titled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, will be able to open new paths for them, although the title itself aims to establish continuity with the early years in the city of Pécs.
For this title was one of the lines of the old ensemble of Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger.
The reference to the airy, about the flight, but in addition to the airy of the music, now appeared - according to the spirit and trend of the time - the guitar that sounds louder, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs he presented the album at the Millennial György Ligeti, the singer currently working in England with the ensemble The Puzzle.
The album includes a real success of the channel mr2 Pet<0xC3><0xB5>fi, which recently broadcasts popular music from morning to night. This station brought to the ears of radio listeners the high-flying music of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian singers (Divas Underground").
Everything is in order (?).
hvg.hu asked Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger.
hvg.hu: After this new success, the question arises: what are you performing, to what extent is music dedicated to a select audience?
Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger: The definition of selected audience means little to me.
In my opinion there are two types of castes in light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also the so-called underground alternative music can be boring, meaningless and can be composed equally just for sale, making it commercial.
But also a good pop song can come from a sincere inspiration.
The attitude of the listeners also works in this spirit, regardless of national languages and borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the reception of your music by Hungarian and foreign audiences?
B. Zs: Abroad, especially to the west of us, light music has bigger traditions.
There, not only the fifteen- and twenty-year-old generations attend the concerts, but also the older ones.
They pay much more attention to the changes that occur around them in light music, because they consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the public have in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they are from and how many people are listening to your music?
B.Zs: Of course I feel good seeing more and more people attend our concerts.
But we have never composed music for the market.
We do not compose music for any purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the audience is felt rather in concerts where there is a mutual influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet, I realized that if you want to meet the expectations of the public, you lose their interest.
hvg.hu: To what extent do you intend to follow Yonderboi’s example?
He works alone and made his career rather to the west of us.
B.Zs: We don’t follow his path, even though they sometimes try to compare our music to his.
We rather work as a team, rely on each other’s musical presence and let it unfold.
At first it was inevitable that they would compare our work with Yonderboi’s music, as many of us started our career in his group and from there we took a different path.
hvg.hu: In mr2 Pet<0xC3><0xB5>fi Wings of Love's hit list is in first place.
Many people first heard Zagar's name in connection with this song.
Did you consciously open with this style to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn’t intend to compose big hits and sell our record with these hits.
This song is more than that.
We added it to the end of the album, trying to relax after the album's sound orgy and the heavier tracks.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why exactly to them - what was the main motive?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a gospel-style choir.
Then came the idea of creating this chorus of the good-voice soloists from our own national music scene.
Thus was created that choir of six women - that is, Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Eniko Hodoshi [Neo] and Juci Németh - which was later baptized as Divas of Underground.
hvg.hu: Did you compose the song exactly like this or did the girls change some things?
Zs.B.: This song existed a long time ago in the instrumental version and when we already had all the material on the record, we thought that something was still missing.
The chord attracted the singing.
Even that night I recorded the song that the girls later learned.
It all came down to the first attempt and in an incredibly spontaneous way.
I remember, I was very excited then, but of course I also needed the Divas.
With my voice I would not have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: Both in the concert and on the record it seems as if the girls were in the background.
There are no soloists (except for Judy Jay’s short solo), they have no role of their own, they all sing together and no stronger than the music, so the music not only accompanies their songs.
Also on the stage they are located in the background.
Intentionally?
B.Zs: They are in the background simply for technical problems.
Instead, we consciously did not want to distribute roles of soloists.
The song is also about it, about that we forget for a while our ego, who where it has come from and where it is going, let us let those wings, the wings of love lift us up.
I wanted others to feel the euphoric mood that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: Which one did you spend the most time on?
Zs.B.: In the musical composition actually none, rather at the time of mixing there were more difficult pieces.
For example, the Dorian Gray's Dilemma in which I'm playing on a concert piano or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time I didn't want to run the groove and then, little by little, everything became like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song on the new album?
Zs.B.: This constantly changes with the concerts and because I have already "released" the album.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
A treacherous stockbroker risks billions for his inferiority complex
A disloyal villain.
This is how he points out to his former employee, Jerome Kerviel, the giant French banker of Société Générale, who also owns the Czech Commercial Bank.
For him he lost about five billion euros.
However, it seems rather that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare himself to his colleagues and certainly with good abilities.
He long ago, unlike all the big Czech banks, sensed the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"He has a fragile character" was heard from his superiors, the same ones who sent him to the police.
But what emerges from Kerviel’s responses according to what the French media, such as the newspaper Le Monde, see, is that he was a man who at the end of last year made a profit of more than 1.6 billion euros thanks to his business.
Crisis not only in America
“All I wanted to do was make money for my bank,” he said.
It was precisely in the summer that he managed to win during the American crisis, 500 million euros.
This opportunity already saw her come early in the year.
In February, some news began to be heard about so-called sub-prime mortgages offered to low-income customers or those who had problems with payments in the past and that those customers would begin to have problems.
However, this crisis should not affect the entire economy.
Kerviel did not believe it and bet correctly.
And then, at the end of the year, its profits exceeded 1.6 billion euros.
“When I made my first $500 million, I didn’t know how to notify him,” Kerviel confesses, adding that he has left nothing for himself at all.
Throughout the interrogation, he stated that he had falsified the records in such a way that his discovery would not be made.
He even went so far as to deceive the bosses, even as the Eurex Stock Exchange began to take an interest in their businesses.
The risk became a benefit.
Afraid it would be discovered?
I mean, no.
“I thought I’d made $1.6 billion for the bank and from that simple fact, that would make you happy.”
Where did you get so much willpower to take risks like that?
In my position I had to work gradually.
He joined Société Générale in 2000, just after graduating from Lyon.
His annual salary was handled between $51,000.
Two years later he was already an assistant stockbroker and in 2005 he became a stockbroker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Still, I knew I would never win as much as the others.
“In my first interview in 2005, I noticed that they were looking at me with caution.
Because of my training and also my professional and personal progress," Kerviel described to the researchers.
But shortly after my entry into the company came the first great success.
Thanks to the shares of Allianz, it won, during the bombings in London, playing down a title of 500 million euros.
And this was a boot mechanism, and he wanted more.
If you win, we leave you
“This is like a snowball,” police said.
But it is said that the chiefs knew all this or rather suspected it.
"While I was making money, they closed their eyes."
But then came the coup earlier this year.
In one day he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in mid-January, he wanted to erase all traces.
When he arrived at work on Monday, he was no longer working at the bank.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5 billion due to his fault.
And how did they locate him?
He became a suspect from his vacation.
“I chose only four days for the past year.
The broker who doesn’t have a vacation is a broker who doesn’t want anyone to take a look at his file,” Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has the possibility to get 365 billion
Ministers of the Government of the Czech Republic signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission yesterday from which the Czech Republic can obtain 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion crowns).
This represents almost half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
Out of seven operational programmes, approximately CZK 125 billion will be earmarked for the regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion crowns from the Enterprise and Innovation Program.
Most of the money will go to transportation, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest of the operational programmes and represents up to 22 per cent of the resources that the Czech Republic can obtain from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the state fund for transport infrastructure, which next year will have the amount of 90.8 billion crowns.
The Business and Innovation program should serve entrepreneurs and businesses for obtaining resources in business innovation.
Companies should obtain funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organizational methods.
With regard to the current use of EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the newly admitted countries that use them least.
20-Year Penalty for Former Nicaraguan President, Court Orders
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeals on Thursday imposed a 20-year sentence on former Nicaraguan President Arnaldo Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n, who was sentenced in 2003 for defamation of 100 billion dollars (almost 1.8 billion crowns).
Despite this, some time later, he was released from prison to go to house arrest on his estate not far from the Nicaraguan metropolis.
It is not clear at the moment, according to the AP agency, that the then head of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002 will again be in jail.
According to the president of the Court of Appeals, Ileana Pérez, it will rather depend on prison officers if they let the German finish his sentence at home or if they make him return to prison.
Four years ago, the court demonstrated how Germans were constantly transferring government money to the account of a company in Panama.
This society was fictitious and the account belonged, in fact, to its closest relatives and supporters.
Part of this money ended up in the fund that German created to fund his campaign in the 2001 elections.
This is how the budget was approved.
That's right.
The state budget has been approved.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first drafted by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
This year’s budget was already approved with the support of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and <0xC4><0x8C>SSD could not afford not to accept it.
Aside from several debates before the vote on the government’s confidence vote, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The Parliamentary Assembly, in this traditional but most influential view, calmly passed the new law.
It's a big paradox.
Each government starts and ends with each chapter and budget line, like it or not.
The budget is an important part of politics, but it hides the power rivalry between the government and the opposition.
It is important for the media and therefore pays special attention to it.
Political discussions are much more interesting than simple numbers.
The State Budgets of the last Social Democrat governments suffered from three flaws that for this year 2008 cannot be solved so easily:
The first of these is the high share of the mandatory laws, called as of the expenses of the presidents who are not only pensions but also social benefits that were already approved before the elections last year by the "silent" coalition of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M.
The second is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first deficit.
The third limit is the public funding deficit, such as the municipal and community budget deficit.
Despite this, the greatest risk is not in the state budget deficit.
This is public and relatively under control.
The clock pump, however, is in the deficit of the municipal and community budget.
Many mayors in order to obtain other sources of investment, apart from the tax money, fees and credits of the banks, often issued, meaningless, obligations with which they owed disproportionately to their city councils.
In recent years they managed to pay off these debts through the massive sale of energy stocks and other development networks that they received from the state and from privatization.
They do not currently have this resource.
If we stick only to the official and verified facts, we find that:
Our economy, already a few years ago, goes through growth phases in the same way as the rest of the world, of which <0xC4><0x8C>SSD boasts.
This was the ideal opportunity for his government to put order on the state’s finances.
Instead, however, the state continued to indebt.
The rest of the countries, except for some such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, saved much more reasonably than our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, above all, on the previous government.
We belong to the nations that within the global measures we are less threatened by poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programs which, unfortunately, in recent years have in vain swelled with gigantic measures.
And although they managed to eliminate some of the incomprehensible populist spending approved this year before the elections, if soon the retirement age and pension reform does not change then it will really be the end of any policy in this country and, govern who governs will only be a mere bureaucracy.
Exaggerating a little, we can say that the politicians who govern will be transformed into officials, mechanical distributors of most of the tax money for retirement and social benefits.
Therefore, this year’s budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure of normal expenditures from the expenditures of the presidents.
The planned deficit of more than 70 billion by 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary if the past government had not wasted in the last ten years what they could.
We would not want the politicians who govern to become only officials so we must be patient and grant this weak coalition of government, which realizes that the state can only spend what it is capable of getting from taxes and fees, tranquility for the preparation of other reforms of laws.
This alone will enable the gradual achievement of a balanced State Budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian central banks decided to fight together against the financial market crisis.
More than one hundred billion dollars will be received through tenders.
In these tenders, banks auction the interest rates at which they are able to lend money.
For example, the US Fed will send to bid forty billion dollars, and then another twenty-four billion will be provided by the central banks of Europe and Switzerland.
After the September 11 attacks, it is the first time that central banks from different states have agreed on this coordinated process to protect and mitigate the consequences of the financial crisis.
“This step must solve the biggest economic problem, that is, the continued growth of the free capital shortage that banks could lend,” wrote Bernard Baumohl of consulting firm Economic Outlook Group in his report to clients.
“This coordinated action by the central banks probably lowered the recession in the United States from 65 percent to fifty percent,” Baumohl said in his report.
Banks have already spent sixty billion dollars on unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Economists still expect billions in losses.
“Central banks should really be afraid of what awaits them when they decide to take this step,” said ABN Amro chief economist Kieran Davies.
“It looks like the situation is really bad,” he added.
Central banks fear that they will have the same problems of access to loans and that they will therefore have to lend more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the U.S. economy into recession with different impacts on the growth of the world economy.
The central banks thus decided, after failing to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate used for money lending in the interbank market.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to borrow money even when the central banks of the US, Canada and Britain lowered their interest rates several times during the fall.
"It will have the same effect as another interest rate drop," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some economists are not surprised that the move taken by central banks contributes to igniting the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem that is the collapse of the US real estate market.
Klaus: The debates of environmentalists are incredible
Global climate change mainly affects developing countries.
President V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus spoke again on the issue of global warming.
Criticism has now surfaced with the closure of the UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not Green Planet, he commented that the debates of environmentalists are incredible.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a strange mix of government representatives and non-governmental organizations, but the fundamental difference between the rhetoric used and reality.
“There the debates are barely structured, they are fireworks of words, substitutes for the solution to the current problems,” Klaus said.
The Czech president during the presentation of his book stressed that this issue is very important to him and that is why he is interested.
He also expressed his joy at discovering his book translated into German because, as he said, “many times I only find myself in the caricature of my ideas.”
Now interested parties can find out about their varied opinions.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist but that he has, in his opinion, enough assumptions to write a book like this.
He is academic, able to follow and judge a specialized dissertation, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
At the main moment of the closure he expressed his thought that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that on the warming of the planet there is no agreement among scientists, that the consequences of the current changes are not so great and serious, nor represent possible disasters and that attempts to influence the development of the climate are useless, ineffective and costly.
Furthermore, as a man experienced with totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous way of limiting the freedom of others.
To the questions of those present, he repeatedly explained that he is not against "reasonable environmental advocates but against environmental activists who do not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits."
Klaus spoke about the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayes Institute.
600,000 people failed to change their driver’s license
Six hundred thousand drivers were given the date and therefore did not manage to change their old driving license whose validity ends at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can apply for the change so that officials give them time until the end of the year to issue the new card.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after New Year hundreds of thousands of drivers will be on the roads without a valid card.
According to traffic, the card has not been changed mainly by those who no longer even want to drive.
While in the villages they announce a rapid decline in the change of carnets, the offices of the metropolis are full of requests and interest in the new carnet has increased.
The City Council estimates about 2,000 customers daily.
In the queues are waiting for half an hour.
In Prague, around 140,000 drivers have not yet been issued the new card.
The issuance of a new card lasts twenty days.
However, it is possible to request the issuance of the card within a shorter period of five days.
But in that case the driver has to pay five hundred crowns.
Drivers who must change their driving licence and do not reach the end of the year, but will get off the roads without a valid driving licence will risk a fine from January onwards.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
The police can fix the violation with a warning.
In the event of an administrative infringement, the fine will amount to 2,500 CZK.
According to the above information, the person who does not go anywhere could receive a fine.
They could presumably pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The ministry appealed to the offices to moderately incur fines of up to 1,000 crowns.
According to transport ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka, the fines of 1,000 crowns do not threaten anyone.
According to him, the driver’s license is a document in which people can decide whether they want it or not.
It is not the identity card that every person must have valid.
People who do not want to drive should hand over their driver’s license.
Just bring it or send it by certified mail to the municipal offices.
At the end of the year, the cards issued during the years 1964 and 1993 are no longer valid.
However, drivers will have to gradually change the other types of driving licenses.
People with the document between 1994 and 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the card issued between 2001 and 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million more documents.
Court cuts sentence for Berdych's accomplices
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k accused of complicity with the criminal David Berdych will spend between thirteen and ten years in prison.
The Prague High Court ruled that the sentences should be reduced to one year and the sentences to two years.
The detectives of the Prague department against organized crime were going to fall, at first, between 14 and 12 years old.
The decision of today can no longer be appealed, only by revocation by the High Court.
Berdych is also indicted in this case, but the verdict of the Court of First Instance awaits him in the first place.
Despite this, in other trials he has already been sentenced to a total of 16 years.
You can't get any more.
In January, the District Court acknowledged involvement in the robbery of 19 people and the Superior Court today revoked 16 of them.
Most of the defendants’ accusations were rejected by the investigation because they were fabricated causes.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, police members in agreement with Berdych passed information from police sources to the criminals, covered up the robberies, and helped criminal group members avoid punishment.
These criminals handed over 30 percent of their theft to Opava and Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k.
The indictment refers to the criminal acts carried out by the group between 1999 and 2001.
As for the robbery, their victims suffered serious health impacts but are also accused of abuse of power as public agents and without weapons permission.
In the home registry, police found pistols, steel-core ammunition, a laser conductor, and a machine gun.
The group of criminals, according to the indictment, stole tens of millions of crowns from them.
With the exception of nearly twenty men in this trial, the court has already found Berdych and other defendants guilty.
Other men related to the Berdych case are still testifying of other processes, and in some cases have not yet appeared.
Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> P<0xC5><0xAF>t and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej, who have so far avoided trial, are in prison in Ireland where they await the final decision on their handover to the authorities of the Czech Republic.
One account for changing some children: 12 million
For changing children in the maternity home the lawyer of the affected families, Igor Veleba, wants from the hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>ebi<0xC4><0x8D> 12 million crowns in compensation plus the costs of the trial.
For each of the mothers, three million, for the parents, two million, and for the children, one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 per parent.
The hospital’s legal representative, Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l, is not in principle in agreement with Veleba’s proposal.
"We do not approve of such a demand, it is too high," Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l said after today's meeting.
“In order to get an idea of this counter-proposal, we need the report of the specialist that the counterparty ordered to investigate.
We'll find out if it's of rescission value.
We remain in the opinion that there will be hundreds of thousands for everyone," Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l said.
The amount should move between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each parent.
At the beginning of the case, the Jablo<0xC5><0x88> family wanted, for each month that they did not raise their biological daughter, one million crowns.
Velaba served as the basis for negotiating compensation for the specialist's report, except that it was prepared at the Motol Faculty Hospital in Prague.
The parents of the girls, according to specialists in psychology and psychiatry, suffered from psychic impact and stress of different levels and depth.
The stress situation was better endured by the men although they struggled with recriminations for the change of the girls.
Women are worse off with the trauma they are currently experiencing and with regard to what is happening today, Veleba added.
Veronica and Nicola were exchanged by the nurses at the T<0xC5><0x99>ebi<0xC4><0x8D> maternity home last year, on December 9.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola a los <0xC4><0x8C>erm<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xBD> a P<0xC5><0x99>ibyslavic, and Ver<0xC3><0xB3>nica a Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jablo<0xC5><0x88>.
In late October, Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina Governor Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Vystr<0xC4><0x8D>il handed over 100,000 crowns to each family as compensation for the mistake made at the hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>ebi<0xC4><0x8D> that the region administers.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law as liability for damages.
In case of errors they must withdraw from the reserve fund and extraordinarily can ask for help from the administrator.
The court up to today recognized them with a proportionally low compensation, the sums that were calculated according to the tables that count in hundreds of thousands and extraordinarily one million crowns.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka lost the kingdom of Wallachia
Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka lost the lawsuit over the brand Kingdom of Wallachia.
According to the judge of the provincial court of Ostrava was the first to use the brand Kingdom of Wallachia but the project was created for many years by Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> with whom the actor collaborated.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka did not appear at the oral hearing today.
According to your lawyer, the case is probably not over and your client will appeal.
"The lawsuit is that Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team are parasites of Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka's popularity," Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka's lawyer said after the trial.
For him, before the words Kingdom of Wallachia, everyone gets the image of the actor and comedian.
Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> has the same idea.
“We’ve been behind us for about 10 years.
Search for money and invention of activities," he said.
For him, the cause of the lawsuit is money.
“After years I have realized that the project is successful and that it could also receive something.
They want to live as parasites of our work,” he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, the brand Kingdom of Wallachia was first used by Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka in his TV show.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohat<0xC3><0xBD>.
Then it was not a question of orienting him towards the creation of a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> came up with the idea of editing the passport of the Kingdom of Wallachia.
From that comic origin resulted a business and a lucrative business activity from which Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> then created the society Kingdom of Wallachia.
In 1997, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka agreed on the use of his name and signature on passports and even offered his owners discounts to visitors to his farm and attendees to his shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also determined today that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> only used a simple idea that Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka made public on stage for his own business benefit.
"It is clear that Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Wallachia," the judge said.
He added, however, that in the spirit of the project is Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team who devoted themselves completely to it.
The collaboration, between the now decomposed parts, continued until 2000 when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized for Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka the official coronation in Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n.
From that moment on, conflicts began to arise between Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, the culmination of which came with the overthrow of "King Boles<0xC5><0x82>aw I, the elect forever".
The leading role in the kingdom, through Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, was derived from singer Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>ul<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, as queen mother.
In 2002, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka filed an indictment against Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his society, which to this day has been rejected by the court.
Something clear could bring in the litigation, the tournament for the throne with their princesses, which is already preparing Harabi<0xC5><0x9F>.
The new king should come out of him.
He did not want to reveal any more data or dates.
“We are in no hurry.
It would have to be something like the king's way to Moravia.
The king would have to be elected on a specific date.
Even Mr. Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka can show up," Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: prejudices overcome
I’ve never really liked the Peugeot 206.
Its running characteristics were never anything special, the quality of the gearbox, maneuver and also the product could be characterized as below average.
But now its successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and this one is much better.
This Combi called SW is a little more advanced and to me, I just have to think about it better.
When I tried the classic five-door Peugeot 207, I complained, for example, about the headroom in the rear seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the body of the Combi means in this sense, that I will not suffer from the two meters in length.
Flying around the world
Step inside quickly so as not to repeat it too much.
It is an elegant design where the only flaw is the poor central tunnel.
Here I would appreciate the design invention more even though the car already looks quite elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are the times when we complained about short seats and backrests.
Also unlike the model 206, the lateral direction has improved considerably.
And space?, and here you can feel how the body measurements have grown.
In the Combi, the aforementioned lack of space in the headboard disappears.
Suitcases to the trunk
But the main thing in this vehicle is its trunk.
This should be valued as very accessible (thanks to the folding rear door) and a well-distributed storage.
Dead spaces are equipped with rubber straps that provide an ideal solution.
They do not bother, and can extend to the point of holding heavy objects.
But let's stay in the warehouse.
According to the tables, in a basic regime it has a capacity of 428 liters which compared to the competition is rather an average value.
But not in comparison with the best-selling vehicle of the same type in the Czech Republic, the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> Boleslav model, we find out that the Peugeot is behind with its noticeable 52 liters.
On holiday abroad or when placing the stroller of the child its value is critical.
But if I had to comment on something positive then I must quote the floor that remains quite flat after knocking down the backs of the second line.
120 horses in four gears
Our tested car was equipped with a four-valve injection ignition over a capacity of 1.6 l. and a force of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, that's what a 1600 should look like that would disdain the familiar five doors.
It is quiet, consumes little and, above all, has momentum.
If I compare it to the time of the pangs of the time that it seemed as if the exhaust pipe was plugged by a cloth, I can say that with this I can be impressed.
The prices respond
The price of the car is not for all pockets.
We must, however, bear in mind that we have tested an elegantly equipped vehicle with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with injection ignition of 1400 for 329,900 crowns, can still be.
Our aggregates put it from 410,900 crowns, which is already too much.
The Premium type tested already reaches another 80,000 crowns.
Only we would still have airbag in the headlights, automatic air conditioning, automatic wiper blades, automated rear windows...
That is, the car with all of it, costs 531,900 crowns.
It’s a lot, but count on the team’s additions to the Fabia and you’ll get to a pretty similar number.
Now it remains only to decide which of the two brands.
Slovak students do not integrate into English schools
In English schools, children from Eastern European countries attend and so locals fear more changes in schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans for now brings only a number of problems.
Even British schools record those cases where conflicts between immigrants and native children increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of Eastern European children in British schools is very well illustrated in the northern city of Kent, where conflicts between Slovak natives and emigrants begin to grow.
Discussions, extortion, and brawls among students have already reached even the parents themselves.
The situation has come so far that Chatmam police arrested a Slovak woman who was beating a ten-year-old student with a green stick.
In her defense, she said the girl was insulting her son with racist insults.
Police also had to act after an attack by two underage girls on a Slovak migrant.
The girls taunted him with racist insults and threw stones at him.
“When we were going home, a boy approached us at the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to leave, he made us the urge to throw apples and pears at us, and then he took off his pants and showed us his ass," he described another unpleasant incident for The Times, the mother of the Slovak student.
Complaints are on both sides.
One of the natives even designated the conflict with migrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases already mentioned above, show us how the environment in English schools is starting to be quite tense.
In Britain there are 70,000 registered Slovaks who came here for work reasons.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors it is really the island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your vacation can come true, as long as you choose correctly.
Sandy and golden beaches, great waves or a calm sea like a pond.
the palm trees and the all-inclusive with waiters offering pizzas on the beach, ice cream or varied cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the island of the Caribbean Sea you can find all this and much more.
Only on one island can you find much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the islands of the Greater Antilles.
In the time of the Spaniards, Cuba became the bastion of the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and cargo port for the treasures that the Spaniards extracted from America and brought to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The National Hotel grew in the late 1920s.
He ordered it to be built by one of the chiefs of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, as everything about crime in the US (and therefore prohibited) was welcomed and supported in Cuba as drugs, gambling and prostitution.
Among his guests were, among other things,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, tall buildings emerged, along wide avenues ran cars that were a symbol of worship in the 50s of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought an estate in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojimar had his yacht.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, the stars of the show world and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
What about today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita Ab<0xC3><0xA1>nense you can also leave your autograph.
In the bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional, cocktails are mixed according to your wishes.
And those cars already cult of the 50s, to this day they continue to operate in Havana, because those Lada and Fiat that arrived long ago have rusted between these wet and salty winds.
Even though Havana, especially the old quarter, is deteriorating noticeably, there are not as many wonderful colonial monuments around as there.
Other places are metamorphosed in beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings so much necessary money, its development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holgu<0xC3><0xAD>n and in islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is unique in the world and that is highly valued by railway lovers.
The sugar cane is transported from the immense plantations to the sugar factories by narrow lanes in steam or electric machines.
Their coaches for decades were not discovered and now they are there, machines that work and whose sibling models that exist in other parts of the world are only found in museums.
Where to go?
The most well-known place for most visitors does not change.
And so, it is not necessary to talk more about Havana or Varadero.
Perhaps, just remember that in the already mentioned Hemingway estate there is a museum that for those who are lovers of the writer, should not fail to visit it.
The Vi<0xC3><0xB1>ales Valley is the most picturesque corner of Cuba to the west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation growing on limestone soils.
Mogots, pillars of limestone rock and rocks of elevated steepness in the valley falls, and in their caves acclimatize fertile lands thanks to which rocks are formed that hide dense vegetation.
The valley is the place where probably the highest quality tobacco is grown in Cuba.
By visiting one of the Havana cigar factories you can find your final product.
Perhaps someone finds it interesting that the Chilean part of the series, Major Zeman, was filmed there.
Trinidad (disambiguation)
Old town of Abolengo that was founded not long after the Spaniards colonized the island.
Slavery and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
Wealth became beauty with the constructions in the small town.
The Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by the later French settlers, has barely changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Sierra de Escambray, is a place so secluded that still in the 50s of the last century there was no road that connected it with the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her to stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built and therefore nothing was destroyed, for every person was happy to have a place to live.
If you have more time to stay in Trinidad than a single afternoon, it is worth knowing interesting places in the surrounding area such as Ancon Beach or the sugar factory valley.
The night belongs to the Casa de la M<0xC3><0xBA>sica, which animates with its music the silence of the mornings.
Baracoa
A small town on the western end of Cuba, some consider it to be the most beautiful on the island.
This view is certainly already confirmed by the way.
The two roads that reach there from Guantanamo must pass through high and broken mountains, as well as through a nature that barely knows the action of man.
This eastern place of Cuba has been inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO thanks to its intact nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the cross of Columbus (in fact it is a cross that arrived 100 years later from the landing) and from the hill, where the castle was located and now there is a hotel with the same name, you can see the mountains and among them the most famous, the Yunque.
Coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Pinos, the Cabaret Tropicana, the patron saint of Cuba, the Virgin of Charity of Copper, the Santer<0xC3><0xAD>a, African religion practiced by the descendants of those slaves, of all this could be filled many pages.
However, as they say, it's best to see it sometime.
Allies are passive in Afghanistan, Americans say
Few soldiers and insufficient equipment are influencing the progress of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates, should design a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not working as expected, representatives of countries with troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh (Scotland).
At the same time that conflicts with the Taliban are growing, today the eight participating states are discussing the plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States this week through its defense minister, Robert Gates, encouraged NATO forces to step up activity, Britain sees strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and the distribution of development aid as a priority.
“Development in Afghanistan is palpable but the armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The next is to enable the population that they alone can start economic and security development," Defence Minister Des Browne told BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of Afghan rebels, according to U.S. military data, is higher than in the last five years.
The number of violent actions increased compared to last year by 27 percent, and in Helmand province up to 60 percent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, a quarter of which are in the south of the territory.
However, for the United States, the allies have reached the same limit in terms of organization and equipment of the units.
They are exactly asking for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
“We will have to think seriously about concrete goals for the future and how we will achieve them,” Gates said.
In a similar sense, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop also spoke today.
“I’m not happy to know what we have on earth and in the sky in Afghanistan.
We have ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that’s little,” De Hoop told Reuters at the close of the three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the countries attending in recent months, there is a controversy over whether all allies are doing their best in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, was criticized for liability.
"The Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are in an area of minimal violence and the fighting demands there are not as high as ours, in the southern and eastern part of the country,” Gates said.
The sensationalist newspaper Sun this week called the German soldiers vague.
"Afghan rebels discover that the Germans are engaged in playing while our boys are fighting," Sun wrote in a video accompanying photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild responded to the attack and posted a photograph where the British troops were playing a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
The state debt will reach a trillion in 2009
For every Czech the state owes 84,000 crowns.
Total debt in September amounted to 842.7 billion crowns.
This year the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns.
However, at the beginning of December the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns thanks to the improvement of the economy of the state budget.
The state debt of the Czech Republic grew at the end of September to 842.7 billion crowns.
In nine months of this year it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
However, since June, it has decreased 13.4 billion crowns.
So today, the Ministry of Economy confirmed its data on the state debt of early October.
For each Czech, the debt corresponds to 84,000 crowns.
For the whole last year, the state borrowed more than 111 million crowns.
“For now, it seems that thanks to next year’s low deficit we could cross the billion-crown border until 2009.
Next year the debt should move between 900 billion and a trillion crowns," David Marek, economist at Patria Finance, told iHNed.cz.
Next Finance economist Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Pikora said: “We could spend a billion in 2009.
Exactly when that will depend on the next budget we still don’t know.
If the situation on the political scene was seen to change and politicians were able to save, then it could be delayed to 2010.
But I don’t see such a change,” he added.
Doubt grows
The debt of the state creates debts in the central government and arises, above all, from the accumulation of the deficit of the state budget.
The debt of the state is paid by means of treasury bonds, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state’s domestic debt grew this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The external debt for now has grown from 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
The so-called negotiable state debt at the end of September contained 803.3 billion z crowns since June fell by 13.7 billion z crowns.
The average maturity of government debt increased by 6.5 years.
“The total year-on-year debt from the first to the third quarter creates 13 percent which is huge given how the economy works.
Interestingly, growth is mainly generated from bonds where there is a 20 percent growth.
It is bad that the debt grows but on the other hand it shows that it is going to be negotiated until there is a pension reform," Pikora said.
Better than expected.
From the strategy of payments and debt management of the state for the year 2007 is extracted that the government planned this year to lend 159.2 billion crowns.
At the beginning of December, the ministry reduced the plan by 152.8 billion crowns thanks to the improvement of the state budget.
The amount is mainly composed of the state budget deficit that this year will be 76 million crowns instead of the planned 91.3 billion crowns.
The remainder is composed of maximum resources planned for the Czech Consolidation Agency with about CZK 13.3 billion, the reserve of CZK 10 billion for the payment of pensions, CZK 43 billion to finance the obligations of the state and CZK 1.8 billion in payments of loans from the European Investment Bank.
I compared Khartoum today in court for giving a name to a teddy bear
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insulting Islam has been sentenced Thursday afternoon by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and expulsion, her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of letting 6- to 7-year-olds give the name Mohammed to a teddy bear when any representation of the Prophet of Islam is illegal.
He was liable to a penalty of flogging.
The 54-year-old British schoolteacher from the Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, has been detained at her home on Sunday and charged with assaulting Islam and sedition under article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, following several complaints by parents of pupils to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually goes back to the month of September, when this teacher asks her pupils, 6/7 years old, to choose a name for the teddy bear of the class.
"Eight names come out of the mouths of children, such as Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a class vote, 20 children out of 23 have chosen Mohamed as their preferred name.
Mohammed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children made a book for the class with the photo of the bear with the following legend "My name is Mohamed".
The bear himself did not bear any labels with this name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons’ Muslim colleagues, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, said he knew her well and would never have done anything that might be offensive to a religious faith, “I’m sorry just that I asked the children to vote for a name,” he said.
An opinion shared by numerous pupils of the schoolteacher who describe her as "very attentive to her pupils " and " never talking about religion in class ".
Remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Britain, it is written in English with 14 different modes.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
Can we give it to a toy, for example?
This is, of course, a matter of interpretation.
They have not reached an agreement on Wednesday on the future status of the province, during the last negotiation session in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
Kosovo Serbs and Albanians on Wednesday morning concluded a sixth and final session of discussions in Baden, Austria, without being able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the statute," European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
Emphasizing that peace in the region was " at stake " , his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
“We don’t anticipate violence for now but we are entering a very difficult period,” he added, noting that “obvious tensions exist.”
End of mediation on 10 December
The mediators of the troika, which regroups the European Union, the United States and Russia, will go to Serbia and Kosovo one last time on Monday.
The future of the province populated by 90% of Albanians could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko return their relationship to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, constituted the sixth and final session of negotiations since the troika was tasked with a new UN mediation last August.
Americans and Europeans believe their mediation will end on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence in Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on a continuation of the negotiations beyond this deadline.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," Botsane-Khartchenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of UN administration in Kosovo, Westerners consider independence under the supervision of the European Union to be the only viable solution.
Pristina is prepared to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not resolve in its favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no deal has been found," Kosovo Autonomous Authority President Fatmir Sejdiu announced at the Baden hotel where these "last-chance negotiations" were held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province, has given part of his regrets.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "belonged to a past that has led to murders and deportations".
" Domino Effect "
Serbian President Boris Tadic has said a compromise was always feasible, warning Kosovo’s Albanian majority against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of independence.
Belgrade says it particularly fears a " domino effect " in a region still weakened by the independence wars of the 1990s.
"For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision should belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has a veto right.
" The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word "
"Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica had said.
"These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must end as they have begun: in the Security Council. "
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that " the Kosovo Parliament will have the final say on the status " , adding that any unilateral declaration of independence on the part of the Albanians would be made " in consultation " with the Westerners.
Bush launches agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, during the opening of the international peace conference he met in Annapolis, Maryland, on Tuesday, that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He noted that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately enter into negotiations with a view to finding a definitive regulation of the 60-year-old litigation point between their two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a “peace treaty” before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must dismantle “terrorist infrastructure” and Israel must end its colonization activities, Bush said, recalling both sides’ obligations to the peace itinerary they agreed to in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would attempt "to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues."
This denomination covers the three main troubled issues of the contentious point between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the US president, Abbas insisted that the upcoming negotiations be “global and in-depth” and refer to all aspects of a regulation, citing “Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things.”
On his return to the podium, Olmert pledged to make the upcoming negotiations "direct and continuous" and to make "an effort to conclude them in the course of 2008".
Bush set the end of 2008 for the implementation of his " two-state " vision of Palestinian and Israeli coexisting.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had achieved a commitment in this regard on the part of Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, that proposes to Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks “a point of confrontation in the history of the Middle East, more particularly because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects,” Prince Saud said in his Arab newspaper interview with Saudi capitals.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened last Sunday?
Just as every time in this kind of events, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the General Inspectorate of the French National Police (IGPN), a police car was circulating on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., Luisa-Miguel Street, in Villiers-le-Bel.
"It was not in intervention but on patrol, and was traveling at 40-50 km/h, without a rotary headlight," explains a police source.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, " not approved, i.e. not authorized to drive on the public road " (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, circulated " all-gas " .
"He hit the police car on the left side, after a breach of the cede the step to the right," the police said.
The control of alcoholemia practiced on the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
The condition of the car (the front collapsed, windshield cracked, bumper torn) testifies to the violence of the crash.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the procurator of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thér<0xC3><0xA8>re de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation for " acts of involuntary homicide and denial of assistance " to the IPPN, cocooned with the Department of Public Safety of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor states that the investigation of the IPPN, at this stadium, ruled out the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, understood on Sunday afternoon, confirmed "the version of the police, namely that this mini-motorcycle arrived relatively quickly to his left."
Yesterday, a type of slot, undoubtedly caused by the rubbing of the shoes on the ground, showed that both vehicles had been stuck in time for the police car to brake.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to technical examination.
The bodies of both victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after that?
Yesterday, a rumor circulated quickly in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police would have left the site very quickly, thus not lending help to both young men.
The IPPN, being prudent, would also remove " any serious wrongdoing " on this point.
"It's the most difficult aspect of the investigation, which needs more investigation, which you have to be very careful about," a police source said.
Liberation found an eyewitness to these few moments that have followed the accident.
One of his windows that just looks at the scene.
"We immediately went down, with my cousin who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to resuscitate them," this witness said.
There was nothing to do."
Then he saw "a completely terrified policeman, who stabbed.
Two others were trying to resuscitate one of the young men, the fourth was talking on the phone.”
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, it seems, to the certainty that people were present from the unexpected situation of the young, the police officers have been taken by car by colleagues who had arrived at the site.
According to this witness, the rescue arrived "about twenty minutes after the police's departure."
They also practiced heart massages, in vain.
" I will not presume that the police services did not bring assistance to the young people.
These young people have been rescued.
The firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything has been done to try to save them,” the prosecutor said.
Tension Rises in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday suppressed the first demonstrations since the establishment of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the eastern city of Lahore, nearly 2,000 lawyers protesting against state-of-the-art measures have been injured by tear grenades used by law enforcement, according to witnesses.
The latter responded with stone shots, wounding police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been interviewed.
Scenes similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police charged and injured lawyers.
Many would have been interrogated.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers called for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of a wave of some 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets that gave access to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning to prevent the grouping.
Other demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (centre) and in Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers’ movement on Monday gathered the support of the religious parties regrouped in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president “calls on the people to send flowers to the judges who spoke out against the state of emergency and the waste they swore an oath to in front of Musharraf.”
" Musharraf's Promise No Longer Fulfills "
The Pakistani Supreme Court refers directly to the measure of exception proclaimed on Saturday afternoon.
He had to speak in the coming days about the legality of re-election to the presidential elections on October 6, in the indirect election of President Musharraf.
The president of the court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been removed and replaced.
“Everything we attend is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court’s rulings,” the magistrate told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army and become a civilian president "no longer values" after the establishment of the state of emergency, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to leave his military uniform by November 15, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Assistant Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government denied insistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf had been assigned to reside by his deputy chief of armies.
More than a third of pregnancies remain unpredictable
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as ill-planned or unexpected births.
Even today, more than one in three (36%) pregnancies are not expected, a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined) reveals, forty years after the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as ill-planned or unexpected births.
Different methods of contraception such as the pill or the sterile still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, Ined estimates.
The liberalization of contraception, however, allowed for a better “dominance of fertility,” according to the institute noting that the rate of pill use among women aged 20 to 44 has gone from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight births out of ten would be well planned today.
Even calculated little more or less a month for a couple out of five and if possible for spring, season judged as the most enjoyable to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It will have taken astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates from the International Space Station (ISS) more than seven hours of space work to perform the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel that is indispensable for the continuation of the station’s scientific activities.
A risky exit that accumulated the records because of its duration, its distance from the habitable modules, the speed with which it has been imagined, instruments "chapouted" by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday when the astronauts had released from the Discovery shuttle the Harmony module, a thick cylindrical piece in charge of soon hosting the European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a type of landing gear for laboratory modules.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was to move an electricity production module with solar panels weighing 17.5 tons, already present on the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After moving it, the crew began reorganizing the solar panels of the module that have a span of 76 meters.
And it is where one of the panels, which unfold as accordions, has been damaged in little more than a meter or less by a cable that has been buckled.
The deployment has been stopped to prevent further damage to the panel.
The astronauts, who initially had to make a control exit from the Discovery shuttle, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged panel.
And it is Scott Parazynski who has been chosen to go snailing at the end of the 30-metre-long remote control arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to carry out the repair.
It is one of NASA’s best spacewalkers.
High, sturdy, very skilled, has a very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training doctor has been commissioned to "operate" the "injured" solar panel.
After precisely inspecting the damage, he cut the faulty cable and installed types of "boards" in the damaged area.
He had been helped by the second " spacewalker " who had stayed close to the airlock and, from the inside, by other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, an insulator-wrapped mini-hockey stick to prevent electrocution on solar panels that produced several hundred volts, has been conceived and "chapouted" by the astronauts aboard the station.
After the operation was over, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before taking stock of his instruments and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts took advantage of a noon break before today, seven astronauts return from the Discovery shuttle for the return to Earth scheduled for Wednesday.
EADS Title Sanctioned on Stock Exchange
EADS stock is currently in sharp decline on the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aeronautics and defense group has announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to cope with the delays of the A400M.
EADS loses 4% to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>21.96 currently on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group has been forced to revise its 2007 operating result forecast in response to delays caused by the slow progression of the A400M engine development, which conditioned the aircraft's inaugural flight.
The cost to alleviate the delay in the delivery of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, amounts to "between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than 1 billion for Airbus," the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS announced.
Due to these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new operating result (EBIT) targets for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, it adds without any further ciphering.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
It should be recalled that the operating result of EADS failed by 86 % in 2006, mainly due to loads linked to the delays of another programme, that of the very large A380 carrier.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The Choice of the Status Quo
No surprise on Sunday, at the polls: the Russians are going to massively opt for President Putin’s party, united Russia.
Confirming his aspiration for stability, including authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
Three days before the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin sends a televised message to voters about public broadcasts, already recorded but the contents of which are kept secret.
He does so as a list leader for the united Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory proves overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president left nothing to be transparent about welcoming foreign ambassadors, contenting himself with handing over a new charge against the West accused of meddling – his theme of predilection during the campaign.
“We know the price of true democracy and we want honest, more transparent and more open elections, elections without incidents,” he added.
According to the opposition, we are far from the truth.
He denounces a campaign mangled by pressure.
Communist leader Gennadi Ziouganov says there has never been "never been such a dirty election, even in the time of Yeltsin".
After the crackdown on demonstrations last weekend, former world champion chess player Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstrations, is banned from visiting, according to his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the mentality of the Soviet homo"
Behind these surprise legislative elections are two much more open-ended questions:
Who will succeed Putin in the presidency?
The official newspaper published the date of the first round of the presidential election on 2 March 2008; candidates have until 23 December to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for a third consecutive term.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will Putin play after March?
The Prime Minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and the very powerful united Russia party that would elect the government and the president?
Whatever it is, at both legislative and presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians kept the homo sovieticus mentality, they do not feel that they own their destiny," said sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University goes back further: civil society lagged behind in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Poutine restored the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population since this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic outpouring," said Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians " voluntarily renounce the personal responsibility " of those who had briefly proved themselves after the outbreak of the USSR.
"Why reflect?"
The phenomenon affects all social strata, including the world of affairs.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of united Russia.
New freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
Opinion prefers stability.
In the name of that the Russians will not vote for extremists either.
Conclusion of Tamara Cherednitchenko, 54-year-old teacher: " Why reflect?
Those in power aren’t too bad, why change them?”
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of secrecy, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which describe the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are freely accessible.
The 47 million archive documents, stored over 27 km of shelves in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were not so far available only for a "humanitarian" purpose, that is, individually and nominally, at the request of a former victim or her rights holders.
The eleven states in charge of its management - such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to seekers and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
Historians’ access to Bad Arolsen will allow searches “particularly on the displacements of prisoners, the population of the camps and the health status of forced laborers,” explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Commission of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, such as Germany, objected to the opening to the public of these nominative documents, because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
As well as the alleged homosexuality or mental handicap of certain victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or detention orders established by the Gestapo had been gathered after the war for a practical purpose: to find the citizens deported or subjected to compulsory work and, eventually, to provide them with proof of their internment, in order to open the way to their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees deal with tens of thousands of individual petitions.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to be expected from these documents," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Research Center on Antisemitism at the Technische Universität Berlin in 2006.
The European Union and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, Indo-European bilateral trade already reaches about 60 billion euros per year.
The European Union is India’s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
The European Union’s foreign ministers had given their approval to the European Commission last April to start negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), with Indo-European bilateral trade already reaching around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion a year.
The European Union is India’s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
LUE is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th trading partner of the European Union, according to figures from the European Commission.
“A free-trade pact will greatly boost both economies” and “India would improve its entry into a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans,” said Peter Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, said the European Commissioner. The Asian and European giants change annually for "47 billion euros of goods " and for " ten billion euros of services ", said this week Dani<0xC3><0xA8>le Smadja, head of the European Commission's delegation to the European Union.

The Bank of England takes note of concerns by offering <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion in five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday was concerned about easing the current turnaround from concerns about credit conditions, and announced a <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion offer at the 5.75% base rate in five weeks, an offer of unusual duration.
" To alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty about how they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its expected reserve contribution during the five-week open-market maintenance period beginning on December 6 in the form of an operation.
The bank specifies that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put on the market thus on December 6 at 12h 15 GMT, at the base index and until January 10.
It is the first time it seems that the Bank of England BoE puts liquidity on the market for five weeks in an open market operation.
These are usually done in a week.
The BoE adds in its statement that it is " prepared to take further steps to keep the interbank lending indices " up to date in line with its base index.
The interbank index per day was 5.829 percent on Wednesday.
The index after three months stood at 6.6%, the highest since September 18.
Since the start of the summer financial crisis, the sums put on the market by the Bank of England were combined to a significant penalty rate that had deterred banks from resorting to that.
According to certain rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the change in the pound against the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the amounts brought to the market by the European Central Bank, to the most advantageous indices and with a more assured discretion.
The UMP and NC parties deny consideration of the PS party’s proposals on purchasing power
The UMP group and Nouveau Centre on Thursday refused to discuss articles of the socialist law proposal on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
Inscribed in a socialist "niche" (session for the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the national office of the PS, among which the increase of 50% of the bonus for employment, the restoration of the floating TIPP (internal rate for petroleum products), a check-transport or rent restrictions.
Since UMP and NC have voted against the review of the articles (180 votes to 115), the session has been lifted at the end of the general discussion that resulted in exchanges, sometimes live, between the majority and opposition a few hours after Nicolas Sarkozy’s televised intervention on purchasing power.
PS leader Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of his proposals in the form of amendments to the amending finance bill examined by the Assembly next week.
A new festival comes to light
As a result of numerous rumors regarding the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
“For our company, it’s an honor to work with a person who inspired, no more and no less, the current festival movement in America,” Charlie Jones of C3 told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer camping destination.
The festival would take place from August 8 to 10 on a private 500-acre farm approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, Festival Republic director Melvin Benn is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took over the management of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which annually attracts about 80,000 people.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio then in 2006, the Republic Festival created the Henham Park Latitude Festival in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as a co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizing of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury as the “most inspiring event” he has ever attended, C3’s Charlie Jones says his company and Melvin Benn’s are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
“We had chosen Philadelphia as the market and worked with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia,” says Charlie Jones.
“We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about this project.
“Unfortunately, we are stuck in low-level politics because of the current administration.
“Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and prepare to create a magnificent festival at an exceptional venue that will, lately, take place in Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Chicago's Grant Park, after having broken out in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M respectively in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a country festival, while ours are rather held in urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
The goal is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to give at once an impression of a country festival in the European way and an urban one in the American way.”
Vineland is roughly halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the celebration of this event,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but states "that they are quite interesting to allow to invest in such an event and host a festival that, hopefully, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the festival’s hotel offering is “very large,” like the 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that invitations have been sent to the groups, but that nothing could yet be confirmed at the time of going under the press.
“Vineland will have the taste of rock, but the music will be varied there, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators,” says Charlie Jones.
His C3 teammates, who received the Top Independent Promoter award from the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces Terminator
It’s not easy to attract Hollywood movie dishes to Montreal when nothing but Terminator opposes that...
This mission of seduction is part of the functions of delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger denounces "runaway productions".
Is it hard to compete with the "Governor"?
“You have to be careful, it’s the industry that decides where to go.
If you find that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, you will go there.
Our role is to offer those who will judge the best,” he says.
The race to festivals
For now, Denis Turcotte’s priority is nevertheless to promote the cinema here.
The Oscars race has begun.
All West Coast festivals, whether Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to present the Quebec films, give them value and make sure the filmmakers do interviews.
The Age of Darkness had a good image at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on the billboard in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally on the stock market? The experts, divided by the 'subprime' crisis.
Less than five weeks before the end of the exercise, investors are already rubbing their hands in anticipation of the traditional end-of-year rally.
However, this year the experts are not so clear that this is going to be produced.
Banif believes that “from a statistical point of view, the month of December on the stock market usually has a positive behavior.
However, forecasts should not be made solely on the basis of statistics, especially since in the current context, uncertainties lurk in the markets, at least in the short term.
Although they are not in favour of the stock market picking up in the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is supported by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of flight towards quality values both in long and short tranches."
Therefore, they believe that the stock market will behave rather sideways, not exempt from volatility "especially because the impact of the likely decline in Fed rates is not known, given the high level of crude and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions."
Javier Barrio, BPI’s sales manager in Spain, agrees that this is not a good time to venture to say that there is going to be a rally.
“It’s not the thing for many joys,” the expert says.
The Ibex has lost about 4% since its peaks on November 8 when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
Yet not all experts have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year closer to 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of the portfolios and the traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year on these dates.
However, the expert notes that things will be a bit different this year as he believes the rally will advance to the second week of December, after the Constitution Bridge.
The analyst does not consider that volatility is going to affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, analyst at Inversis Bank, appreciates that we are close to technical levels and "we could therefore see a rebound in the index that could be driven depending on the news that comes from the US regarding the consequences of the crisis in the credit market."
The analyst is confident that these are positive.
Analysts agree when choosing the values that will be in charge of bringing Ibex to new maximum quotas.
Solana, of Intermoney, says that "this year it's up to the big values."
The expert would include in the portfolio the two major banks and some construction companies "because when the date comes, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha, of Inversi Banco, says the rises will come from the bank and the industrial sector.
The builders will also be able to benefit from this rally, if given.
“ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other builders such as Ferrovial and FCC will continue on the same path,” explains the expert.
The cyclical consumption will be the protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology will also do very well, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has been a bearish month on only two occasions.
The real end-of-year rally took place in 2003, a year in which stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the bursting of the technology bubble.
This year, in which the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December recorded a rebound of 6.68%.
It will have to be seen if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of earnings (for the moment the Ibex rises by 8.36% since January) and if it manages to count on its year-end rally.
People will open 200 offices 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
People have decided to renovate much of their offices.
A total of 200, located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a big change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish entities, as it is the first group that decides to take the leap to bet on the uninterrupted opening of their agencies until 20.30 in the afternoon, and open on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 20.30 in the afternoon.
Another group that has also reiterated on several occasions that it wanted to expand the schedules of its branches, BBVA, has not yet decided to take the step.
Meanwhile, it is about to close a deal with unions to close 75% of their offices on Saturdays in exchange for opening one afternoon, though not to the public.
The results of the experience of Popular will be decisive for other entities to sign up or not to this initiative that supports the hours of the shops.
This is precisely the goal that Popular pursues with the project.
Capture private customers who move through these areas to make their purchases, to SMEs, self-employed and shops in the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 offices open throughout Spain in about 18 months, as they are not new openings but remodeling of existing ones.
To this end, the entity will modernize the branches it already has in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile presented by customers in the different streets.
In this way, the expansion of the schedules is accompanied by a different conception of the space of the branch and a new design, more current, with brighter colors.
The head of commercial banking, <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera, says that this restructuring does not involve a large investment, albeit a larger recruitment of staff, since it goes from having about six employees per premises to eight or nine.
The offices, which will even have spaces for SMEs to gather there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its initiative in three offices in Madrid.
And the experience has been positive, as <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivero explains.
The branches on the streets of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a de Madrid have been chosen, and it seems that with success, according to Rivero.
Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 operating under the brand Mundocredit, specializing in immigrants, also with very wide schedules, which even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these locations PopularMax will not repeat the model of BBVA, where several of its offices have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
“We don’t want to compete with our customers,” says Rivero.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica to sell mobile phones, with staff outside the bank.
Telecinco doubles the value of its rival Antena 3 for the first time
We've got it."
With that phrase he expressed his satisfaction yesterday Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, at the closing of the market, when he found that the chain he leads doubled the value of its rival, Antena 3.
Only one aspect clouded his joy: ‘It hurts me, it’s not because we’ve grown more but because we’ve gone down less,’ he said.
Still, he emphasized that in a weak market, ‘we’ve fallen less.’
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with an advance of 2.54%.
That gain puts its loss in what we have this year at 15.66%.
The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and owned by Vocento (another 13%) thus reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to data from Bloomberg.
Its rival Antena 3, which yesterday yielded 1.52% and accumulates a 40.5% drop since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communication companies amounts to 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518.53 million Prisa (editor of Five Days) and 1.779 million Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is because 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do, in the same market, at what cost and how we make it profitable in terms of audience.
Telecinco announced last week that it expects to become this year’s first television channel to exceed 1 billion gross advertising revenues, according to Giuseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespa<0xC3><0xB1>a, the subsidiary that manages the group’s advertising.
If this announced data were made real, the television network would register this year an increase of 3.6% in its advertising turnover compared to the 965.4 million in 2006.
For its part, the net turnover of Antena 3 increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (up to 734.4 million) while net revenue from television grew by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point out for the best relative evolution in Telecinco Stock Exchange is the high payout it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company headed by Alejandro Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile says that although it is early to make the decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol in association with its parent company Mediaset.
"We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always stated much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to make our shareholders happy, who we have already valued with 33% of Endemol’.
According to analysts, the market gives samples at these times of some fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates on Telecinco by 4% in 2008 and by 7% in 2009.
It is due, they explain, to the fact that the projected income growth has been reduced from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same firm has lowered Antena 3’s profit forecast by 4.5% in 2008 and by 7.5% in 2009.

The Congress approves the transposition of Mifid, which came into force November 1
In parallel with its parliamentary procedure, which ended today with the vote by Congress on the amendments incorporated into the draft in the Senate, the Government has submitted to a public hearing the regulations that will develop the new law, with the aim of both coming into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the different groups agreed to highlight the effort made by deputies and senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulations in order to ensure investor protection and regulate in detail the activities of the entities so that the markets function efficiently.
MIFID, which amends the Securities Markets Act, involves the modernisation of financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and fostering cooperation between the various supervisors in the European Union.
The new regulation will allow the provision of financial advisory services to both specialized firms and natural or legal persons and will create a new type of financial services firms (ESIS), financial advisory societies (AFIs), which join securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it expands the number of systems for the execution of transactions on financial instruments, so that regulated secondary markets are joined by multilateral trading systems and order internalization systems, which will compete with current exchange managers.
The Law also requires investment services companies to disclose in the market information about the key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management forms and requires them to keep a record of all operations they carry out, to facilitate supervision by the CNMV.
In its passage through the Congressional Economic Commission, several modifications were incorporated, among which it highlights that securitized debts are considered a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which has been demonstrated by what has happened with the debt of high-risk US mortgages (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legally delimit the functions that graduates in Economics and Business can perform 30 years after the adoption in 1977 of the royal decree delimiting the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work on behalf of others, will not require CNMV authorization and will be able to provide its product marketing and customer acquisition services to different investment firms at the same time.
Harmonized CPI rises five-tenths in November to 4.1%
This indicator, which then serves Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation index in the European Union, provides an insight into how prices in Spain evolved during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same procedure as the employee for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, so it does not necessarily coincide with the final data, which will be released on 14 December.
"The CPI will continue at relatively high levels"
The second vice president and minister of economy, Pedro Solbes, has said that the increase of 4.1% of the CPI in November is a "temporary figure", but at the same time has indicated that the price index will continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes has pointed out in the halls of the Congress that "even if the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential with respect to the monetary union remains "more or less" the same of the last few years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the government did not have such a high rise.
"We expected a figure of around 4%," the economy minister acknowledged with regard to the forwarded data today.
Virgin plans to raise <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>42 billion with Northern Rock in three years
Northern Rock’s deposits have fallen more than 50 percent to <0xC2><0xA3>12 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16.8 billion) since it went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England.
At the time, it had accumulated a record deposit of over <0xC2><0xA3>25 billion, a figure that has fallen progressively in two and a half months due to the mistrust of its customers and despite the guarantee of 100 percent of that money offered by the Government and which it will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rename the entity with its financial brand Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the revenues in British banks that are deposited in the next three years to get those remaining <0xC2><0xA3>18 billion to reach the target of <0xC2><0xA3>30 billion.
The group of tycoon Richard Branson, known for its striking advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) annually on advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
Northern Rock named this week’s offer from Virgin’s consortium, which includes three other companies, as its preferred one to bail him out of bankruptcy.
Totana Mayor Arrested for Alleged Urban Corruption
The Guardia Civil has arrested this morning the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (of the Popular Party) for his alleged relationship with the plot of urban corruption uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the consistory and the police chief of the municipality have also been arrested.
José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo replaced last May Juan Morales, current MP, and until then councilor of the municipality, and that according to sources of the investigation consulted by the Chain SER, could be the 'head' of this plot.
Officers continue to register municipal units and the Urbanismo council and no more arrests are ruled out in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the plot of urban corruption uncovered earlier this week, has been charged.
As Cadena SER reported yesterday, the lawyer of the 'popular' deputy Juan Morales, therefore stalked, was stopped leaving the home of Morales with important documentation related to the plot.
Moreover, the object of the investigation, according to sources of the investigation, is the alleged collection of commissions from Morales in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight people arrested.
Bono agrees to lead the candidacy of the PSOE for Toledo and preside over the Congress if they win the elections.
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero, to top the PSOE list for Toledo for the upcoming general elections and to be president of the Congress in case the Socialists win the general elections.
This was announced at a press conference by the Secretary of Organization of the PSOE, José Blanco, and Bono himself, after the meeting that he held this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The head of the executive has justified the offer to the former minister because "it is important to have the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he has pointed out that "yes it seems" that the Manchego politician will be the candidate of the socialist group to preside over the Congress if the socialists win in the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n, who made public on November 15 his decision not to run for the next general election and to abandon his career in active politics to dedicate himself to fighting climate change in the university arena.
The former minister has acknowledged that the prime minister has not stopped insisting that he return to the political avant-garde since leaving it two years ago.
In addition, he noted that, just as citizens know who will be the economic vice president if the PSOE wins the elections, his party has wanted to announce who will preside over the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he reaches office, Bono hopes to turn the House into “the house of respect and not of insult or shouting” and make it “more and more like the citizens.”
“Sometimes it unfortunately seems that the only place in Madrid where you can’t speak calmly and calmly is Congress, the president of the government was interrupted in the Senate 26 times.”
He has also had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n and "his good work" and has not wanted to be already occupying his position in order not to fall into what, as he has pointed out, his opponents could see as "prepotence".
Climate Propaganda
Since the climate change movement relentlessly pursues both skeptics of its predictions and those who prioritize other political and social battles, it is bound to show iron coherence.
And more a leader of the movement who is the president of the government like Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and even proposes to sign a "new contract with the planet".
That approach forces him to explain why the action, or inaction, of his government has decisively contributed to Spain leading the EU in non-compliance with Kyoto.
Who are responsible for the non-compliance, in what sectors it has occurred and why your government, that of the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it requires you to explain with the utmost clarity to the Spaniards what measures you are going to take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what citizen habits will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be forced to make, what economic consequences it will have.
That is, who will sacrifice themselves and who will pay to save the planet.
But there has not been, nor will there be, such explanations.
This is because it is about sacrificing and paying.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, inconvenient and threatening for business and individual accounts.
Even the cent of the gasoline suggested by the PSOE has seemed so electorally dangerous to Zapatero that he has hurried to deny it.
That is, it is about saving the planet with nothingness, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With shocking phrases, commissions, committees, protocols, new positions.
With contracts with the planet, that gentleman so useful for election campaigns that he neither speaks nor denounces nor demands, but adorns the rallies and inspires tenderness.
As long as it is limited to being a purely virtual contracting party and does not pretend to travel by bicycle or cool off with the fan.
The mayor and the head of the local police of Totana arrested for an alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the City Council and a hotel businessman for possible urban crimes, sources of the investigation have reported today.
The mayor was arrested at his home and has been transferred to the Consistory, in whose offices he is currently located alongside numerous agents, who have also gone to the City Council of Urbanism and the municipal company for the management of Industrial and Housing Land.
These three arrests add to the six made last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of rustic land in urbanizable for the Galician company Nuaria to build 4,000 homes, after paying illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other people were not arrested but are charged in the summary, which instructs the No. 1 Court of Totana.
The first six detainees were made available to the court today.
According to the sources, the former councilor of Totana and today the autonomous parliamentarian of the PP, Juan Morales, is being investigated.
In addition, the former woman, owner of a real estate agency registered today in Totana, has been charged, as has the current girlfriend of the former councillor, who lives in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the Vigues lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A., was arrested in Nigr<0xC3><0xA1>n (Pontevedra), as was Pablo José M.G., director of Soelo de Inmonuar, an agency integrated into the aforementioned Group, and through which the bribes would have been made.
The investigation is led by the Urban Crimes Group of the Civil Guard’s Central Operational Unit (UCO), whose agents, in addition to the arrests, practiced eleven registrations, most of them in companies related to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
A single person was then arrested in Totana, specifically the owner of a well-known poultry company in the region, which could have acted as an intermediary.
Grupo Nuaria was responsible for developing the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired in Totana 2.2 million square meters of land that were requalified and its project would involve doubling the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group integrates companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, dedicated to the real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the Viennese car parks of the streets of Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, Venezuela and Fernando el Cat<0xC3><0xB3>lico square; Hogartel, dedicated to the sector of direct marketing; Preconizia, focused on the promotion, sale and installation of elements.

Our Finnish correspondent gives us this comment yesterday in the most important newspaper in Finland (by the way in the head of the PISA report on the educational level in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day that there appeared, curiously, the criticism of Blackburn’s book:
"The contents of the signature of Philosophy have jumped to public opinion as a result of the tragedy of Jokela's school.
The culprit of the deaths, a high school student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Counselor in charge of the subject of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded from the pages of the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato and stated that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in the institutes.

A colleague gives information on the introduction of Internet download crimes in the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading a song would be a crime punishable by six months to a year.
On the other hand, if you steal in-store discs worth less than 400 euros, it is simply considered missing (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal from the store up to 1,000 euros, the theft is already a crime, but the penalty is still less than the one imposed on the download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is still lower than that of the unloading (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the exchange of compacts.
Participating in a tumultuous litigation has a penalty of three months to one year (article 154 of the Penal Code) and the exchange would have a penalty of six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a movie on DVD, according to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of copyrighted and unauthorized films is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).
In short, if my colleague is right, someone is going to get his hand, a very long hand.

My primary care physician gives me one of his articles on rare research titled: ‘Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less.’
That is, the feelings generated by the monthly salary of the workers depend on what the comrades earn.
The study has been performed using tomographic magnetic resonance imaging at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Neurocognition Imaging group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: “The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed.”
The researchers observed that if both received the same pay when they were right, the activation was moderate, but if one received twice as much, the activation was greater.
I don’t know if this conclusion required so much science.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly persecuting war criminals in the Balkans for eight years from the prosecution office of the Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia, located in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla will leave with a bittersweet taste, because the main culprits of the Srebrenica massacre - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were killed -, former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, remain at large.
Its names are on that list from which the documentary of the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach takes its title, 'La lista de Carla' (2006, not premiered in Spain) which, with the rhythm of a police thriller, follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to pursue the fleeing criminals and pressure the governments involved to narrow the pork.
What insurance is suitable for me?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the event of possible accidents, is a significant expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, the age of the card, the marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use of the car, among others.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
First of all, we need to be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured.
This commitment materializes in an insurance contract, which stipulates that the company receives the value of the agreed premium in exchange for being held liable for the obligation to pay damages in the event of a claim.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, the age of the card, the marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use given to it, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so that the more likely you are to suffer an accident, the higher the fee to be paid.
It is for this reason that both those over 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as the statistics reflect that they have a lower injury rate due to their prudence.
In addition, companies have come to the conclusion that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use that is given to the vehicle will influence the frequency, and with it the probability of having some kind of failure.
Increasing the frequency increases the chances.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the premium price.
That is why the driver must study the situation well to choose the car insurance that best fits his profile.
We will explain here the most significant variables when choosing one or another type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insured, offers a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 face various disadvantages when it comes to hiring insurance at an affordable price, such as limited driving experience and the age of the card.
Although the ideal to be well insured is full-risk insurance, there are other more economical options.
The most cautious drivers can opt for a whole risk with deductible, so that they get insurance coverage at all risk but at a more feasible price.
This kind of agreement would involve the customer paying a part of the amount of the claim.
"The part of the amount of the claim that the client contributes will be pre-set based on the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount," Luis Noguera, chief in charge in Spain of First Europa, an online insurance broker, said in a statement.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer ensures protection against damage caused to third parties, although not against those caused in his own car.
In addition, it would be covered by theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
A piece of advice.
If you are under the age of 25, try to be careful and avoid claims as much as possible, as this will affect the bonus, and may reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the base rate that the company owns.
On the contrary, a penalty is a surcharge on that base fee.
The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and its profit.
If the company has had a good year, it can afford to increase the bonuses," clarifies Noguera.
After the age of 25, it is easier for drivers to take out insurance, as the accident rate is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason, the most recommended is to hire a whole risk with franchise.
"Normally young people cannot make use of the experience previously acquired when using an accident, and even when driving," says the director in Spain of the European company, adding that most of the accidents occur in the second year of driving, once past the 'fear of the newcomer'.
However, if the client is married but still has no children it is preferable to negotiate full-risk insurance, as long as their financial situation allows it, of course.
For their part, marriages with children are considered by insurers as the public with the lowest injury rate, so the surcharges will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be one at full risk with deductible (can be this of 300 euros), or, when a high level of bonus is available, one to third party extended from the third year of life of the vehicle.
"They conduct a more relaxed driving and have a greater purchasing power to afford the luxury of taking on a larger amount of franchise," said Luis Noguera.
For retirees it is advisable to have an all-risk insurance with deductible (this being 150 euros), or one to third party extended when you have a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the event of possible accidents, but also because it represents an important expense, which is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that best suits us according to our personal situation.
The Celtic is looking for a point worth the octaves in Milan
Milan and Celtic are measured on Tuesday in San Siro in search of the missing point to achieve their respective goals in the closing of the league of the 'Champions', as the Italians serve to be first and the Scots to judge their classification.
The Italians add up ten points and already certified their pass with a tie in Portugal on the fifth day, while the Celtic has nine points, but still needs another to make sure that Shakhtar, with six, and that he receives Benfica, who has four, does not ahead of him.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the end of the entire sixth day, as Milan have to play the Club World Cup in Japan, where it debuts on day 13 in the semifinals in search of a place for the final of 16.
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and the tie in Giuseppe Meazza seems the most expected result, although the two teams will try to come out for a victory, as the Italians will not want to speculate at home and the Celtic knows that winning would be first and would ensure a better crossing in the eighth.
Gordon Strachan’s set could even serve a defeat to qualify if Shakhtar doesn’t win, but he can’t be trusted because at nine points the pass is for the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1) but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanists will try to bitter the night to the Scots, who hope to get in eighth for the second time in the restructured Champions League and consecutively, after they were precisely defeated in that round last season with a goal from Kaka in the prolongation (1-0) after the 0-0 of the one.
Waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' will be the Shakhtar who only deserves the victory, in case he loses the Celtic, both to get into the eighth and to continue in UEFA.
Benfica, despite being the last and with no options to continue in the top European competition, could reach third place with a win, with which UEFA would play.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls have started their first tour in Vancouver, Canada, in front of about 20,000 spectators since they disbanded in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) stated shortly before their concert at Vancouver's GM Place Stadium that the group's reunion is "brilliant".
About 20,000 people ran out of tickets to attend the concert, which included a video that tells the story of the band that went wild in the late 1990s.
The reunion and the world tour coincide with the release of a new album that collects its main hits as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which in Spain publishes EMI.
The five Spice Girls took to the stage wearing bracelets given to them by the husband of 'Posh Spice', British football player David Beckham.
The athlete was among the crowd that crowded GM Place, even though Victoria’s nerves had banned him days earlier.
In the run-up to the show, Victoria Beckham noted that the British star "hasn't seen our dressing room, for nothing, so I'm nervous about what he's going to think of the show."
'Sporty Spice', whose departure from the group in 1998 "due to differences between us" caused the quintet to disband two years later, also expressed his nervousness during a press meeting, two hours before the start of the show.
“I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that the feeling of the world has changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm glad I made the decision," Chisholm said of the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "things have been fixed and we love each other very much."
But many things have changed since the Spice Girl last performed together in 1998.
For starters, according to CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
Upon arrival at the airport, an army of nannies awaited them.
Among the five are seven children.
Following the Vancouver concert, the group will perform in California (USA), San Jose (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
They will perform in Madrid on December 23.
New gas fears between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute over gas prices between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk that Russia’s export of fuel to Western Europe will be affected.
Most of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so each friction between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises the price of gas, Russia will have to pay higher transit rates.
A dispute earlier last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, the monopoly owner of the gas, Gazprom, trying to agree on how much money Ukraine should pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom said it will charge Ukraine more, as Ukraine has pledged to pay an extra 50% in 2008 for gas coming from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say it could be that Ukraine will pay 40% more for Gazprom’s imports.
“It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important transits for gas during the talks,” Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters.
“Changes in gas prices should not be related to our arguments about the levels of transit rates [to Western Europe] via Ukraine.”
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut off supplies to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a drop in exports to Western Europe, which quickly raised prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the EU’s supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supply from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet nations of Central Asia.
NHS "will have to test foreign workers"
The Scottish NHS needs to monitor criminal records of employees from outside Europe, a watchdog said.
Auditor General Robert Black’s recommendation came after it was found that a foreign doctor was linked to the attack on Glasgow airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish NHS has no exact idea of the amount of foreign staff it has.
However, his report pointed to other checks that are carried out correctly through a sample of five health authorities.
The auditor-general checked the amount of foreign staff hired outside the European Economic Area, following the attacks on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at Paisley’s Royal Alexandra Hospital, was arrested at the airport after crashing a jeep at the gates of the airport terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who acted at the Old Bailey by video conferencing in October, accused in connection with the alleged car bombings in the UK.
NHS expects to carry out pre-employment checks on candidates, to make sure they meet the qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the UK.
Although the Scottish Health Board uses “Disclosure Scotland” to conduct criminal background checks, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside of the UK.
The Auditor General’s report recommends, among other measures, that boards should rely on guidance from the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with criminal controls in many countries outside the UK.
“Although we found some of the personal records with evidence of these controls, this is not a routine review,” the report says.
Black states that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes that: "Our report highlights areas that can be improved to ensure that the necessary information is available in the NHS's foreign staff number."
BMA Scotland President Dr Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks could identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
“The report suggests that pre-employment checks work in NHS Scotland but it is not clear what the added value of the recommendations made is,” he explained.
Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreign people, most of them doctors and nurses.
But the auditor-general warned that the number may be higher, in part because boards have trouble identifying which employees have indefinite residence permits.
The investigation also found that the verification procedures established by NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were being widely complied with.
This includes passport checks, work permits and qualification checks.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing the foreign nationals’ pre-employment policy and guideline at the NHS.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: “I had a great interest in this work being carried out in the wake of the Glasgow airport terrorist attack.
He added that the Scottish government, in conjunction with the health boards, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this will be reflected in the update of the pre-employment control guidelines for all working groups - including foreigners - that they planned to publish next month.
Joy Division dominates the film awards
Control, the biographical film about late Joy Division vocalist Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including the Best Picture award.
The trophies were also given to protagonist Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he was chosen for the role of Curtis, for director Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Actress Judi Dench was named Best Actress for the thriller "Notes of a Scandal".
And Bond star Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for putting a British film on the international stage.
The awards were presented in a ceremony at the London Roundhouse.
Control followed Curtis' rise to fame with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, at the age of 23.
The black-and-white film, featuring soundtracks from The Killers, David Bowie and New Order, was produced at just <0xC2><0xA3>3,000.
But Dutch photographer Corbijn, already known for the iconic cover of U2’s Joshua Tree album, won two awards – Best Director and Best Debut Director.
Rock music was the center of another award-winning ceremony—such as Julien Temple’s film about The Clash’s vocalist Joe Strummer—winning the award for best documentary.
The award for Best Actor went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as the driver of a Russian mafia boss in London, in David Cronenberg’s film Eastern Promises.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing hard, received the Richard Jarris Award for his contribution to British cinema.
The fiftieth, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming Indiana Jones' sequel "The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull".
Winstone said he was proud to receive that award, named after Harris, Camelot star and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
“It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me,” he said.
“I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, it's really an honor."
The Independent Film Awards, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa festival supporters and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia Arrests 208 Terrorists
Saudi Arabia said it had arrested 208 militants from terrorist cells who were planning an imminent attack on oil facilities, as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
State television of the world’s largest oil supplier said one of the cells was planning to smuggle missiles.
Al Qaeda supporters have mounted a campaign against the local monarchy, in alliance with the United States, since 2003 following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants formed by foreign residents was planning an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, the TV report said.
Saudi Arabia created a 35,000-strong force to protect the Abqaiq facility, the world’s largest oil plant, after a failed Al-Qaeda attack in 2006.
The report, citing a statement by the Saudi Interior Minister, said 18 of the detainees belonged to a cell led by a “missile launcher expert” who has entered the country.
The minister said the militants had planned to smuggle eight shells into the country.
Another 22 of the detainees were planning murders of religious leaders and security forces.
The government warned religious leaders that they should be more active in stopping Saudis traveling to Iraq from joining Al-Qaeda as militants to fight allied forces and back the Muslim Shiite government, which is considered heretical by the most extreme Saudi Sunnis.
Al-Qaeda militants are targeting many religious in Saudi Arabia who have been appointed by the authorities to support the policies of the government-dominated royal family.
The militants – recruited by calls from Osama Bin Laden, the Saudi-born al-Qaeda leader, to harass the country’s pro-Western government – targeted government-associated foreigners’ residences, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This was a great effort by the security forces, since five months of work," the interior minister's spokesman told state television.
Those arrested also include a 16-person “media cell” in Medina, whose goal was to promote “takfiri thinking” — the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims that supports violence against Muslims considered infidels and apostates.
The arrest includes 32 other people accused of providing financial support and support to the militants.
Venus' climate can give an idea of the future of Earth
Venus may once have been a suitable place for life, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft in orbit showed the planet more like an Earth twin than had previously been observed.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
The two planets are similar in size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus may have had conditions similar to those that made Earth a habitable planet, scientists now believe.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and slower solar rotation sent Venus to a very different type of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is enough to melt lead and is eroded by hurricane winds and lightning storms.
The results from the European Space Agency for Venus Express, which has been studying the planet for a year, provide an insight into how Earth could develop catastrophic changes due to the climate.
Professor Fred Taylor, from the Department of Physics at Oxford University and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: “It’s being clarified why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, when there are two planets so similar.
“Our new data makes it possible to build a scenario where Venus began as Earth, possibly with a habitable environment millions of years ago.”
Police Detain 'Enriched Uranium'
One kilo of radioactive material, which they claim is enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The cash could not confirm whether it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold for $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).
It is still open
Mitt Romney says it’s not worthy for presidential candidates to answer a snowman’s questions.
However, Republican presidential candidates eventually agree to hold a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary and current voters record questions on video and send them for broadcast among the candidates.
None of the questions posed on Wednesday afternoon were more ridiculous than that of the snowman who asked Democrats about climate warming in the YouTube Republican Party debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected much of the state of the Republican party ahead of next year’s elections.
It is not known exactly how the CNN producers, who co-sponsored the debate, chose YouTube videos to show candidates to candidates.
But the first half hour of debate, the longest devoted to a single topic, focused on immigration.
The issue is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to turn the dial when they heard ideas they liked: Broadcasters noticed spikes in approval when candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
The night’s toughest word exchanges took place between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who has been leading the crucial Iowa and New Hampshire polls.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney’s reputation as he was soft on illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
Both responded aggressively when asked if any candidate could support an "amnesty" (allowing illegals to regularize their situation and giving them the possibility of obtaining citizenship).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, reached agreement on the issue.
Neither has the word of being nominated candidate, but both remain in the race perhaps because both alerted to the issue of immigration before the others.
At least in immigration, and in general terms, candidates share views: increased border surveillance, intolerance to illegal immigrants.
This topic, along with China’s fear of toxic toys and other concerns about the outside world, helps Republicans forget, or minimize, the divisions between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate turned into awkward when other topics appeared.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported gun control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney debated whether immersion in water should be considered torture.
One person asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to stumble into the position that while the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe in the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another person asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee — now, against all odds, first in the most recent Iowa poll, thanks to his longtime Christian conservatism — said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressured to respond if Jesus would be in favor, he laughed saying that Jesus was too smart to be a candidate in the election.
The race is unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee is on the rise in Iowa, coinciding with Liberal Ron Paul’s fundraising campaigns and his heated statements from Wednesday’s debate.
The two have come out of the background, because the two wings of the party did not agree on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the party early and convincingly with a winning message about the greatness of America, satisfying both party wings.
This time the game is divided and the result is far from clear.
Dolores Labor
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole in which to sink; but it also emerges
As political scandals continue in England, this one is not particularly interesting.
They don’t seem to have sold influences, nor are they exorbitant hotel accounts in Paris, nor extramarital finger sucking.
But it has been revealed that a wealthy businessman has disguised contributions to the English Labour government party of more than <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 ($1.3 million), for nearly four years using false names, and that the party did not denounce him.
Two months ago, when the prime minister evaded calling for an election, foolishly insulting British intelligence by declaring that opinion polls did not influence his decision, the hope was that he would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the liberal Democrat leads with increasing ingenuity, because the feared Mr. Brown has gone from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The bailout of Northern Rock, a bank in trouble, demonstrated regulatory weakness and poverty of judgment in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code have put business groups, together, against the government.
The tax authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an unimaginable administrative loophole.
A trio of retired generals started a riot in the House of Lords, protesting against cuts in military spending: being ministers of the armed forces is, they claimed, a part-time job.
Now it is the multiple donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Labour secretary general (and former accomplice) has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is irrevocably walking towards the exit.
Governments can reach a tipping point after they are unable to govern.
People don’t believe them as politicians, but they usually suspend their disbelief when a new batch takes control.
Once it’s clear that the prime minister can’t make things better, that he doesn’t have much time left, that suspension is too much: public officials begin to fail; cabinet ministers expose themselves; the press looks for bad news; and the government gets on the defensive and doesn’t focus.
On one hand, Brown’s position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot defend himself by arguing that he is new.
Although I wanted to renounce Tony Blair, he was his lieutenant-in-chief.
The problems of Northern Rock and the authority registration tax are related to the decisions Brown made as Chancellor of the Exchequer.
And even when he’s not directly involved in Blairish’s setbacks — or “cash for partners,” the investigation of political party funding — voters can assume that if he is.
However, Mr. Brown's situation is not as bad as it seems.
The plates are not as bad as the Tories want to show.
As in Mr. Bean, no one has died, nor has he been scammed directly.
And the remedy, though painful, is to give what Mr. Brown’s naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political donation scandal is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations to charitable gifts, says he does not want public recognition for his benevolence.
This may be the case, but the decision is not his.
The anti-anonymity laws for big political contributors are clear and there is a clear reason: the public has a right to know who is buying access to those in power.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew of Mr. Abraham’s deal, and that it was not illegal, will obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, head of fundraising who was asked about the donations in October.
But Mr. Brown is not so far involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these performances, although the bulk of the payments were made after he took control of the office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He has been quick to condemn his party for violating the law, but is diluted in decision-making by a family matter, a commission of inquiry into the matter — led, to a large extent, by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, morals are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it is a matter for the police.
In addition, there are other things that Mr Brown must do, such as finding a permanent and independent head for the Public Life Standards Committee, because he has not had one in six months, and he must also push for a genuine reform of party funding.
This will require hard cooperative work by Labour with the Tories, and perhaps a renunciation of the special financial situation with the unions – bitternesses measured for a partisan like Mr. Brown.
But he has to face some partisan facts.
Conservatives now have a good level of support in polls; he has two years to win voters; and the only way he can move to victory is to act with impeccable probity and solid competition.
Sharks Cards
Is the subprime mortgage crisis infecting the American credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is natural that some dorsal fins swim excitedly around.
Today that the American housing market is in crisis, predators have their eyes set on the country’s credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate that credit card losses can reach $99 million if the subprime mortgage crisis infects other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of contagion are already seen.
There is an increase in both card charges and crime rates, which measures the proportion of balances that have not been amortized or that have more than 30 days delay respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken over 1.4 million bucks in its U.S. consumer finance business, in part due to the weakness of card borrowers.
However, it is too early for panic.
Delinquency and delinquency are at low levels.
According to Moody’s, a rating agency, in the third quarter the crime rate of 3.89% was almost a percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the U.S. Bankruptcy Law of Persons (2005) resulted in a sharp drop in bankruptcy applications, which in turn represent a large loss on credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore delinquency) would be growing again, or it may happen that conditions for borrowers were worsening.
The industry also reports strong payment rates, which show how much of its debts consumers pay each month.
And trust in credit cards and asset-backed securities is pretty firm, despite paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts emission volumes for 2007 will be about 25% higher than last year.
The direct channels of infection of the crisis between subprime mortgages and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers like to charge credit card debt now that credit institutions are expiring.
But credit card issuers look more at the flow of liquidity than asset values, so falling prices don’t necessarily trigger a change in borrowers’ lending capacity.
They can even work to advance the issuers.
Incentives for consumers to continue to amortize the mortgage decreases if the properties are worth less than the value of the loan; and as a result, the payment of the card’s debt rises in the list of priorities.
Card issuers can also respond quickly and flexibly to difficult conditions as mortgage lenders, changing interest rates or altering credit balances.
That, in theory, should reduce the risk of a rapid restocking of assets.
“We’re not going to wake up one day and re-evaluate all the loans,” said Gary Perlin, chief financial officer at Capital One.
If a sudden subprime infection in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If house prices are lower and a credit crunch pushes America into recession, the industry undoubtedly faces a tougher future.
We need to keep an eye on those dorsal fins.
British bankers found guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who went on trial for their responsibility for fraud with Enron’s former head of finance office, Andrew Fastow, were found guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocent on seven counts of fraud for colluding with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to get rich at the expense of employees.
They were sent to trial in January.
But during the hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each was convicted of collusion in fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of the Scottish group PLC at the Royal Bank, became famous in Britain for extradition proceedings that lasted two years.
In the United States, his case marks the loose end of an investigation launched after the collapse of Enron in 2001.
Initially, the charges against the bankers were to have alerted Fastow in 2002 that he was the target of a government investigation into Enron’s downfall.
The indictment against the bankers - doubled the "NatWest Three" - alleges that they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his former top aide, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron company controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of a myriad of frauds in Enron, which helped its spiral of bankruptcy.
In 2002, the bank valued the subsidiary's interest at zero, but the three Britons knew it would value up.
A company under Kopper’s control bought the subsidiary’s bank interest in $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for interest in the company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely represented Enron, as the energy company would pay Greenwich NatWest $20 million for its parts of the subsidiary.
But the 20 million remained in the hands of British bankers, Fastow and others.
Bankers charged $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about $12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow was convicted on two counts of conspiracy in Enron's collapse.
The British trio were arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a three-year, one-month sentence in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay the $1 million they required to live in the United States while the trial was being held.
Enron, one of the nation’s seven largest companies, declared bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could not hide the debt of millions or make their failing businesses look successful.
The collapse lost thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in market values and more than two million in pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were charged last year for their roles in the company’s collapse.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay’s conviction for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when he died of a heart attack last year.
Neither down nor out in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and sufficient fuel capacity to fly directly from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is a small expense for some of the rich Russians.
“It has a capacity of up to 18 passengers,” says Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
“But nobody asks for that model of so many seats because it’s for family private flights or for company presidents.”
Mr. Firer was in charge of the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaire’s Fair, a four-day consumer orgy held at an event center near the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, 200 other luxury suppliers had installed their display stands, hoping to attract new wealthy Russians to all kinds of products, from mahogany-crafted yachts to diamond-encrusted car grills, worth 50 cents.
Mr. Firer looks cautiously at a bright orange Porsche at the stand next to his.
“It’s a nice car, but it’s nickel and caldera compared to us,” he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private jets."
Fueled by the oil boom, the Russian capital resembles Dallas when it was at its peak.
“We lived the same way in 1890, when some wealthy Americans came to Europe, where they were seen as materialists,” says Marshall Goldman, a senior professor at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
“Like the Saudis of the 1970s and the Japanese of the 1990s, the Russians are emerging as the world’s biggest consumers and spenders.”
The most exclusive luxury brands in the world are looking for their share of the cake.
Elsewhere in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry will be held this week with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods in markets such as Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times company)
Russia has 53 billionaires making a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, the second-grade rich include 103,000 Russian billionaires whose money reaches $670 billion, according to a study of the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists from the Center for Economic and Financial Research, a local think thank.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians were below subsistence level.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow – and that’s why we’re all here,” says Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative for David Morris, the London jeweler.
She attends the fair for the first time with the Russian distributor of the brand, the Soho Jewelry group.
“Women are impeccably prepared and men are very dignified.”
Visiting the fair on Sunday night, dressed in afternoon suit, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their clients and themselves as millionaires.
“I was looking at the cars and I’m trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche,” said Yumatova, who reeled off the design suit she wore as a red carpet veteran dishing with Joan Rivers.
The fair aims to attract the new rich, the type of buyers who would be willing to stay several hours in a warehouse that mixes brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum pens, Mövenpick ice cream, custom pool tables, Dubai apartments and Gund teddy bears.
The general public can buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57 dollars).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically at a stand of Dutch royal Delft porcelain, in front of a wall-sized reconstruction of a Rembrandt painting, made of hand-painted tiles.
“Of course, the Russians are more interested in bling-bling.
In fact, the sellers said that the richest Russians (10 to 15 years, by Russian standards) have changed their tastes from eye-catching logos to limited-edition brands, which would not be exhibited at a trade fair.
However, several thousand people – millionaires in cash, millionaires’ emissaries or tourists – fill the hallways every day.
And some of them buy.
On the first night of the fair last Thursday, Roman Ershov, general manager of King Koil beds, said he sold two $70,000 mattress systems each, made of silk, cashmere and cotton interwoven with gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, in charge of sales for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that customises luxury cars, said he had sold three chain-shaped car grills for Rolls Royce Phantom at $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with rays embedded in Swarovski colored crystals, so that it resembled a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for four wheels.
“The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a portrait of his wife made of zirconium cubes, is not necessarily going to drive on those wheels,” Mr. Karapetian says.
"He's going to keep the car in his garage, along with 30 or 40 other cars."
Even if many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian makes it clear that the phrase "Russian millionaire" does not mean exclusivity, given the surge in real estate prices.
“If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you’re probably already a millionaire, at least on paper if it’s not in cash,” he said.
“There are more of them than you think.”
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be wealthy by supporting the Continental Alliance, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red (British-style) phone booths filled with stacks of fake $1 million bills.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 fake bills for the Millionaire’s Fair.
Visitors stopped to shake piles of money, asking their friends to take pictures with their mobiles while resting on piles of money, or pocketing a couple of millions.
“You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire,” Karryev says.
'Surgery' Could Cause Death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the window of the "A Little Healthier" restaurant and saw an ambulance climb up White Cape Cod, two doors down West Scott Avenue.
Suddenly, a police patrol car appeared.
And then another one.
“Then I saw the ambulance come up,” Mr. Livingston, the restaurant’s supervisor, said that day Wednesday.
"That's when I knew someone had died."
Authorities learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, 41, assistant to the director of the Newark police department.
Investigators are now trying to determine if she died due to a procedure performed by an unauthorized plastic surgeon, who is not yet identified by police, but who works at the 212 West Scott Avenue house.
The authorities have not yet determined what caused Mrs. Arroyo's death, but they are waiting for the toxicology test, although the results will not be available until a few weeks later. This will help solve the mysterious death that has saddened the upper ranks of the Newark police.
Mrs. Arroyo had been assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
“She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious,” Mr. McCarthy says about Arroyo in a phone interview Wednesday.
"She was my guardian."
She was protecting me.”
Mr. McCarthy said Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer working for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that he left two 14- and 11-year-old sons, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokesman for the County Union Attorney, Theodore J. Romankow, said detectives are trying to determine whether Mrs. Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized surgical procedure.
"That's one of the possibilities," Walsh said.
“This is an ongoing investigation.”
Authorities said they arrived at the house around 3 p.m.
On November 21, they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was pronounced dead on the spot.
It’s been more than a week and authorities have said little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, named Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs. Walsh could not say whether Mrs. Castro has been interrogated by the authorities.
Researchers are trying to determine what part of the house was used as a medical consultation.
On Wednesday, no one responded to the door at Mrs. Castro’s home, where a rotten rose is located in the front of the house, and a Dalmatian barbarian in the back.
A blue drum labeled "vainillin ethyl" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - was found at the garage door, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hang from hooks on one side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when she arrived in Newark after 25 years in the NYPD, Mrs. Arroyo was of invaluable help in getting to know the new island city and its crude political culture.
“She would say, ‘You have to watch with this one or that one,’” he said.
“She was always here when I was, and also when I wasn’t.
It's embarrassing."
The Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates to raise the stock market.
Stocks jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market expected the Federal Reserve to calm credit conditions with interest rate cuts, which rose with reassuring comments from the U.S. central bank vice president.
Stock exchanges loosened in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, number two of Ben Bernanke, chairman of the reserve, declared that policy makers must be “flexible and pragmatic” in responding to continued tensions in financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure markets amid growing samples of credit exchanges, Mr Kohn said the recent turbulence was “partly reversed by the improvement in the market in late September and during October.”
If the upward trend persists, it would increase the possibility of additional adjustments to financial conditions for real estate and business, Kohn said.
The comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reserve is ready to inject fresh capital into U.S. markets and to make subsequent interest rate cuts to stabilize credit conditions.
The observations also helped calm Wall Street amid bad news for the U.S. economy, such as home sales that hit the lowest record in October.
The consequences of the financial turmoil were accentuated by a notice from Bear Stearns, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, equivalent to 4% of its total workforce, in a global cost reduction to offset the losses of its investments in U.S. sub-prime mortgages.
Only 20 of those jobs are expected to enter London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose by 331 points, or 2.55%, to close at 13,289.40, while the S&P 500 broad index rose by 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7%, to close at 6,306.2, adding more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 billion to the value of Britain’s top-tier companies.
Germany’s Dax index rose 2.6%, and France’s CAC40 was above 2.3%.
Previously, the resurgence of credit tension in the markets was highlighted after a strong demand in a three-month fund auction by the European Central Bank, which considered these loans to European commercial banks at 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England to follow the performance of the Federal Reserve and the ECB and to inject extra funds into London’s stock markets strained credit and three-month “Liber” loan rates among British banks, the biggest rise since September, by 6.59 percent, after a steady rise since 12 November.
England takes Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara to court
Here are two dilemmas, each as difficult as the other.
Who should hit No. 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, none are less important in the face of the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the selection that is on loan—with that particular title at least, is here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and also because the desk of Hugh Morris, the director of England, is starting to fill with offers to become a national selector, and if not, part one.
He who does not get the sixth place of the bat will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and sport too.
It is not easy to throw what one man does at the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the bottom level, sometimes out of lack of luck rather than capacity.
Not only in cricket the choice is difficult, as judgments are required that always end up being subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to get up?
Is it fair for Shah if he does?
The same question could be asked in another aspect if, says John Edwards or “Tubby” Banerjee, two brilliant young executives with good grades and who know the business well, were promoted to the board: there is only room for one of them.
Who should say what is a good level for a cricketer, unless they give him the chance to sink or swim at the next chance?
Figures naturally have a big influence on decisions, but they also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player has to catch the captain's eye at the same time as taking a "wicket" and a batter to get opportunities to change order if he wants to make an impact as a player someday.
But catching the eye of the coaches is more complicated.
There were many who improved last season, for example, James Anderson, who certainly plays in the first test even if Stephen Harrison declares himself for "fit and bowls" like the wind on the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets in 33 races each to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same average, but both have had their highs and can expect more from these.
The games of Shah or Bopara in the Asgiriya stadium can only be a matter of opinion.
The option can break or make a man’s career, or it can mean a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and did well in the first, with 5 wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to establish himself at the same time who came to become a player of importance, and despite scoring a double hundred against Australia in Australia, he can still be underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after another discussion at today’s session at Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservation instincts and favor Shah’s greater experience over the exuberance of young Bopara.
There are arguments for both.
In favour of Shah is his brilliant and valuable debut test of the early '88 in Bombay, 32 first-class hundreds against only 6 from Bopara, who, at 22, is seven years younger, and has an excellent record against spin bowling.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two shifts in May against West Indias in the test at Lords, his home as a Middlesex player, and that caused an immediate rejection from the selectors when Vaughan claimed his place for the next match, it seemed to have taken from his "batting" something of a boost than in Bombay.
On the contrary, the Essex team has the joy of living on swords.
He holds himself up for nothing on the cricket field and his attitude was summed up as when he toppled his vehicle at an exhibition for England car sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and presumably a shock, but the first thing he did was take out his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who was looking at the distance, to say to him with excitement, “Did you see that?”
Bopara is the best player, he is including his slippery pass to have effects on his moves that seem to satisfy him, as he beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the best time, another.
Perhaps that is the true art of selection.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah does not stand out, as the tea leaves suggest, it is he who plays here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work – and to the fight against al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, expelling the exiles who were left without cash, no visa extensions and those who expected the city to return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the militants who drove them out of their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy composed of a dozen buses, the terminal was full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned by private transport.
“I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad,” says Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I’ve read in the newspapers about what happened in Baghdad and that is safe now.”
“They say Mahdi’s army stopped killing people,” he says, referring to the Shia militia of religious militant Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops to temporarily cease.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite and teacher in the Amariyah Sunni area, returned with his two children because it was impossible to renew his visa in Syria because the regime does not want Iraqis working in his country.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him on the phone to tell him that an allied U.S. force helped pull al-Qaeda out of its stronghold west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of Jordan’s newcomers was the head of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been driven from their home in Sleikh north of Baghdad by a grenade attack after urging citizens to rise up against al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started an anti-Al Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my comrades.”
"That's why I'm back today," said 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many said they were attracted by the growing calm in the capital since U.S. troops had solidified groups of “concerned citizens,” armed and working in cooperation with the U.S. military to defend their neighborhoods.
But many said they have returned because of visa denial and lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have settled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old father of three, voiced suspicion among exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugees’ visas to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe they have fled the country because of sectarian death squads.
"We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop granting visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq," he said.
“I can’t believe in a government that supports the criminals who set my house on fire after I left it.”
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that Sunnis have been expelled from Shiite areas and vice versa, relaxing tensions.
There is a fear that a sudden wave of refugees will resurrect sectarian tensions and start the struggle.
The little sarre, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even shines for the international orientation of its higher schools.
As throughout the country, the Sarlandeans lack only an educational field.
“Yesterday I explained to a non-Sarlander for the fiftieth time that we are not French” – that was the ironic bike about themselves from the smallest federal state for its fiftieth anniversary.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg have a major role in the Saar education system, which in a study by the Institute of German Economics (IW) called "Bildungsmonitor" took fifth place.
In this way, high schools traditionally have good relations with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can finish their university career here with two or three diplomas.
As a result, the percentage of foreign students is high, at 15.6 percent.
However, the number of students from the Saarland is above average in high schools, many of whom do not have a baccalaureate.
"The Saar takes advantage of the vocational education system," says Axel Plünnecke, the education sector expert at the Institute of German Economics (IW).
More than one in five young people graduates from the Professional School, which means that the Saarland is 7 percentage points above the national average.
On the contrary, the range of possibilities for a professional-academic education is very wide.
The offer of double courses, in terms of population, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical vocational training and growing demand, the number of graduates in Engineering Sciences has fallen by a third in recent years.
That’s why the Saarland Ministry of Education forced high schools to do more advertising for engineering science majors.
"After the first study of PISA, we made some reforms in the schools of general education," says a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced comparative tests across the country.
For children to start studying the last year of the project called "Kita-Jahr" as soon as possible, this has no cost. In the meantime, this model is also imitated by the other federal states.
The comparison with the next studies will show whether the performance of the students has increased.
According to the 2003 PISA report, the number of school-developed backward pupils dropped from 29 to 20 percent.
But overall, the Saar did not improve much like other federal states.
In Bavaria, students know how to calculate better.
To the dismay of the Sarlandeans, the PISA report does not compare foreign language skills, although they could achieve good results in this field.
Although the Sarlandeans are not French, the language of the neighbors is a compulsory subject in the Institutes of Secondary Education.
Chavez changes the time.
Soon in Venezuela there will be another time zone different from the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez allowed the South American country to change the time by delaying the clock by half an hour.
Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez is now a comedian in Spain.
As reported by the Official Gazette of the Venezuelan state, according to the new law, the hour will pass to less than four hours GMT.
In this way, the South American country will have a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, as an enemy of the United States, justifies his decision by saying that the United States in its day imposed the obligation on the world by changing a full hour.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez announced the breakdown of relations with his neighboring country Colombia due to the hostage-taking action.
The leftist nationalist said he would not maintain any relationship with either the head of state or the Colombian government until conservative <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Uribe remained the president of Colombia.
“My dignity doesn’t allow me to do that,” says Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, who is pushing for constitutional reform where citizens of the oil country must decide on Sunday in a referendum.
With this reform, his power in the country could be greatly expanded.
The reason for the conflict was the decision made by Uribe to withdraw the mandate of Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez in the negotiations with the Marxist guerrilla in which it was about the release of the hostages.
On Sunday, Chavez said criticizing Uribe’s decision has offended Venezuela.
There is a lot of talk about Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez in Spain.
A new tone of call causes sensation in the country: "Why don't you shut up?" is the phrase that half a million people have already downloaded.
This phrase was uttered by the King of Spain who was upset by the continuous interruptions by left-wing populists at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007, the decline in real wages threatens the Germans.
According to a forecast, this year a decline in real wages threatens German employees despite a strong economic downturn.
Experts present a lot of reasons for a pessimistic forecast.
According to the calculations of the Hans Böckler Foundation, German employees should have a lower real-wage account in 2007 than in the previous year.
"The fault of that is the weak evolution of wages, the increase in value-added tax and the stretching of food and energy prices," Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Cycle Research reported to the Bild newspaper.
Also, the new unemployment insurance charges may correspond to the employees.
Finance Minister Peter Setinbrück told the "Neue Ostanbrücker Zeitung" that given the current situation, the intention to reduce the unemployment insurance burden by 3.3% from one year to the next is fair and reasonable.
Of course, the labor office does not have to get back into an unpleasant situation, asking for credits and subsidies from the Federal State, according to the words of a politician of the German Social Democratic Party.
On Tuesday, it became public that the inflation rate with the price explosion in the food and oil derivatives sector reached the highest level for 13 years.
Compared to last year, prices are increasing by 3%.
Venus is the twin brother of Earth.
Although its atmosphere is not suitable for life, Venus is the most Earth-like planet, something that had not yet been raised. The European probe "Venus Express" discovered rays in the atmosphere and whirlwinds in the poles, the same ones that also appear in winter on Earth.
For three decades, researchers had suspected that rays might exist on Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new evidence: it discovered electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus the rays are silent from a height of 54 kilometers from one cloud and behind another, says Cris Russell of the University of California, Los Angeles, to the scientific journal "Nature".
According to the famous Urey-Miller model of the origin of life, rays caused life on Earth: storms could have caused reactions in the ocean that, in turn, would have given rise to the amino acids that are the basic components of life.
On Venus it’s not like that: if there were life there one day, that would have to be in one of the first states of evolution,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there can be no life on the surface of Venus: atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times higher than on Earth and temperatures of 500°C prevail on the surface, oscillating in such a way that temperatures below zero can be reached.
“Possibly, Venus is an Earth’s ‘diabolical’ twin, but it’s still a twin,” Russell said.
The main objective of the Venus Express mission is to answer the question of why Venus, so similar to Earth by its mass and size, has had such a different evolution.
Since the 1990s there were no special missions, only for research of this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step for the research of Venus.
The latest findings of research that will be presented in many Nature articles, according to the researchers, underscore not only the uniqueness of Venus in the Solar System.
“This also demonstrates that neighboring planets have more in common with Earth than we had assumed,” ESA reports.
Despite the already known stormy winds at the North Pole, the researchers also discovered in the south polar region a vortex formed by clouds that spins faster.
This phenomenon is reminiscent of wind flows in the high atmospheric layers of the Earth's poles, as described by a team of researchers by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet in the Solar System has a mass almost equal to the Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers is almost as large.
This planet also called the dawn star or evening star orbits the Sun for nearly 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: one day on Venus equals 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and its atmospheric pressure of 92 bars does not closely resemble Earth, scientists start from the premise that both planets had formed under the same conditions.
The two planets had agglomerated water that on Earth remained in the oceans, but on Venus it dissociated into the universe.
While on Earth carbon dioxide had become carbon stones, on Venus it forms most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel's rally with the Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on ending the fight between the parties for the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Federal Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the German Social Democratic Party for its attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the September rally.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, is concerned about Germany’s reputation and that’s why he demanded that the grand coalition end that fight for the reception of the Dalai Lama.
“In this case we should not present ourselves as a divided nation,” Koehler told the Handelsblatt newspaper.
At the same time, Koehler showed his understanding regarding the reception of the Dalai Lama by Angela Merkel (Party of the Christian Democratic Union) in September.
“Although I have great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are absolutely in force for me,” Koehler said.
Everyone knows that Germany has to act with great equilibrium in terms of foreign policy, the Federal President underlines, defending Merkel for the reproach she received when carrying out a new policy with China.
"The Federal Chancellor did not take the distance from the traditional course of One China policy.
China knows that too,” Koehler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Minister of Foreign Affairs (Social Democratic Party), had indirectly shown his displeasure at the reception of the Dalai Lama and as a result was attacked by members of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticised the Union for its ineffective foreign policy.
The reception of the Dalai Lama at the Federal Chancellery caused great misunderstandings in Sino-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social-Democratic Party), the Minister of Finance of Germany, but also, according to information sources of the magazine "Spiegel", frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministries of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the head of the Chinese government, demanded Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to recognize this reception of the Dalai Lama as a mistake.
Affirming China’s position, Wen Jiabao said China would not accept European politicians receiving the religious leader from the Tibetans in their official position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama showed that he is trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now also includes other provinces.
Schaeuble warns that riots like those in France will occur.
Battles with police on the streets, shootings, car burning: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that riots will occur as was the case in France.
The Federal Minister demands that every effort be made to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not move to the streets.
Barricades were made, vandals fired rifles at the police: after serious riots led by young people in France, the Federal Minister of the Interior, Wolfgang Schaeuble (Party of the Christian Democratic Union) fears similar trends in Germany.
“We must also ensure that the social problems of our country do not take the violent form.”
"We have to take that seriously," he said in the "Neue Presse" newspaper, published in Hannover.
Not all young people are engaged in the constant change of social reality.
The federal state, federal states and municipalities are already working with emphasis to solve these problems, Schaeuble said.
This is not just about the integration of immigrants.
"From the Summit of Integration to the Conference of Islam: all this is already bearing its first fruits."
It's still too early to take for granted the end of the alarm.
At the same time Schaeuble pointed out that German suburbs do not have the same building and sociological problems as they do in France.
The young people were involved in serious riots in the streets with police north of Paris last night.
Cars and public buildings were also burned in Tolouse.
Kenan Kolat, the President of the Turkish Community in Germany, called for greater efforts by the Federal Government for integration.
Kolat, in view of the riots in France, warns of an imitating effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
In spite of everything, actions are necessary.
Kolat said the unemployment rate among young people of foreign origin under the age of 25 is above average.
It is important to ensure that there are more vocational training positions.
Kolat stresses: "We have to give young people a perspective."
The President of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France "there is great social control in families", greater than in the French country.
Moreover, most young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat says: "But despite everything, we have to be careful."
It is necessary to "provide the opportunity for young people to receive a job or vocational training faster".
Meanwhile, the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of policemen took part in the action, a helicopter with headlights flew over the territory.
Authorities reported three arrests, as well as litter and burned cars.
Since the day before, a team of nearly 1,000 policemen has been working on security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Interior Minister, announced that police will take strict measures until it is necessary.
On the night of Monday to Tuesday, about 80 policemen were injured by riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The riots continued the following night in Tolouse.
The riot began in a traffic accident on Sunday, where two young people were killed.
According to information provided by the prosecutor's office, the death of the youth was not the fault of the police.
In the kingdom of Angela Wolke.
The action far from the Federal Chancellor’s reality, shows that the coalition in terms of content has reached its last point and that nothing more can be expected from it.
But in which country does the Chancellor actually live?
After her desperate performance, indifferent and without much content in the general debate of the Lower House, it must be said: she does not live in the country that would have to be governed by her.
As for the reproach that was made to her for having repeatedly engaged in foreign policy performances, the Chancellor rejected it with a presumptuous phrase.
He said that would be a provincial mode and thus showed that he did not want to understand what the critics are interested in.
In the House of Commons, it was very clearly stated to everyone that this rebuke was appropriate.
You could not feel any interest, nor any feeling for the problems of the country.
But instead, Angela Wolke presented herself this way: a very high policy that flees into foreign policy and remains there without achieving anything concrete.
One example: the prevention of climate change: she praised herself very much for the decisions taken at Heiligendamm, but says nothing about how these climate goals should be achieved here.
In general, this way of praising herself – for two years the head of the Party of the Christian Democratic Union has not been able to afford so much modesty.
For he is engaged in expressions so that an impulse may come to the people.
And in this way it damages its public image by the pragmatic conception with which it solves problems without going through the branches.
But in the realm of Angela Wolke inner problems are appearances of little value.
Poverty of children and concerns about low-wage workers?
The only thing that is dedicated is to talk about that topic using subordinate sentences.
It’s impressive how many times you get it wrong when it comes to talking about the supplement for kids.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to be able to formulate a more or less good sentence.
He begins to stumble "as if he had been in an unknown territory", when it came to more concrete information.
The Attacks section.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, clashed in a heated debate of Republican YouTube presidential pre-candidates and must now fear only one candidate from the outside.
Tensions between the candidates have been evident from the outset.
Romney blamed his opponent Rudy Giuliani for turning New York into a “refugee site for illegal immigrants.”
He, for his part, responded with grave reproaches: "I would like to say that his own home was a 'port' for the illegals." Giuliani replies to the former governor of Massachusetts saying that he was the one who employed illegal immigrants without papers.
Candidates tend to attack: as so far the group of Republicans has no clear favorite, the eight presidential pre-candidates take advantage of the debate on CNN, especially to discredit their opponents.
The small 30-second videos, shot by internet users who were uploaded to YouTube, also don’t have much content.
“With this mode of isolation we let Hitler come to power,” that was John McCain’s rebuke to his adversary Ron Paul, the only one at the meeting who insisted on immediately withdrawing troops from Iraq.
Romney also receives much criticism from Vietnam War veterans, when he refuses to recognize as torture "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation, by letting a person drown simulate his death.
Public reactions in the hall in St. Petersburg, Florida, show that in the meantime the most important topics of the campaign are others, not just the war in Iraq or the debates about torture.
The public always applauded very loudly when they praised conservative values and denied raising taxes.
This way you can better see where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
“I was wrong at the time,” Romney said, and apologized to people and the television audience for being an advocate for abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, did not know what to say when asked what he thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time Musharraf ruled without a uniform.
A day after his resignation as army chief, the Pakistani president was sworn in as president.
This is the end of eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
On Thursday, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf took an oath for a second five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the Presidential Palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the constitution and act for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he transferred his mandate as head of the army to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after he came to power with a bloodless military coup, the former general governs the state for the first time as civilian head.
With his resignation as head of the Armed Forces, Musharraf fulfilled the main condition of the opposition and the West.
The other requirement is the end of the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on November 3.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the state attorney general, after the Musharraf oath will very soon cancel the state of emergency and will fulfill the second condition of the West.
Since the proclamation of a state of emergency in the Supreme Court, there have been many pro-Musharraf jurists, and last week the country's Supreme Court rejected all appeals before the controversial new elections of the head of government on October 6.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a military convoy in the northern Watiristan region, five soldiers were killed and four others were wounded.
According to the army spokesman, a bomb exploded on one of the streets on the border with Afghanistan.
The founders of Krautrock are back.
The most famous German band of the 70s continues its activity: three members of "Harmony" participated in a concert in Berlin.
As a re-release a copy of "Live 1974" was made which was written at the best time of the band.
Already at that time they were very famous in foreign countries.
The attendance of these three gentlemen at an official meal caused the sensation.
Each of them has in front of him his box, his cables and above all his buttons.
In the middle is Dieter Moebius, 63, dressed in a white shirt.
To his left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has his laptop and guitar.
To the right, looking from the auditorium, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73, who is very busy with the control panel.
Everyone contributes with their sounds, among them there is even rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
Looks like this doesn't bother the gentlemen.
Something very exciting for Krautrock fans was the fact that the band Harmonia was back to making music.
What needs to be rebelled here is this: the exact questions have shown that the band’s name reverberated in people’s minds, but it wasn’t so special that after 32 years the audience missed it so much.
But why can’t the Germans also applaud their living legend of the seventies?
Especially because the misconception Krautrock was always more valued in England and the United States than in his own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded an "Echo" music award to members of Cologne's Can 2003 band for their life's work, the hall could see the surprised faces of German pop artists.
And when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band La Düsseldorf und Neu!, everyone opened their mouths with astonishment.
Later Michael Rother spent time on stage during the Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as if he had been an old friend (of the band).
Ignorance in your country and recognition abroad are one thing.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the trio only existed for two years and at that time did not achieve a great effect on the audience, however, it later obtained thanks to the others.
A while ago Moebius and Roedelius had made music with artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, which promised much fame.
At first they played in the basement of Berliner Schaubuehne.
Afterwards, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf which was patronized by a church.
For a while, Rother had a job at Kraftwerk and then worked as a guitarist in the band Neu! He managed to improve the fame of this German band that at the time was too radical.
In 1973 Rother followed Cluster musicians into exile at Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a ruin of the 16th century, they lived as refugees from the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in Common I, where Roedelius could complain of his position.
That was rather an artist's life full of surprises.
One day, Ottenstein's Harmony singing association flag appeared in the trash, which turned out to be a good name for the art.
There were also disadvantages in the use of the name Harmony.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonie" and the second "De Lux".
Although the music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as an artist wasn’t just about getting to know yourself.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded during a concert in Griessem. Someone remembers that, in this recording almost 50 people participated.
Then Rother expressed his desire to propel Harmony and do rehearsals from time to time.
For Roedelius and Moebius this demand is against customs.
In 1975, the band announced their separation.
Rother ended up getting into esoteric issues and secured his existence with albums such as "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster revived in the 1980s and has been more successful since then than Harmony.
The live recording of the album in Griessmer, that is to thank Groenemeyer.
His music company Greenland set itself the goal of cultivating this German contribution to preserve it as living music.
Like the work of Roedelius, the band Neu! was also rediscovered.
The presentation of Harmony as a band takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was subsidized with public measures from the Wordtronics festival.
There is Julian Cope, the Englishman, the old punk and the author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
Thus, all of Krautrock’s influences on the following pop music are present.
Harmony takes the position of a super-band, a post that was empty.
Brian Eno’s phrase accompanied by the special music fills the room: “This music is the only true music, the future belongs to it.”
There are pictures where Harmony appears with producers on a farm.
The story of the development of the legend is shown in black and white photo projections, where wired instruments are seen.
In the background there are three veterans who began to improvise again.
They do nothing but attach the microphones to the organ and the battery so that they can produce extraordinary tones with the help of the effects devices they had built with their own hands.
Today, electronic music is just as it should be.
Three people who delve deeper into the technique.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, in a musical atmosphere she coughs, whispers and in a good moment of emphasis sings "Aaaaaaaa!".
Krautrock has always been a term of English origin.
It was never about rock.
The origin of the genre was not sought in blues, but in music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or fleeing artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever here shouts "68!" is also right, but now Harmony remains calm.
On stage, he reflects very well on what is already obvious.
Where does music start and where does it end?
That can break your nerves or give you some quick moments of luck.
Richard Gere only lacks more cynicism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moderischer Frieden" are again dedicated to the war in the Balkans.
But the two of them did not have much conviction.
Either the concepts are too focused on actions and shootings or the two films are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can't help in this case either.
At first there was good news: Karadzic and Mladic, the war criminals, are still hiding in the mountain of the Balkans, but it was there, in the dark interior of the country during the Bosnian war, that actor Richard Gere was rediscovered.
We had finally lost sight of the prettiest man of the eighties, because no one wanted to see him after his pleasant and unimportant roles in women’s films and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most important argument for perhaps watching the movie "The Hunting Party - when a hunter becomes what he chases" (Why today's movie titles have to be so long and crazy?).
The film has a wonderful presentation for the eye: in the background, his role as a reporter in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do, if fate and the film industry had not been so merciful to him. He was a man whose best times of life have already passed, who as a monument of the ruin of his decadence preserved in so far the greatest part of his life.
"The Hunting Party", despite this triumph, along with "Moderischer Frieden" which is the German production and will also be presented this week, turn out to be just a series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
The film "Moderischer Frieden" can be narrated in a nutshell: it is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serb from the snipers of Kosovo, one of them acts very quickly and that also leads him to fall in love with her.
The meaning of the film is lost by the actions and the shootings, although we celebrate that the Serbs are not presented once again as the only culprits.
The film is like the German series "Alarm fuer Cobra 11" without a highway, but in a situation of war.
In the example of "The Hunting Party" one can investigate, because in reality there was never a good film about the war in the Balkans.
At another time, with another director and with another screenwriter (Richard Shepard in two roles), the story about American war reporters who go to detect a war criminal Serb named "Fox", could probably be a new "Apocalypse Now".
Thus, the stories are surprisingly similar: the small teams go to the mountain twice to carry out something that the army can not do and each time it turns out a trip in madness.
One reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when we are introduced to Simon Hunt, who is not allowed to be just a cynic with a heart.
No, the script also foresees a love affair with a Bosnian Muslim who will be killed later.
So "The Hunting Party" is very far from reality, especially when in the last five minutes the reporters achieve with impressive speed what NATO, the CIA and all the headhunters in the world couldn't achieve for five years, which was to capture the war criminal and leave the Bosnian Muslims to avenge themselves in a fair way.
It is so bad, they are eager to appeal to the international court in The Hague based on crimes against cinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is, in fact, a deeply human one.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karad<0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC4><0x87> and Mladi<0xC4><0x87> are still free, and highlights that the Americans and the French are not really concerned about persecuting them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and the bad are so similar, that one comes to mind a very famous poem by Brecht.
In this poem it is a mask of an Asian demon: "In the great wrinkles of his forehead I see, sharing feelings with him, how hard it is to be bad."
In movies like "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons but they show how hard it is to be good.
The problem is not only the genre of war movies in the Balkans.
A newspaper recently reported that all of the films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are fiascos.
It can also be added that there has never been a good film about South Africa.
Almost always worth a rule: when a star gets into a crisis region or minefields, then something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arguette, "Across All Borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Bloody Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio appears.
Possibly all these conflicts occurred in a short space of time.
They have to spend at least decades until Hollywood rolls out a good movie about the holocaust taking as an example the movie "Schindler's List".
Some films already need more time. Classics such as the Vietnam War works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" in their time were not celebrated unanimously as the masterpieces.
Today we may know too much about world conflicts, and that is why in our time every massacre (Massenmord) is presented directly on two televisions at home.
And that’s because screenwriters don’t have the slightest reluctance (which is necessary to be able to) to tell good stories.
“To be or not to be” or “The Great Dictator” turned out to be so good in the end, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still didn’t know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you don't have to be a good person to make a movie.
Perhaps you have to be like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic and distant gaze on an artist.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel Lempri<0xC3><0xA8>re's Dictionary and the war in the Balkans, he replied: "That's only because some things never change."
The great cities will always be in danger, men will always be cruelly murdered and in Yugoslavia there will always be war.
Von Beust received negative criticism of the Olympic Games.
The mayor of Hamburg received a lot of criticism from politics and economics for not applying for the Summer Olympics.
Many want to continue fighting for competitions in the water sports section.
But Beust recalls that you have to be realistic when estimating the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, director general of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, said on Wednesday the resignation was "not good for the economic location".
In recent times no other project in the big city has fostered as much motivation as the idea of organizing the Olympic Games.
“Without this goal, one could not keep the political, sporting momentum at the same level.”
Schmidt-Trenz demanded the Senate not to forget this project, but to find a new long-term application "that refers to another time".
On Wednesday, Mayor Ole von Beust maintained his statements that Hamburg’s ambitions in organizing the Summer Olympics would not be realized until at least 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the application for the Olympic Games, but rather the German Olympic Sports Federation," von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sportbund, which is expected in early December, on Munich’s application for the 2028 Winter Olympics.
“This preference means for us that in this period of time, which until now we thought we would have until 2028, from a realistic point of view we will have no chance at all.”
This dream did not end forever, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regrets von Beut's statements.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympic Games.
“It’s too early to let the opportunity go, if at this point the plans are ruined,” HSB director Günter Plöß said on Wednesday.
A renunciation of the application is contradictory to the statement of the head of the Senate made at a reception on the occasion of the general meeting of the German Public Federation of Sports of Higher Schools (adh).
There von Beust designated Hamburg's application for universities of 2015 not as "a replacement" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week the Sports Federation of Higher Schools nominated Hamburg as a candidate for the application.
The German Social Democratic Party (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion) criticized the Senate for not using such valuable time to build houses in Hamburg.
"For many years the Senate was lagging behind with the development of the small neighborhood of Grasbrook, because this was in plans for the Olympics or the construction of houses," said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, deputies of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD).
While the SPD always required integrated Olympia planning for the small Grasbrook and then the use of the built houses, the CDU underlined the importance of entertainment.
At that time, Hamburg's bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics sparked great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
It's not the wooden boxes.
Whoever relates the terms Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but doesn’t think of Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently the wooden boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow that weighs on Warhol's list of works.
Most of the ninety-four Bright-Box "type" on this list are fake.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" raised doubts about the authenticity of Brillo-Boxes from the year 1968 of Andy Warhol, the museum Moderna Museet in Stockholm carried out internal research and came to disappointing conclusions: the six "Brillio-Boxes", that the former director of the museum Moderna and the museum "Pontus H" are in fact a falcon.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confusing relationship between artistic and sponsored productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Bright-Boxes" in New York, painted the wooden boxes in red, blue and white, with the same sample that they had "Bright" soap powder cartons.
According to Warhol, at the 1968 exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet, hundreds of cardboard boxes were exhibited. These were not made by Warhol (due to expenses), but were brought directly from the "Brillo" cardboard factory.
These were not works of art, but exhibited specimens (which were only objects).
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed to produce wooden boxes in Sweden, but they were not exhibited at the Modern Museum.
Witnesses of those times now speak of almost fifteen boxes, which at that time entered the history of art and auctions as originals of the "Bright-Boxes" of "Stockholm type" authorized by Andy Warhol.
At auctions, some of them were purchased for more than $100,000.
The problem is that after the famous director of the Pontus Hultén museum made false statements that in 1968 in Sweden were produced and exposed almost a hundred of the wooden boxes that Warhol left to him.
But in reality, 105 boxes were produced in the same year in Malmö for Hultén and for the exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By this time Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, the chief curator of the Museum Moderna Museet, investigated six Brillo-Boxes owned by the museum and also three of the Swedish private property that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm. They were first printed and grinded their tight plates and then painted them to oil with the brush.
On the contrary, the structure of the 1990 copies shows that the paint was applied with a roller without directly printing the pressed silvers. In addition, it is not about oil paint, but about acrylic paint.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and must be removed from Andy Warhol's official list of Brilliant-Boxes," says Lars Nittve, director of the Moderna Museet Museum and adds that if the Authentication Commission "Andy Warhol Art" in New York will not come to any conclusion, the Moderna Museet Museums will classify the copies as such.
Already in July the Authentication Commission formally announced that it accepts these “serious allegations” that they are boxes of soap powder.
But from that moment on everything remained in absolute silence.
Rebel soldiers surrender in Manila.
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers have surrendered who had locked themselves in a hotel in Manila and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who blames the president for corruption and electoral fraud, told a reporter he could not answer for shedding blood.
Soldiers loyal to the government had stormed the hotel using tear gas.
Nearly two hundred soldiers had been entrenched in the building for a few hours.
Nearly half of them, including Trillanes, were on trial Thursday for attempting a coup in 2003 that ended in failure.
He took advantage of the negotiations, to suddenly be able to deposit with about 30 sympathizers.
Evidently the military policemen who were to guard him had passed into their ranks and followed their mutiny.
They entered the hotel "Peninsula" and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government troops blocked the neighborhood in the vicinity of the Hotel Noble.
The President called for an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
Norberto Gonzales, the National Security Advisor, condemned the behavior of the soldiers.
“People are tired,” Trillanes said.
“We invite people to come to our ranks.”
General Danilo Lim, who previously led the elite Scout Reangers troop, said that soon the other military troops wanted to continue the march.
Major government critics on Thursday called for a major demonstration against the president.
His government has been accused of corruption for months.
In 2003 the financial district in Manila was a site that attracted all the attention for the riot that was attempted against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after nearly 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven attempted coups against the democratically elected government in the Philippines.
United Internet will be the largest shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet secured more than 20 percent of the shares in telecommunications company Versatel.
On Wednesday, the company reported that the average price for a share is 14.46 euros.
It has only 20.05 percent of the share capital.
There was a lot of speculation about the company’s absorption.
There are also options to further increase the financial part at Versatel.
United Internet reported that with this step it wants to accelerate the consolidation of the German market of DSL (Digital Subscriber Line).
On Wednesday, they already made assumptions about the entry into the business, after the bank Brendenberg increased its stake in the Düsseldorf network operator by 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
In the financial market that means the financial institution maintains equity securities for a third-party partner.
United Internet already on the previous day made participation with almost 10 percent to the telecommunications company Drillisch.
Drillisch in the capital expansion measure placed 17.4 million of the new shares that have a value of 106.4 million euros.
United Internet has bought 5.15 million shares of them for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies started negotiations on DSL-products marketing cooperations.
“We are strengthening our collaboration,” the United Internet spokesman said.
The two companies founded a joint venture MSP, to acquire the competitor Freenet.
On Thursday, United Internet reported that at the start, the two companies want to be happy with the ten percent stake in Freenet and do not make use of their right, i.e. they make 18.49 percent stake in Freenet.
That meant that both companies kept all options, especially the stake in the Freenet company.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This "game" with Freenet that will last for many months and is not very understandable is part of the consolidation of the German market of Telecom.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million with a DSL contract or a full contract.
Until now, the holding company of United Internet and Drillisch had a direct 6.01 percent stake in Freenet.
Then they had agreed that Drillisch would get the other four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas was already agreed in August.
