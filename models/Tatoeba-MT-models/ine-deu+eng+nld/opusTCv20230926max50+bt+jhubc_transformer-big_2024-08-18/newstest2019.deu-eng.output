DFB chief Grindel sees no basis for <0xC3><0x96>zil-Comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for a return of Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil to the national team.
“This is a question that depends, of course, on the fact that one comes into the conversation once, that one also talks to him about why he apparently felt that one or the other, as is stated in his statement,” Grindel said in the football podcast Phrasenmäher of the “Bild-Zeitung”.
Despite the months-long debate over <0xC3><0x96>zil's photos with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of 92-times national player <0xC3><0x96>zil.
"I would have liked Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil to continue playing for Germany.
I also assumed at some point that this would be the case," Grindel said.
The 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and also justified it on the grounds that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostilities during the World Cup.
The DFB chief reiterated his criticism of <0xC3><0x96>zil for not being ready for a conversation with Bundestrainer Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
"He didn't want to put any pressure on us, but he knows it from football, so when you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I'm sorry that this conversation hasn't come to fruition so far."
Linz: Garden hut in Schrebergartensiedlung burned
At 2.13 p.m., the professional fire brigade Linz was alerted to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly over the Schrebergartensiedlung, danger was in delay.
The professional fire brigade moved out and found the hut in full fire when they arrived.
The roof had to be removed practically in its entirety and fire extinguishers removed to the extent strictly necessary.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had plugged a battery for charging at noon.
This could possibly be the cause of the fire.
In any case, according to the fire department, the charger was in the range of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire has yet to be determined, as well as the cause of the fire.
However, it may be considerable, because the owner had many collectors in his garden hut.
Angry mother defends herself: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on open road
What did Lindsay Lohan only do to this extremely strange action?
She apparently wanted to take away the children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has even streamed live how she apparently wants to kidnap a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial section of the stream.
"Fortunately Kissed" with Lindsay Lohan
The clip shows Lohan getting out of a car and going to a possibly homeless family that she wants to make out as a refugee family from Syria.
As the family flees from the actress, Lohan pursues the parents and their children.
She accuses the adults of trafficking children.
For all this she does not provide any evidence in the clip.
"The whole world is watching this right now," Lohan is seen in the video as she continues to follow the family along the street.
Apparently, she is trying to separate the children from their parents.
At some point, however, it seems to be enough for the obviously angry mother.
It looks like she turns around and Lohan misses an earring.
Under tears, the actress controls how shocked she is - and she holds her cheek.
What prompted Lohan to take this action is completely unclear at the moment.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The probe "Hayabusa2" launched in December 2014 in Japan.
It is said to be so close to the asteroid Ryugu that it can suck in material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The lander "Mascot" will stay on Ryugu.
Foreign ticker: Death toll in Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of magnitude 7.5 and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 420 people have died.
The number of victims could rise even further.
The rescue teams have not yet penetrated into the devastated and cut off areas of the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as chief executive officer of Tesla
In the beginning was a tweet.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk caused an uproar in the stock markets in early August when he announced a withdrawal of the electric car manufacturer.
The U.S. stock market supervisor sued him for fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the head of Tesla withdraws from the board of directors, but he is allowed to remain chairman.
Conservative Party of the United Kingdom
Sharply guarded - the Tories' party congress
Birmingham becomes the scene of a power struggle.
The congress is supposed to be about foreign policy, trade issues and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, at the front of former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a new state name
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing over these name doublings for years.
Now they have agreed.
The state of Macedonia is supposed to be called North Macedonia in the future and the population will vote on it this Sunday - is it okay?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populist Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The Not") - meant by Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest against right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The “Trump of Brazil” is an anti-system candidate and is at the forefront of the polls.
His fiercest rival is Fernando Haddad of the Workers’ Left Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" rework takes longer than planned
“The diesel task force is still there,” Peter Mertens, chief development officer, told Automotive Week.
Audi CEO Rupert Stadler announced in December 2017 that the task force would soon be disbanded.
“In the first quarter of 2018, all engine/gear combinations are expected to be tested,” he said at the time.
Mertens said: “At the beginning of July we achieved an important milestone in the recovery of the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analysis of our VTDI engines.
The Task Force was established in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at the Audi parent company Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the automaker had made "grave organizational changes" so that such a scandal would never happen again.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler’s future on Friday and wants to discuss further on Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the Audi chief of having allowed the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust values after the exhaust gas frauds became known.
In doing so, he knew about the manipulations or consciously ignored them.
Currently, Bram Schot, Chief Sales Officer, manages the company as Chief Executive Officer.
Due to the switch to the new exhaust and consumption test standard WLTP, there are production failures at Audi, said Schot the "Heilbronner Stimme".
In principle, he sees a decreasing demand for limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
“The segment itself is difficult,” he said.
Scots relies on electromobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, there are already 15,000 reservations.
Grindel aspires to re-election - Lahm to be president of DFB
Mainz (dpa) - Despite criticism of his person after the World Cup and the <0xC3><0x96>zil affair, Reinhard Grindel wants to run again for the office as DFB president next year.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as possible," Grindel said as a guest early Sunday morning at ZDF's "Current Sports Studio".
You have to try to re-election again and again, and I will.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
In his own words, the head of the association would find it "remarkable" if, after the contract for the 2024 European Football Championship, he did not "want to collaborate on the project of the future".
Grindel has been the head of the association since April 2016 as a successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who was overthrown over the summer fairy tale affair.
In the autumn of 2016, he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will take place at the DFB Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future EM chief organizer Philipp Lahm is to work in the DFB Presidency.
"I would be delighted if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that he will be consulted in this role in the Bureau in the future and then of course be cordially invited to provide his experience on sporting matters," Grindel said.
He did not want to participate in speculations about whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB chief.
As a consequence of the affair around the photos of Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in the future a national player without a migration background should become an integration ambassador of the DFB.
Currently, this office is exercised by the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter has family roots in Cameroon.
“If someone without a migration background is clearly influencing society and football and says, ‘The issue is important, then we have to take care of it,’ that would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our clubs on the ground where integration needs to work,” Grindel said.
Proper weight loss with half-smart scales
I have had a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that not only measures my weight, but also my body fat percentage.
Muscle and bone mass can also show them.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but it is more for the sausage.
I don’t know if I’ve replaced fat with muscle.
Basketball Bundesliga: clear opening sequence for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin has started the new season of the Bundesliga with a clear victory.
Against Science City Jena, the vice-champion won easily with 112:55 (52:31) and offered a convincing game over 40 minutes.
Rokas Giedraitis was the top scorer of the dominant Berliners with 20 points.
National player Johannes Thiemann (18 counters), who is committed from Ludwigsburg, also showed an appealing performance in front of 9113 spectators during his compulsory play debut.
Former champion Brose Bamberg won 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the best pitcher among the guests with 24 points.
Würzburg-Profi Gabriel Olaseni came on 14 counters.
Last year's playoff semi-finalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg defeated the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt with 83:76 (41:34).
New national player Karim Jallow was with 24 points the safest shooter in the team of coach John Patrick.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a clear success.
At the basketball Löwen Braunschweig there was a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new player Will Cummings surpassed the Oldenburgers with 25 counters.
The Braunschweiger, with NBA star Dennis Schröder as majority owner since the start of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 run of the basketballs quickly ensured clear conditions.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an called on the German government to extradite supporters of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens - no matter where they live.
We will not allow supporters of the PKK or the Gülen movement to shake up our citizens and harm German-Turkish friendship,” he said.
For the opening of the Ditib Mosque, the Cologne city centre had been partially closed.
Thousands of police officers were on duty, including snipers.
The Islamist group Ditib has been criticized for being an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music Against Poverty: Stars, Cries and Horror
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have been promoting more engagement in the fight against poverty and disease at a concert in New York’s Central Park.
"Get involved wherever you can," Mendes said at the festival on Sunday night in front of around 60,0000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, this is a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with fringes and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organizations also appeared on stage at the multi-hour spectacle.
In the meantime, however, there was a moment of horror when many spectators thought the sound of a falling metal barrier was shooting, got scared and tried to escape.
Shortly there was panic, people ran into confusion.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, organizer Hugh Evans said.
The New York police and musician Chris Martin then reassured the people from the stage.
“No one is trying to hurt anyone,” Martin said.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge on the Internet as every year.
Anyone who wanted to catch one had to read and spread on the Internet texts, photos and videos about the global fight against poverty and diseases.
For the numerous musicians and actors there were cheers and applause from the audience - cheers on the other hand for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
He, along with his Democratic colleague Chris Coons, spoke out on the stage for more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had spoken out in the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge on the Supreme Court, knocking many women in the face.
At least three women have raised allegations of abuse, including attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which Kavanaugh denies.
Flake called for an FBI investigation into the allegations after he was confronted by two women who reportedly experienced sexual assault themselves on their way to the committee meeting in an elevator.
"You can also come with me in an elevator at any time," Flake told the crowd at the concert in New York.
Press Freedom: Federal Government Defends Journalist’s Draft
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert defended the eviction of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an.
In the Chancellery, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had put on a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone to the front row.
The T-shirt, if not the problem, Seibert said the picture on Sunday.
It was a disturbance in the course of the press conference.
The action of the journalist caused a strong unrest, which was not acceptable.
He has caused the man to be taken out by personal protectors.
Seibert said that it is not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This applies completely regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
There are many journalists in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage or support or membership in banned parties or the Fethullah-Gulen movement.
The Turkish leadership blames the movement for the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists are facing several decades in prison.
Even foreign journalists are not safe in front of the Turkish authorities: It wasn’t until early September that the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Recently, the cases of the imprisoned journalists Me<0xC5><0x9F>ale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had caused a stir.
They were released and were able to return to Germany, but trials against the two are still ongoing in Turkey.
Munich: Florian David Fitz drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him so freshly and visually: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look twice: Yes, this is really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht" produced by the NDR is known for moist conversations at the counter of the Hamburger Hafenkneipe "Schellfischposten".
Moderator Ina Müller and her guests come across some beer, some wine or even higher percentage drinks to relax the mood and tongues.
Not a few celebrities also have the courage to take part in the mandatory singing sessions.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time with the actor Florian David Fitz known from films such as "Men's Hearts", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Hottest Day".
But the trip to the high north was not good for the Münchner.
On Saturday, he posted a selfie - his face is completely numb on it, his eyes only two small slits.
The bed selfie shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he is not sick, he only has a powerful caterpillar.
Addressing his fans, he posted some - probably not very serious - findings that he has now won: "Rule one: NEVER go to Ina's night.
Rule two: Never drink the black sauce.
And a syringe.
And the round of egg liqueur, which Ina throws at half past three, also leaves.
The 43-year-old’s alcohol consumption is written on his face.
His fans immediately posted a few tips for fighting the aftermath.
They ranged from instant broth, fish rolls or - probably the most targeted - headache tablets.
Others simply amused themselves at the sight of the normally attractive cinema star.
It is not yet known how Ina Müller survived the night stand.
But since she has been moderating the TV fun at the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more tested...
A beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa struggles with vandalism and vice
The entrance to the 36-kilometre-long cycle path in the Red Riding Hood Country in Treysa is difficult to find and spoilt.
Recipes against the grassy vandalism are sought, but solutions hardly stand out.
Scissors, cigarette butts, garbage and dirt, demolished garbage bins and now dismantled signposts - this is how the entrance to the bike path on the Haase hill in Treysa has been presented for a long time.
For the display object Rail bike path in the Red Riding Hood country a more than rude sight.
Members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt and others have been working on the topic for a long time, according to the city’s cycling commissioner Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem has already been addressed in the Cycling Council.
There is no solution so far.
The proposals ranged from the relocation of the seating group to the regular emptying of the waste containers and cleaning of the areas at the point of entry.
"I think the latter would be the command of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the topic has also been brought to the local council.
It’s not just the trash that drives cyclists and locals around – the seating group is a regular meeting point for celebration on weekends.
Not only does it often happen loudly, in the case of the beds it is also destroyed: posts are torn from the ground, garbage cans are demolished, signs are bent over, seating furniture is smeared.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions are only the proverbial drops on the hot stone.
They are annoyed that the resting place on the bike path in Treysa is a meeting point for surcharges.
"All along the cycle path, the focus is clearly on the Haaße hill," confirms the cycling commissioner, who now also cares about the new cycling site in Ziegenhain, which will be opened today.
"If they suffer the same fate, it becomes really expensive".
Another idea is a video surveillance on the hill: "Perhaps this puts the threshold much higher to engage in community property.
This would, however, presuppose that a police strip would then pass in a timely manner.
In principle, Wüstenhagen wants a development of the Hate Hill.
It needs to be made more attractive.
With the frequentation of the cycle path so far, one can be very satisfied.
The tourist marketing is still expandable.
Our bike path is of very high quality compared to others in Germany," said the ADFC members.
As an extremely critical danger point, ADFC member Susanne Klippert assesses the situation in the Asheroder Straße in Treysa.
There is no turn-off track on the Haase Hill.
In the event of heavy traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between traffic flows on both sides,” she explains.
This is not a problem for sporty drivers, but probably for the elderly and especially for children.
Music competition at the Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and in common.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the district offensive Hiltrup, in the "music contest for large and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with winks in the sympathetic helper family", as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a family gathering for coffee and cake from the volunteers of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven bands joined, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long-lived in Hiltrup living Albachten, the nine of the "Hilfstrupper Sternfarben", three members and three generations of the children's ensemble We the Trenkamp and Ensemble.
This contest, said district mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We have not seen this in other parts of the city.
What did the writers look like?
In the villages, the Hiltruper See and the Marktallee were mentioned particularly frequently.
Rolf Ihmig named the alley in his hit song "Kö von Hiltrup".
The cultural centre was also appreciated.
Again and again it was about experiencing each other in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short pauses with short interviews with the interpreters or hints about their work.
This is how Humberg learned that he actually studied chemistry, but now also teaches guitar.
From the sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann, Franke knew to report that he had recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest on the program.
And Alvin Jasic has posted all sorts of things on YouTube.
“It’s not about winning,” Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hilfstruper Gastronomie.
However, there was something special about the jury’s favorites – so that others could hear their songs.
An entire CD can be recorded by Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Imhmig with his Hiltrup drummer, who impressed Franke especially with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone else, the children reappeared in the final – and sounded “very good” even without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, receptivity of the melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Wirtschaftsverband and Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive had brought the event to life on the occasion of its ten-year existence.
She saw the event as a complete success.
All are "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very crowded cultural train station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams facing each other.
For each page, there is a screen, including four cards with keywords that you can decipher - the old trick with the red foil - only when you have inserted them.
This ensures that the other side cannot read anything by accident.
On the maps, for example, read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2. Window.
3. Cube.
4. Fest".
These are the terms that need to be encrypted from now on.
It is not the terms that are supposed to be guessed, but the codes.
Alternately, one player per team is the encryptor.
He gets a code card that might have "3.4.2." on it.
Guess in "Decrypto" not the terms behind the secret foil, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: He should describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "cubes", "party" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team as possible does not; because this wins the game if he manages to crack the code twice.
So the encryptor notes and reads out loud: "Throw" for the cubes, "loose" as opposed to festive; here, of course, something like "party" and "prag" would also be possible because he took care of the school and knows the window crash there.
This is how it goes round for round, team for team.
Although you do not know the terms of the opposite - but this can be better combined with every hint that the encryptor gives there.
The rewrites should be as mysterious as possible, but not too averted, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
The most cryptic thing about "Decrypto" is unfortunately the rule booklet.
The players will probably have to study it for quite a long time and in detail until they can finally play.
The explanation video at decrypto.info on the net makes it easier.
But anyone who has just started will be fascinated by how much feeling is in this unobtrusive game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as predecessors and genre-primus "Codenames", which also uses an agent theme on a game of fewer words, but for this it is much better to play in small groups.
And if it’s just about rates and not about victory points, he can easily invent a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler greeting and harasses guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the Kulmbach police inspectorate twice in the night from Saturday to Sunday.
He first showed Hitler's greeting in the Upper City of a passing police strip, then later he also appeared in the Upper City in a pub when he harassed other guests.
After he did not comply with the place reference given by the police, he had to spend the night at the police inspection Kulmbach in the prison cell.
In a sober state, he must then also be held criminally liable for the use of signs of unconstitutional organizations.
Pressig was home to the Schubloks
The railway plant in Pressig was the turning point in the Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers burst, you heard it in a very pressing way," recalls Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
That didn't upset anyone.
The brakes were still and the wagons were crumbling.
It was a pure railway.
Statements that symbolize Dinkel's homeland are pressing.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was such a place shaped by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the Steilrampen-mountain route to the north, which has its peak in Steinbach am Wald after an increase of about 220 meters.
To cope with this, train and push blocks were previously needed, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway workshop with 21 locomotives, an apprenticeship workshop, a pipeline and a master train.
"The heart piece was the turntable, which after a reconstruction in 1899 had a diameter of 18 meters," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, a railway historian and professional railwayman for 47 years.
From the BW Pressig railway station, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, locomotives were also operated for the pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben side routes.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight Elloks were then stationed in Pressig.
The electrification of the line in 1939 already minimized the need for train and push blocks.
From 1977 they were only used in freight trains.
By 1991, at least 10,000 weights were still ranked per month.
Parts of the plant were discontinued in 1982 and the rest in 1991.
Heidrich: "It is unfortunate that no better use of the site has been made, including in terms of freight transport."
Even at Pentecost 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated a pompous station festival in Pressig for the anniversary of "50 Years of Electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld".
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," Georg Dinkel recalls.
A little later that off.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, the Rangierbahnhof Pressig was history.
"The rangers and shoemakers did the most difficult work in train traffic," Dinkel recalls.
Any mistake would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station Pressig-Rothenkirchen has led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current images can be found here in the frunkenPlus article.
Kerber with success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round at the tennis tournament in Beijing like Julia Görges before.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the world ranking third is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or the Spaniard Carla Su<0xC3><0xA1>rez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6:3, 4:2 against Darya Kassatkina when the Russian placed at number 13 gave up.
The swan now gets to do with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
As part of the series "Art and pleasure", a special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach this weekend.
With great relief, registered organizers and visitors saw the ideal weather when the Special Vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the open air of the property Dahlmann- Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the roof of the tourism association "Rund ums Walberla" as part of the series "Art and pleasure".
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
The fascination of the exhibition proved to be a great visitor attraction.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be visited in Mittelehrenbach.
Hausherr Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the Vernissage.
He has been there himself since the first hour.
As well as Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist.
Surprisingly, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he put his task in proven, young hands with good future prospects.
In the past, both have actively participated in the selection of artists and have co-designed flyers.
Also this year, on the occasion of Kunst & Genuss, there is again a 70-cent special stamp designed by them, available at each art station.
This year's poster "Betzn ausstanzen" designed by Volker Hahn can also be purchased there for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the high praise of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg was selected for the musical setting.
When walking through the spacious garden, the visitor quickly realizes that the title "Windspiel-Performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it playfully.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramic, often with colored accents.
Already at the entrance of the property, the visitor is waiting on the right side of the "Glücksbaum" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a stump, brightly colored, playful with 20 windmills, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminum tubes as a piece of sound.
With the sun shining through the bushwork in the background, the object seems fairy-tale-like and invites you to linger.
From Eckental comes Barbara Waschneck, who prefers to dedicate herself in three-dimensional letters to the event 15 years K&G.
There are many parts, in the wind in motion.
Halfway through, Siegrid Frey from Eckental has exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colorful fantasy structures made of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Windspiel-Performance" for strolling through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited until 31 December 2018.
50 years MGV 68 albatross: singers celebrate 50th birthday
1968 - this was the time of the protest and the student movement.
And the Albanians, too, at that time, breathed their displeasure.
At least five of them.
They everywhere did not want to find themselves with the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir "Caecilia" there should be no more singing life in the district.
It has now become a legend: at a bank in the tin bush, they lifted the MGV 68 albatross from the baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated big in the "House of Encounter".
"It's going to be full today," said Chairman Jürgen Holststiege, and he should be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albanian singers.
Especially for the anniversary, they had revived the foundation festival.
For years it was a tradition, then there was a break.
In time for the 50th anniversary, the traditional festival was back.
An elegant ball it had been asked to festive clothes before.
The guests did not sit in rows in the "House of Encounter" as usual, but comfortably at tables.
In the meantime, movement was on: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln put on the controls and asked for the dance floor.
Honor that the singers of the MGV 68 bassoons themselves sounded the voice.
For the occasion, happy songs were performed.
Almost put: "Such a day, as beautiful as today".
According to the exquisite grape juice that many had before them, there was the "Rüdesheimer Wein".
In reference to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus" sounded, which is the Latin name for "hope".
Again sovereign was the choral leadership of Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were in the tin bush at the time.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," said Holsstiege, "he has such an easy way, it's a mastery he does." By the way, this time, not only men presented themselves singingly.
The women's choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire mainly includes evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.
Finally, there was poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had sat at the desk until three in the morning to create his own rhymes.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented well-sounding poetry.
There was also a big tombola.
With the proceeds, the children of the Albatros Youth Center will be financed a visit to the all-weather zoo.

Volleyball: 3rd League Women: USC II wins high-class derby against BW Aasee
The climber is marching.
Three games, three victories - the reserve of the USC Münster under the auspices of Axel Büring is really good in League Three.
No sign of shyness or freckles, the independents do their thing.
And that at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city rival BW Aasee really good.
“It wasn’t crystal clear, but we’ve already made an impression,” says the rather satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately added: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
We are not dissatisfied." On the contrary.
In the evening at a subsequent birthday party of Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game was cut off.
Yes, the result is in fact an optical deception.
In the third set, the guests had a set ball.
"When they get to the finish line, a game like this can turn upside down," Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally, the USC cleared everything with its routine forces and brought the full harvest to the finish line.
“We all know who is on the other side in a derby like that.
It doesn't break our necks.
I’ve seen really good volleyball in phases,” Annacker hadn’t scored with the 0:3 – and immediately moved on to the agenda.
Where the trip goes for the Independents, after just three days of play seems unpredictable.
“It’s just too early for that,” says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The 3rd league has an incredibly good level.
This is not nearly comparable to regional league volleyball." In the fourth league, they no longer want to look down.
If the vest is not polluted in the next few weeks, you need to look up.
However, a first balance can only be drawn after ten, eleven games.
On Saturday we go to Emlichheim.
Aasee will take part in Essen on 14 October.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "dream ship" Heide Keller became a star.
Now she speaks openly that the series may have been a part of her marriage to Hans von Borsody.
Her role as Chief Hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "Dream Ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 01, 2018, she left for good.
The series that made her a star could be co-responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
“That could also have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled with a suitcase alone around the world and many colleagues admired by me took me to eye level," says Keller in conversation with the "Image on Sunday".
At first, she had always been "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that changed with the "dream ship".
Because now the journalists only called Heide Keller.
"If he liked it so much, I don't know."
She believes it is possible that her husband at the time might have been quite jealous, but "how many men also shook up his conversations about problems and feelings."
Keller has always tried to be the only one for Hans von Borsody, and he didn’t want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I’ve moved,” she further explains.
She always felt like she wasn’t good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman who I never really was, even though I sometimes appeared rude and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever.”
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes again, "although I was afraid it might go wrong a second time."
The day before the official wedding, I was crying in the wardrobe and wanted to cancel everything.
Borsody's marriage also failed.
Why did it never work out with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller introduced himself to love at the time "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not everyday.
I was too naive about love."
The nightfolder, who regularly explores the nightlife of the city in the NZZ-Resort Zurich, has this time dared to attend the ZFF opening party.
Our fold is not a moth, but still a bit light shy.
And the gritty shine, in which a green carpet is immersed on the Sechselautenplatz, dazzles him over charge.
But it’s just film festival, where more or less famous people want to sunbathe in the spotlight.
On this late Thursday night, he wanders over the square to relax in the "Aquaclean-WC-Oase" for a short while.
This is the name of the public toilet facility, sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival: the needs facility on the ground floor of a new pavilion is making a lot of effort to diffuse a luxurious ambience.
This evening, however, it smells like heaven in the men's oasis for some reason.
So get out here, across the street: Invited guests, who have been entertaining at the cinema next to the opening film "Green Book" at the best level, celebrate the beginning of the festival with a party in the three-storey department store, as every year.
Its name fits perfectly to this film festival: From all over the globe, the works shown are known to originate.
What do you have to think about in an article about this festival in order not to fall into the trap of advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The folder is bound by a ribbon around the sensors that has stuck a good fairy in it, and two bubbly doorposts actually wave it generously in.
Inside, the guests push themselves, they dance long after midnight to live music or let themselves be dictated by DJ rhythms, to which they shout at each other, and rinse exquisite snacks down with cupli.
In the delicatessen shop in the basement, oysters are waiting for sniffing mouths, next to the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut, a chocolate fountain is splashing.
And the hammer is: all the sales shelves full of exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without major losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The folder studies the sign at the escalator: "Wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If these are two separate instructions, he has lost himself in the dress code.
But it's more of a conditional construction, and it's certainly already saved lives.
In the household goods department on the upper floor, the poultry cuts a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye", suitable for the festival award.
The prize for the best drink is not necessarily given to this mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself.
And George Clooney, who has been advertising for that brand for years, is not here that evening either.
But between local prominence, box office and kitchen items, a face that seems familiar to the observer passes by: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His main character shouldn’t be far off.
And really: immediately Viggo Mortensen, with soon sixty almost like a chorus, walks through the crowd.
He is not squatted, not gifted, one hides at most.
Especially for this restraint, often misunderstood as clamping, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbia dance
Former coach and football star Diego Maradona is delighted with his team’s victory.
Argentinian football legend Diego Maradona seems to have lived well in his new home, Mexico.
After a 2-0 win by his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the cabin to Cumbia rhythms, as seen in a video already released on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in a yellow jersey, lit by the players.
The Mexican second-tier had beaten the Leones Negros 2-0 on Saturday.
After the game, Maradona called in a TV camera "Always with my boys, always".
The 57-year-old has been coaching the Mexican club since the beginning of September.
Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV Send after last-minute failure "destroyed on the ground"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball league ASV Send, could hardly believe: "So a bitter defeat". His defenders were "devastated on the ground" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - bankruptcy - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.
They had, as in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst, not played badly over wide phases, the Sendener.
Only the initial phase "we are totally asleep," the ASV coach was annoyed.
The housekeepers quickly led by 8:1, even the early break that Bieletzki had taken did not at first bear fruit.
"But then all of a sudden there was a rush through the team," Bieletzki summed up the second quarter hour.
For the break, the gap was only two more goals.
Especially Senden’s best, Marius Hintze, met in the stage one by one.
After the change it became even better from the visitor's point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst finished at 15:15, after which the season changer led almost continuously.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still three seemingly soothing hits (29:26).
What's next?
Take the unbiased into action.
Bieletzki is usually careful not to blame others.
But: The 120-second time penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff cashed was "a joke".
LIT had a good laugh and hit four more times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, also stood well against seven men in the back and repeatedly threw on the empty goal.
You can only buy little for the compliments.
"Now a damned victory must come," said the fully-serviced Bieletzki.
ASV goals: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hüging (1).
Bavaria: Woman missing for 30 years - Police dig for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an 18-year-old girl from Naila (Landkreis Hof) the police are searching for the remains of the woman.
On Saturday, forces dug up a street near Marxgrün.
For this purpose, the road surface and several layers below it were removed, as the police and the prosecutor's office communicated together.
According to new findings, the missing woman may not have been buried far away from her then-residential home.
The woman has been missing since November 4, 1986.
Investigators did not rule out a crime at the time.
Since last year, the Criminal Police Court, together with the Prosecutor’s Office, is working on the case again intensively.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Monumental Protection Authority, the investigators encountered a bump under the street near Marxgrün by means of a ground radar.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officers limited the place to a few meters.
The results of the excavations should be announced in the afternoon.

Elon Musk, founder of electric car maker Tesla, has abdicated his impending resignation as head of the billion-dollar company.
He and the SEC extrajudicially filed a lawsuit over misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla each pay $20 million, and Musk also resigns for three years as chairman, a position comparable to the German supervisory board chairman.
The Chief Executive is allowed to remain against it.
In the comparison, which still needs to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted misconduct.
The SEC had sued the world-renowned manager in the U.S. federal court in Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who also heads space firm SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-making electric car pioneer, now valued at more than $50 billion on the stock exchange.
Musk is not to blame.
Musk said he had done nothing wrong and was saddened and disappointed by the lawsuit.
He has always acted in the spirit of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk had written to his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take the company off the stock market and pay $420 per share, the funding being secured.
Tesla would have been valued at $72 billion in total.
Later, Musk ruddered back: Tesla remained on the stock exchange.
After the deal, Tesla now has to find an outside chairman, hire two independent board members, and also set up a committee that oversees Musk’s communications.
Football: Sturridge saves Liverpool: Klopp team 1-1 at FC Chelsea
Liverpool scored a 1-1 win over Chelsea.

After six wins at the start, Liverpool fell back to second place.
Chelsea remain third, new top rider is Manchester City.
Eden Hazard led Chelsea in the 25th minute with his sixth goal of the season.
After that, the Klopp team missed the balance several times.
National player Antonio Rüdiger clarified after a solo from Liverpool goalkeeper Mohamed Salah on the line (31st).
Shortly before the end, Sturridge rescued the Reds with a slingshot in the corner.
Manchester United are slipping deeper and deeper into the crisis after the worst start of the season since 1989.
The team of the controversial coach José Mourinho lost at West Ham United earning 1:3 (0:2) and remains with ten points after seven days in the middle of the table only.
The pressure on Mourinho will continue to grow ahead of the Champions League match on Tuesday against FC Valencia.
The former Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno came to his first Premier League deployment after an injury by Petr Cech.
Before the Champions League game at 1899 Hoffenheim on Tuesday, Manchester City won by goals from Raheem Sterling (29th) and Sergio Agüero (65th) 2:0 against Brighton&Hove Albion.
Leroy Sané prepared the 1-0, Ilkay Gündogan was not used in the new top rider.

Polls: 46 percent do not want Merkel to be chancellor by 2021
After the squabbles of the past few weeks, GroKo has received several deep-seated polls.
The SPD falls back in a poll behind the AfD - Angela Merkel is seen critically.
The AfD has overtaken the SPD in the Emnid Sunday trend for the picture on Sunday nationwide for the first time.
In the weekly poll of the opinion research institute, the AfD adds a counter to 17 percent, the SPD gives a point compared to the previous week and lands at 16 percent.
The CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only reach 27 percent.
This is the lowest value to date for the Union in the Sunday trend.
The Greens reach 15 percent, the Left 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
If the federal elections were held on Sunday, the ruling parties SPD, CDU and CSU would get only 43 percent of the vote, according to Emnid.
With this, the grand coalition has currently lost the majority in the Sunday question at all major research institutes - with the exception of Allensbach.
The ruling parties consistently get 43 to 45 percent of the vote (Allensbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 Bundestag elections, they received 53.4 percent.
Among the other parties, the range is also large: the AfD, in several polls the second-strongest party, comes to 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens reach 12.5 to 17 percent of the vote.
The left is 10 percent on average, while the FDP is 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, depending on the percentage of votes, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent upwards and downwards.
But also the support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has fallen significantly since the 2017 Bundestag elections.
At the moment, only 48 percent of the citizens think that Merkel is the right person in the chancellor’s office, as the Emnid survey on behalf of the BamS showed.
According to the survey, only one in two (50 percent) currently wants the grand coalition to hold until the next regular federal election in three years, 41 percent are in favor of a new election.
Also in a further poll published on Saturday, there had been clear declines in popularity for Merkel.
Divided, the Germans are also assessing whether Merkel should run for the CDU presidency again in December.
According to Emnid, 47% are in favour of it, 44% are against it.
Accordingly, 64% of Union supporters want a candidacy, 35% do not.
Exhaustion at Aldi: Price reduced to love happiness
Is Aldi going to be Tinder 2.0?
Who says that in Tinder times there are no more romantic acquaintance stories - he should talk to Aldi about turkey once.
Munich - In times of digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket radiates almost an anachronistic romance as a place to get to know the great love.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxer shorts at the hot table or the favorite pudding is still a better story for the later grandchildren than a simple swipe to the right.
The Tinder app is in the name of being less of a contact, but rather a slippery exchange.
We dared the test: How do women react when you don’t talk about the hot breed for a long time in the first message?
Here is the amazing result.
Regular Hollywood love story potential has it when love happiness precedes an out-of-the-eyes-lost-and-recovered plot.
If the guy is still contacting his worshiper at the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch<0x40>gmx.de, then that sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and consorts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is the author of this ad in an Aldi branch unknown to us quite to wish that she will also find her dream man, with whom she spoke briefly about the "30 percent reduced organic putten meat".
For her belief in the magic of analog learning, she definitely deserved her Happy End <0xC3><0xA0> la Hollywood.
Billerbeck: 500 lids for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludgeri School has been participating in the action "Cover against polio - 500 covers for a life without paralysis".
Polio is the abbreviation for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by polioviruses.
The disease known in German as paediatric paralysis leads from paralysis to death.
In Germany, polio is considered eradicated, but there are still three countries worldwide where the disease occurs.
The cause of poliomyelitis, the polioviruses, can so far only be contained by vaccinations, as a press release says.
Football: Reus and Zorc demand peace for idols
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB sports director Michael Zorc and captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public discussion on the form and fitness of Mario Götze.
“We should stop worrying about Mario.
That doesn't do the boy any good.
And that doesn’t do us any good,” Reus, a friend of Götze’s, told Sky after the 4:2 victory in Leverkusen.
Zorc had already emphasized before the game.
This is not an easy situation for him personally.
Football: Eberl: No rush in contract talks with hecking
Mönchengladbach (dpa) - Manager Max Eberl of Borussia Mönchengladbach does not see a rush to a possible contract extension with coach Dieter Hecking.

There is no fixed date when we will do this.
"But there will certainly be the moment when we sit down and talk," Eberl told Sky on Sunday night.
Football: Bezirksliga: VfL Wolbeck's researcher's appearance against SC Altenrheine gives courage
There were moments in this still young season when Alois Fetsch went to court hard with his own.
Wortkarg, the coach of the football district league player VfL Wolbeck, he first withdrew (inside) to reflect on the lack of willingness to perform on the green.
All history.
In the meantime, it runs again around the Brandhoveweg.
Baptismal evidence is the 1:1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrheine, in the past season only thinly scraped past the ascent.
Yes, I am very pleased with the performance.
“We tightened the spaces and put pressure on the ball.
That could be seen," fetsch praised his boys and looked up to each individual after the game to simply say "thank you" for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to change the system after 26 minutes.
After the injury to Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - it went from the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes waited in front for balls.
Wolbeck had significantly more games in the first leg.
And chances.
But Frerichs before his exit (17th), the substitute Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
It almost took revenge when the SCA beat up Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer twice in person in 41 minutes dangerously in front of the Wolbecker box - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his profession.
After the break, the VfL took full control.
Thewes from 18 meters barely failed.
Schroer also came too late after 58 minutes at a Thewes re-entry.
With the change of Miles Geske, Fetsch on the left again missed a fresh cell cure.
When Old Rhine's Chris Naberbaumer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, there was an indirect free kick for the placeholders 18 meters in front of the guest housing.
The fouled man himself stepped in and demonstrated his peril at standards.
Westhues" Ding with the right slug struck down left from the shooter's point of view - 1:0 (71.).
20 minutes left, which should be damned long.
And then this: VfL captain Florian Quabeck accidentally flew the leather into his hand in the 80th minute in the penalty area.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79.).
Bange minutes Wolbeck had to survive in the final phase, before Geske still had the victory hit in the 87th minute from twelve meters.
It might have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th Geske) - Thewes

Helicopter crashed in Kottingbrunn
At the landing, there was an accident on the airfield.
The four inmates were slightly injured.
At around 2 p.m. on Sunday at the airport in Kottingbrunn there was a drama.
The landing of a helicopter caused turbulence, as confirmed by the police against oe24.
The helicopter was caught by a gust of wind, rushed to the ground and came to the side to lie down.
Police, rescue and firefighters were immediately informed.
With a large order, the forces arrived at the scene of the accident.
The <0xC3><0x96>AMTC emergency helicopter was also called for caution.
Inmates only slightly injured
Fortunately, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There is only one damage.
The four inmates were only slightly injured and were able to return home on their own.
The exact circumstances of the accident have not yet been clarified and are the subject of investigations.
According to fire spokesman Franz Resperger, there was a small fire of origin, which, however, could be quickly erased again.
Report of the Allbright Foundation: Women remain a rarity in corporate boards
As a result, only 8 percent of the board members were women on the 1st of September, according to the report "The Power of Monoculture", which is officially presented on Monday by the Allbright Foundation and presented to the German Press Agency in advance.
“The companies will have to be different, otherwise the international competitors will pull past them,” said Wiebke Ankersen, managing director of the foundation.
In the United States, the United Kingdom or Sweden, male-only leadership teams are no longer imaginable, with a few exceptions.
The backlog makes the German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented in comparison.
It is a different corporate culture.
The slight increase in the share of women among the German stock exchange companies is also due solely to positive impulses among the companies of the medium-sized value index (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of executives are female.
In the previous year, however, the value was still at 3.8 percent.
The share of women in the 30 Dax companies - pioneers in recent years - has stagnated.
There were 26 women on the board of directors.
“I’m sure the Dax companies will be recruiting more consistent women again next year – in their own interest,” Ankersen said.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement signalled that they would not continue to commit themselves to increasing the share of "zero percent" so far.
A different picture emerges in the supervisory boards: as of September 1, the share of women there was 30.5 percent - 45 more women and 68 fewer men than a year ago.
“If the number of women recruited for the boards of directors were the same each year, a share of 40 per cent would have been reached by 2023,” the report said.
Some even make Miese: Luxury car bodies: Which manufacturer earns the most per car?

Who among the noble providers makes the most profit per car.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do the luxury manufacturers charge per car they sell?
This question was addressed by "Autopapst" and economics professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made an operating profit of 69,000 euros with each car sold in the first half of the year - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only comes to around 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley even put a lot on each car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race with prices on average of 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros profit before interest and taxes EBIT.

For the 60th time, the club organizes the wine festivals, which are now held every Saturday in October in the large festival tent on Rehweiler Straße.
At the start of the jubilee, the people in charge moved through the place to the festivities under the sounds of the Spielmannszug from Wiesenbronn.
Wolfgang Starz, Mayor Jürgen Schulz and Wine Princess Lisa Kursawe welcomed the guests in the already pampering festive tent. "60 years of this kind of arrangement - this is a crazy achievement for a small town with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of that," Starz thanked all the helpers.
Wine princess Lisa II later symbolically clashed with the guests from the stage.
"It's nice that so many people have found their way back to us after the wind blows." Later, "The Trogs" provided a mood.
On Sunday, when the Abtswinder Kirchweih was also celebrated, the club had fixed the drinks prices as it did 60 years ago on the occasion of the anniversary in the afternoon.
A feast evening for the 60th wine festival takes place on Friday, 5 October, at the guest’s house, before going into the second round a day later in the festive tent.
In Bonn: Emergency car force in Taxi
An ambulance is badly damaged next to a road.
A 27-year-old passenger was fatally injured in a collision with a taxi.
When emergency doctors are called, they are supposed to help - best of all, save lives.
Such a rescue trip in Bonn took a deadly end for a 26-year-old girl.
Bonn - A 26-year-old pedestrian was fatally injured in a collision between an ambulance and a taxi in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the ambulance doctor and their driver were seriously injured, the police said.
The 46-year-old driver of the ambulance had crossed a red traffic light on Saturday afternoon with blue light and Martinshorn.
He then ran into a crossroads with the taxi that was driving at Green.
After the collision, the doctor’s car was thrown against a traffic light pole and a tree.
He captured the passant who died at the scene of the accident.
Emergency car driver and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the ambulance were severely injured in their vehicles and had to be released from service.
The 29-year-old, who was also seriously injured, was able to free herself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another conscripted emergency doctor tried to do this - but without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
The police, in close coordination with the Bonn prosecutor's office, determine who is to blame for the accident.
Manchester United lose again, for Mourinho we are uncomfortable
After the blamable Aus in the League Cup, Manchester United now also lose in the 7th round of the Premier League.
West Ham United is subject to ManU 1:3. The way of defeat is still to be talked about.
The scene was symbolic in the 74th minute, in which rebounding Marko Arnautovic shot the 3-1 for West Ham; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford allegedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
As they suspected an offside at Mark Nobel's pass, all of Manchester's defenders stood still, leaving Arnautovic all the time in the world to pass the ball to the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative culmination of previously insufficient performance over long distances.
The situation with United’s rival Manchester City is very different.
The citizens trained by Mourinho's great competitor Pep Guardiola came to a 2-0 victory against Brighton & Hove Albion.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke through for the home team for the first time the defense bar of the outsider.
After a good hour and a double pass with the former goalkeeper, Sergio Agüero secured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer a leader
Three days after the 1–2 defeat in the League Cup, Xherdan Shaqiri won 1–1 against Chelsea with Liverpool in the Premier League.
As in the cup-out, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man among the Londoners.
The 27-year-old's hit in the 25th minute remained the game's only hit until the final stage.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, missed the draw after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge did better in the 89th minute with his slingshot.
After the Reds had started the week with a flawless record, Chelsea were not to be beaten for the second time.
At first, the Londoners eliminated Jürgen Klopp's team in the Cup, and by the draw in the league, the Blues Liverpool also fell from the top of the table.
Like City, the two London City clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) also celebrated 2–0 victories.
Fans of the Gunners, where Granit Xhaka played, had to endure a message of success against the surprise team from the county of Hertfordshire until the 81st minute.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart boxed Alex Iwobi into his own goal, only two minutes later Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil made the decision with his third goal of the season.
Arsenal moved past Watford for the fifth consecutive victory and is again just behind the great rival Tottenham in 5th place. A strong impression continues to be left by Ascension Wolverhampton under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained unbeaten in the league for the fifth time in a row at 2:0 against Southampton and finished 8th.
VW's core brand is missing: Paris Motor Show as a sign of diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years in alternation with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially not an issue and yet ubiquitous: The diesel scandal and the fight for driving bans and retrofits should not be let go of the German car companies even at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 Motor Show, they will be showcasing their innovations together with competitors from all over the world in the French capital from next week.
Diesel doesn’t really play a big role anymore.
The possible exchange and retrofitting offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are still to be negotiated with the government in Berlin until then, should nevertheless be an important topic at least behind the shiny backdrop of the exhibition stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: the Volkswagen Group is with Audi, Porsche and other subsidiaries, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are here and have their first pure electric models: the e-tron of the Ingolstädter is to come on the market at the end of the year, the EQC of the Stuttgarter 2019.
Both have been officially presented.
BMW's iNext will not be launched until 2021.
At the heart of Paris is the new 3rd.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors will be represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle manufacturers as well as numerous mobility services and software providers are present in each of their own halls.
The trade fair, which this year celebrates its 120th birthday, takes place in alternation with the IAA in Frankfurt every two years.
In 2016, a million visitors came.
At least 380 people were killed in the severe earthquake and tsunami that followed on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
In addition, there are more than 500 injured.
The island was hit by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had a magnitude of 5.9, the second a magnitude of 7.4.
Communication and transport connections are damaged, there has been enormous damage to property.
After the quakes, the tsunami broke in across the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds had gathered at the beach for a party.
It is feared that the number of victims will still rise significantly.
So far, the numbers have only come from Palu.
However, many other communities are also affected - along the west coast of Sulawesi.
About 150 bikers celebrate worship in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final service of God for the motorcyclists in the Peace Church in Eveking on Sunday with a team of helpers.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final service of God for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the spiritual care of PS-strong bicyclists.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) at the Haus Nordhelle takes place on the last Sunday of a month.
The end of the season is traditionally celebrated by bikers at the Peace Church in Eveking.
There, around 150 bikers gathered on Sunday to perform anything other than ordinary worship.
As early as 10 a.m., the Bolides were lined up in front of the entrance gate of the church.
At first, the biker-earthquakes were on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a thick curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
The sermon was given during the biker service by Pastor Dirk Grzegorek.
Singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided the musical underpainting.
"Although the bikers prefer blues-rock, Valerie Lill strikes more poetically calm tones," said pastor Frank Schröder.
This, too, was certainly a novelty in the history of motorcycle service.
Füchttorfer Heimatverein celebrates great festival: after the apple comes the milk
And at the actual day of action, Borisch was also active.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated to his astonishing spectators step by step the process from ripe apple to apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and let them fill the apples in the big funnel.
With a little muscle strength, the apples became a finely crushed mass.
Not many of the children could imagine how to make a tasty drink out of it.
But they were also able to look at this important step of the work this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in shapes and wrapped in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple pieces that looked a bit like chopsticks layer by layer on top of each other.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step of the work was no longer so difficult.
The freshly squeezed juice gradually ran into a large vessel.
But the Füchttorfer farmer also had ready-made specialties.
So he opened his "treasure box" and presented the older visitors with the latest feather whites.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was accordingly high.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents came to the conversation, while the children were not only able to follow the process of apple pressing, but also discovered the built bouncy castle for themselves.
Active members of the Füchtorfer comradeship of former soldiers also engaged in the festival and invited at some stations to play games.
In the coming year, the home club will also offer an action day.
Then, however, Gregor Krützkamp emphasized, the home in the heart of the asparagus village will not be the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also due to the topic on hand: After all, it will then go around the milk.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season-break: "Casual situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat in a row, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professionals from Hannover 96 around him and spoke to them with courage.
However, a lot of positives were not seen before in the 1:4 (0:2) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to get out of it as a team," said 96-football pro Pirmin Schwegler, pushing back: "This is of course disappointing, because you always take a lot of action."
The further undefeated Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) joined, stand with two counters at the bottom and are a candidate for relegation in their current constitution.
Led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt celebrated the first home win of the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzm<0xC3><0xA1>n (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) scored goals in front of 46,300 spectators for the DFB Cup winner, who finished in the European League game against Lazio Rome with seven points in the middle.
Croatia's vice-world champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive by the Hessians during his start-up debut and was never able to get control of Hanover's defences.
With his pace and perseverance, the attacker, who had been battered for a long time after the World Cup, showed why he was so valuable to unanimity.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan loaned from FC Liverpool was also the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurters, who began swinging.
For the first time, a header from Lucas Torr<0xC3><0xB3> (17th) falsified on the goal net.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96-defense around the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-term Kevin Wimmer (back).
The leadership for the landlords fell almost inevitably and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball to a defensive corner in the penalty area, Haller extended his head in front of the goal, where Ndicka only needed to hold her foot.
It was the first Bundesliga hit for the defender who came in the summer from the French second-tier AJ Auxerre.
And Frankfurt laid down even before the break.
This time Haller matched his storm partner Rebic, who skillfully tanked and 96-goalkeeper Michael Esser did not take a chance.
In the half-time Hannover-Coach Breitenreiter responded to the weak performance of his eleventh and brought in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt two new offensive forces.
The Lower Saxons were now playing a bit more courageous forward, but igniting ideas remained out until just before the end, when the follow-up hit was still achieved.
The Hessians were much more efficient.
After a short hour, Rebic started a solo and then placed across on De Guzm<0xC3><0xA1>n, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was just a spectacle for the Frankfurters against overworked guests, Jovic also met a minute before the end.
The Morlaix Square becomes a party mile
Würselen Despite the cool temperatures, there was a good mood at the Oktoberfest in the city center.
Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter made it to a million people at the opening of the 185.
Munich's Wies'n last week with two hits.
Geisingen: Geisinger Christians celebrate Holy Cross Feast
The Geising Catholics celebrate the Feast of the Holy Cross on September 14th or the following Sunday.
The festive service takes place in the city church, then there is a procession to the Church of the Holy Cross with the final blessing.
The Church of the Holy Cross is home to the shot Christ, who came from the Thirty Years' War and is believed to have been shot by a Swedish soldier.
Blood flowed from the gunshot wound.
From this, a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ developed, which then also led to the construction of the Church of the Holy Cross.
This is not finished to this day, only the altar room stands, the missing longhouse is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, pastor Adolf Buhl reminds us that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
The service was poorly attended despite its importance to the Geising parish.
After the service, the procession to the Church of the Holy Cross took place and with the final victory the ecclesiastical part of the Feast of the Cross ended.
For many years now, the Catholic Church Choir has been inviting you to the Catholic parish home for the secular part of the festival.
The choir members provided visitors with hearty food as well as a wide selection of cakes and adapted to the weather, farm ice cream.
In the afternoon, the parish offered guided tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed the visitors on behalf of the parish about the damage to the facade, roof, sandstone works and windows, as well as the upcoming construction measures, which will continue until next year.
After the scaffold has been standing for some time, the damages could be more accurately identified and the individual tenders could be prepared more concretely.
It is certain that the renovation is more expensive than planned, because the damage already existing a few years ago has become greater, but more has also been detected, which was only possible by the appearance of the eye using the scaffold.
The base plastering work is completed, before the winter the natural stone works are to be started and it is hoped that half of these works will still be completed this year.
Inauguration: New home in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens a new home for people with disabilities in the Münsterblickstraße.
That "a very special house" is now being handed over to its destination in the Münsterblickstraße - there all those present at the inauguration date agreed.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the Donau-Iller housing for some time now depend on the special architecture of the new building.
Broader corridors, corridors and doors, larger spaces and barrier-free access for all areas, architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account in his concept.
The first planning began about eight years ago, when the former U.S. Army officer building was put to the test for residents with a mobile phone cap: "The house had come into its years and no longer in modern equipment," Bader explained retrospectively.
In 2016, the excavators arrived to tear down the house.
The new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible, so that the residents can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens new home
About <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4.6 million was invested in the new building.
The Free State allocated 2.4 million euros, the district of Schwaben 450000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction work has remained within the planned framework - both in terms of time and money.
He was also thanked by Jürgen Heinz, the managing director of the life support service.
The gap between a barrier-free and at the same time fire-resistant construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many requirements that allowed the inhabitants to experience the freedom to move without the help of others.
Gertrud Kreutmayer, the head of the social administration of the Schwaben district, said: "The house is oriented to the special needs of its inhabitants, who need tools to be mobile".
Housing and functionality have been combined well, Kreutmayer said.
And further: "The property in this situation is a real case of luck, because in today's situation it can no longer be acquired in this way".
In total, the new residential building in the Münsterblickstraße offers space for 30 people with disabilities, which are divided into three residential groups.
Heinz is proud to be managing director of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed at tariffs.
Germany: Schwesig complains about differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the Day of Unity, SPD Deputy Chairman Manuela Schwesig appealed to all compatriots not to face the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unity.
We must not be satisfied with these differences," the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern told the "Day Mirror on Sunday".
The goal must remain to create a level playing field across the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans on average worked longer than the people in West Germany, but received 15 percent less wages.
“I can’t explain this to anyone almost 30 years after German unity,” said Schwesig.
North Korea: Does this poaching dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan-Jagdhund is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has gifted South Korean President Moon Jae In two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs.
As Moon’s office reported on Sunday, the two dogs, about a year old, reached their recipient on Thursday.
They passed the border town of Panmunjom along with three kilograms of dog food to facilitate the animals' "accustomation".
Dogs with thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They are part of the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The friendship was announced by the North at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in mid-September in Pyongyang.
The two countries also agreed to compete together in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to apply together for the 2032 Olympic Games.
In the course of the mutual rapprochement, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket propulsion.
Austria's moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months in this year of commemoration, numerous new books have been published, which answer this question mostly in the light of the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and general director of the Austrian State Archives, puts it quite differently in the magnificent "picture book" Austria, which will be published on October 1.
New week, new opportunity for the government
Back to the actual work - this is the unofficial motto for the Great Coalition working week starting today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the chancellor and her ministers from the CDU, SPD and also from the CSU recently did not chant the "return to business" mantra.
This may have led some artisans, doctors, cashiers and other employed citizens in this country to the legitimate question, what is the difference between work and non-work, but be that as it may.
If the federal government is now ready to dedicate itself again to its mandate - to the government - it should not be prevented from doing so with debates on terms.
Whether the Union and the SPD can actually do something together after the provocations and blaming of the last few weeks, will probably show already on Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the ruling parties meet in the Coalition Committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to regularly convene this round to defuse conflicts early; a lesson from all the controversy.
But first of all, with the diesel retrofittings and the specialist immigration law, conflict-prone issues are again on the agenda.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to make the car companies clear with exchange premiums, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the obligation to technically retrofit older diesels.
While the diesel crisis marked an approach over the weekend, the Union and the SPD are still far apart in the planned skilled labour immigration law.
The SPD is calling for a stay perspective for rejected asylum seekers who are working or training.
The Union is strictly against the "change of track" from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be a dispute between the coalition partners again - and how should it be different?
It is not EQUAL that has joined forces with GroKo, but three partners with in part very different societal views and priorities.
Dispute is good.
Without dispute, a society drawn from such diverse, sometimes conflicting interests does not advance.
But in order to be constructive, disputes must not be re-constructed for partisan reasons on the question of being or not being.
It’s still about politics, not theater.
The Union and the SPD should fight - but always keep an eye on the reality of people's lives.
What is feasible and benefits many?
With this guiding question, both the diesel and the track change question can be clarified pragmatically - and so confidence can be regained.
This is why the People’s Party must fight.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in the Visor
Does the Minister of Labour actually violate the applicable service law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"Actually day and night" had their co-workers worked on the social security reform, an exaggerated Social Minister reported at the presentation of the same two weeks ago.
Daniela Holzinger, the list-mushroom-mandatar, is surprised by Beate Hartinger-Klein’s (FP<0xC3><0x96>) statement – she is now bringing the matter to parliament via enquiry.
She assumes that "the Minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm for the use of her team and in no case announce violations of applicable service law in front of running cameras."
Nevertheless, she now has questions in order to be able to "free Har tings from any suspicion".
Police tear up a street in search of women's bodies
Marxgrün - For a long time the police did not want to comment on this.
Now there's a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning is dug on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben.
The track is closed in the area of Marxgrün until Monday.
It was presumed that the investigators had previously used an archaeology dog.
The dog specially trained for the smell of old human bones, together with its guide in multiple uses, was finally able to limit the relevant place to a few meters.
In addition, a soil anomaly has been discovered in the area of the said road, together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the top Bavarian monument protection authority.
For more than a year now, the prosecutor’s office and the criminal police court have been working on the missing person’s case.
Again and again, a cycle path was blocked at Marxgrün and examined with sonar devices, because the investigators suspect that Heike's body could have been clogged here in the course of the new construction of the state road 30 years ago.
Colour powder and eggs: Barcelona riots ahead of Catalonia's anniversary
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia will be held for the first time.
But before that, there will be clashes.
The separatists did not forget the police operation from autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum on October 1, 2017, clashes between separatists and the police took place in central Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by proponents of independence with powder of paint, among other things, as they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the national police and the civil guard.
Some 3,000 police officers from the Polic<0xC3><0xAD>a Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to honor their colleagues who were in the polls last year during the referendum, which was illegal.
Attempts to prevent citizens from voting had also come to violence at the time.
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and central government security forces separate, Spanish media reported.
Some of the 6,000 separatists then tried to break through the chain of police by force, and the officials threw paint bags and eggs, among other things.
Six people have been arrested, 24 others have been slightly injured, the authorities said.
On Monday, the independence referendum will be held for the first time.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to split the wealthy region of Spain, the central government in Madrid had placed Catalonia under forced administration in the fall of 2017.
The then regional president Carles Puigdemont fled into exile to Belgium.
Other politicians have also moved abroad.
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement, on the other hand, continue to be held in U-Haft.
New elections were held in the region in December.
After the inauguration of the new Catalan government in May, the forced administration was terminated.
But also the new regional president Quim Torra insists on the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Ratlessness: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen split
Red-white ahlen continues on the spot.
Even at FC Gütersloh it was only a 0:0 draw.
In front of 438 spectators in the Heidewaldstadion, the final light and the third last light turned out to be a total of inconvenience.
The first half was very manageable from the entertainment factor.
Anyone who wanted to get a beer or a fried sausage could do so without worry.
There was no risk of missing a torch chance, because there were practically none.
First shot after half an hour
For the first (harmless) goal shot of the entire game, Güterslohs drew Nick Flock in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle the only real - possibility had the Ahleners, when Cihan Yilmaz FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling forced to a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty area border.
The hosts were even more harmless.
Their most effective action was in an early change.
Stürmer Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, for him came Sinan Aygün.
After the change, both teams decided to do something against the growing boredom.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mützel aimed from 18 meters just above the housing and after an hour, the freighters also appeared offensively for the first time.
After a ball conquest by Matthäus Wieckowicz, it went well.
Nick Flock (62nd) "crowned" the fast-paced counters over Sinan Aygün with a sluggish shot into the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
They also played with a header from Wieckowicz (66th) after a corner ball from ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut reacted, first bringing Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60th) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70th).
It worked - nothing.
More than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative, the Ahleners did not achieve.
It wasn’t until the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had his last chance, but it also didn’t bring anything.
Angelo Daut then tried to highlight the positive: "I like that we played to zero", but unfortunately, the zero also stood at the front.
"This time we were not as dangerous as against Holzwickede and that although our opponent did not want to play here," said RW Ahlens interim coach.
Offensively, he "plaqued everything a little bit" against a team that "just wanted to defend.
At least I didn’t feel like we could get an opposing goal,” said Daut.
As a spectator, however, one did not feel that his team could score a goal.
The idea was too poor for that.
Reckenfelder Harvest Market: Fortunately, there are enough creamers
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Tafelausgabestelle, for which these donations are intended.
The volunteers assure: "These donations also remain in Reckenfeld".
At the opening, the sky turned out to be radiant blue, while the space was still somewhat empty, but that should change over the course of the day.
Because, "Here it's so nicely sociable, that's why we're here today," said one visitor.
Organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a decent touch of humor.
For the Brockmann couple, which should actually be weighed against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in for a short time.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are enough creams.
And the "replacement" did not allow itself to be entertained musically by the increasing number of visitors.
This was so good that a few folk songs were sung later in the hour.
"Just great," said Marcel Kreimer.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to include the opening date this time in his schedule.
He enjoys the many active people with their stands, mostly clubs.
"Actually, there should be no such thing as a board at all," he nevertheless thanked for the action of the men's choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the use of all who were in the stands and also included the other festivities held in September and the "Clean up" campaign.
Our garden city gives itself a colorful paint - here's what.
Then the Maikranz by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück was removed with the help of the fire brigade and brought to the winter quarter.
At many stands, work has been done for the physical well-being.
From sweet to hearty, everything was to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only been living in Reckenfeld for a year, became creative on his decoupage saw.
Furnishings, beer lids with reckenfelder motifs and much more he had on offer.
A specialty offered by three beekeepers: "Reckenfelder Honig", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Weershoven and Helen Roth-Buschlüter.
The latter has a specialty in it.
Honey cake in the glass, of course with honey from my own production.
There the little Elsa had to access again and again, so good tasted the cake.
It is the sociability that allowed the visitors to stay for a long time until the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Lubrications with local political message: No successful advertising for skateboarding
In Lengerich, strangers have hardly advertised in a favorable way for the construction of a skateboarding facility.
At several places there are corresponding lubrications, says Jürgen Kohne from the city administration at the request of the WN.
In at least one case, the police have been prosecuted for property damage.
In capital letters, the three words "Skatepark für Lengerich!" are stamped on signs at the Gempt Hall and the Old Town Hall, among others.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that already after the trade fair on 19 September a corresponding letter was discovered on the advertising sign at the staircase to the Gempt-Bistro.
Since the short message at the time was apparently "only" left with an edding, it could be easily removed.
"A few days later, however, it was there again, this time sprayed," says Rottmann.
It assumes that the corresponding advertising sign must be replaced.
A special note is given to this particular case by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the board.
If the skateboarding facility is built, its realization should also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already commitments, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the municipal department of school, sport and culture, without naming names.
However, it is possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the smeared board.
For years, local politics and administration have been dealing with the topic of skateboarding.
After the old one had been demolished at the LWL clinic, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
After all, the Council voted in favour of the fire department parking lot.
However, this notion was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against a construction on this site.
At the end of June, there was a turnaround.
The members of the Main and Finance Committee now voted unanimously for the area of the Gutenberg School.
Jürgen Kohne says about the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of the concrete planning.
The city council has the final say.
It is based on a decision this year, so that a positive vote in 2019 could be built.
Narrowness in flight security becomes even worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and then comes the storm," said Matthias Maas, head of the Air Safety Union, at the German press agency ahead of the aviation summit in Hamburg on 5 October.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight failures is the long-known personnel shortage in European air traffic control, for which there is no quick solution.
“The airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new lotteries takes four to five years,” the unionist said.
Across Europe, the market for ready-trained lottos has been emptied.
In the centre of Karlsruhe alone, about a hundred people were missing to monitor the upper German airspace.
Maas again criticized that various air transport unions were not invited to the summit.
In the Hanseatic city on Friday, representatives of the federal government, countries, aviation security, airlines and airports will meet to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work compression and overtime, this will not go without us," said the head of the GdF, which has many members at the German Federal Aviation Safety Agency.
Maas once again made the EU Commission’s specifications responsible for the Lotsen-Misere.
Traffic forecasts for the regulatory period up to 2019 were far too low.
The resulting cost specifications and personnel savings in the national flight insurance systems are now fully transferred to the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to advocate in Brussels for regulations that “don’t shut the air further off” from air security.
Currently, the EU targets are to be agreed by 2024 and further tightening is to be feared.
The EU has been subject to constant lobbying by airlines.
“Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown in recent years,” Maas said.
He hoped that the high cost of delays in the airlines would trigger a rethink.
The GdF will only contribute to improving the situation if the German Aviation Safety Authority (DFS) offers a "coherent training and future pact", Maas said.
The so far announced annual admission of 120 pupils over the next five years is just enough to compensate for the age-related departures.
The necessary staffing is not yet connected with this.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board Votes for Group Reconstruction
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously in favour of the plans to restructure the Group.
According to the will of Thyssenkrupp Interim Director Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed Chairman of the Board at the meeting on Sunday, the group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies will be based in Essen and listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional staffing cuts beyond the already known cuts in the administration.
After two resignations, the control body on the capital side counts only eight heads.
There are ten representatives of the employees.
However, the final decision is expected to be taken by a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG will include, among other things, the 50 percent stake in the merged steel business with Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business will be bundled with lifts and deliveries.
Barcelona: Violence at demos by police officers and Catalan independence advocates.
Two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police and Catalan independence advocates in Barcelona have resulted in violent clashes with numerous injured.
According to the city administration, about 3,000 policemen from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as about 6,000 pro-independence protesters.
The Catalan police have tried with a large order to keep the two protest moves away from each other.
However, according to the task force, proponents of independence repeatedly tried to break the security barrier.
They would have attacked the officers with paint and shotguns.
According to the information, there were also riots between the participants of the various protests.
According to rescuers, 24 people were injured.
Police said there have been six arrests.
Better Salaries and Appreciation of Colleagues
The police wanted to pay tribute to their colleagues, who almost exactly a year ago opposed the independence referendum in Catalonia, which was banned by the Spanish central government.
At the same time, they demanded better wages.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel it is unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn significantly more than they do.
The demonstrators felt it was a provocation that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked the 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez of the AFP news agency.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they drowned us a year ago.
A 31-year-old Balearic policeman, who only wanted to give his name to Daniel, rejected the accusation.
“Of course, we want to support our comrades who last year only did their duty: defend the law,” he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona because this is a big European city and there is more echo here.
He and his colleagues, however, “did not come to provoke,” the police officer said.
Panne allowed access to personal data of British ministers
A security breach in a mobile app has caused the personal data of ministers and MPs from the Conservative Tory Party to be temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from strangers after the breakdown was announced a day before the Tory party meeting in Birmingham.
Two people trapped on B217
On Sunday morning, the Hannover Police reported a serious traffic accident on Bundesstraße 217, Hamelner Chaussee, at the exit of Wettbergen in the direction of Ronnenberg.
Two people were killed when they drove their car against a tree.
The car is currently in flames.

Football: Juve coach praises top game: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese star striker "played the best game this evening along with the half hour of Valencia," praised Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri after the record champion's 3-1 (1:1) victory against the SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensively bought star was the decisive man in the important game against the persecutor even without his own goal.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and he's doing well," Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from that moment on we have grown.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goals, Juve shot the game after the early setback through the hit of Dries Mertens (10th minute) and hanged the worst pursuer for the time being.
The goalkeeper picked up by Real Madrid first put on the former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who provided the lead with a double pack (26./49.).
And Ronaldo also performed the preliminary work to the goal of header Leonardo Bonucci (76.), who just before the goal line had to push in.
"There are a lot of templates," the coach praised.
However, Allegri also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the record goalkeeper in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
“We have to get even better at serving him,” the coach asked.
Best Juve goalkeeper is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, Juventus’ superiority seems to be even more overwhelming.
Seven victories in seven games is the immaculate series in Serie A. At 21 points, the champion of the past seven years has already six counters ahead of Naples.
The second-place finish against Turin, which was coached by former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti, was not without chance.
But no later than after the place reference of the already warned Mario Rui (58th), the top part was decided.
The Portuguese had to get off the pitch after a tough start against Paulo Dybala with yellow-red.
"We played well against a good Naples," commented the Turin coach.
Emre Can could also be heard.
The German national player has prevailed at Juve.
The professional came from FC Liverpool was in use in all seven league matches.
The midfielder also played in the Champions League match against Valencia, Allegri said with the "half hour": Ronaldo had flown off the pitch in the 2-0 victory of the Turiners and is blocked for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes his name
With a particularly bizarre appearance, rapper Kanye West has garnered attention at the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" this weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume caused head snorts and question marks among the spectators.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a name change in time for the release of his new album.
It can only be called “yes” by the musician.
"The creature that used to be known as Kanye West," he tweeted in response to the late singer Prince as he dropped his stage name.
The pseudonym is not news.
The 10th album was released under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist had stated that "Ye" had a religious meaning for him.
"I believe 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means 'you'," says the rapper.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
Done!
Hoetmar's coach Averhage made no difference in his disappointment.
It was a weak game for us today.
The opponent was simply more gripping, we have almost never faced him with any problems." Accordingly, the list of Hoetmarer shooting opportunities is thin.
Grade two shots in 90 minutes, so that games can rarely be positively shaped.
Football-Kreisliga A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two options in the first pass, but the first used Maik Krause from a sharp angle to lead early (7th).
In the 43rd minute, Steffen Uphus could have increased, but after great pre-work by Krause, he spread free standing.
The hosts only had a double chance when at first Moritz Höne failed at Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher and Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49th), Julian Turl (61nd) and Heinz Linnemann (69th) all forgave.
A trading meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved his hand on the goal line and looked red for it - Niklas Eilmann could also not use for the guests (75.).
It was not until Nils Berheide knocked the ball over the line that the match was decided (81.).
“We had criticised ourselves before, which was different today than in the last few weeks,” said Kraus.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77th Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90th Leibig), Turl.
Goals: 0:1 Krause (7.), 0:2 Berheide (81.).

Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectacular football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
“I don’t know what to think of it,” he said.
"We didn't get any access to them," he supposedly meant the wing tongs with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also all the other green-whites who came out with collective offensive urge.
He could still laugh: "A dirty victory," he said, blinking frantically and pulling from then His players on the other hand was the relief to note that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Well-recognized, after a duel of two teams, one of which, namely Albachten, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for class preservation.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes that lay behind him.
"This was by far our best season performance," he says.
"How we come back after the 0:2, how we keep against one of the top teams in the league all the time, that was really phenomenal."
The more bitter it seems that you now have to drive home with empty hands.
Top goalkeeper Lars Zymner led the hosts with his 12th goal of the season (24th).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
He set the 2-0 for Fabian Fröhning (39th) on the left side.
We knew that, but you can’t take a player like that out completely.
"It was already madness what he did," Lewandowski recognized the quality of the opponent jealously.
Shortly before the change of sides, his own eleven managed to compensate: McGill's free kick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe through to the long Toreck (45th).
After the change of sides it was again McGill who scored the equaliser (59th).
Then it went back and forth.
It was a crisp, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64th), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann died (69th).
Albersloh was no longer able to counter the last Concordia hit (80th).
We must now focus our full attention on Wednesday.
"The game against sheepdogs, that's what we have to win now," Lewandowski said.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87th Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87th Bareksai).
Goals: 1:0 Zymner (24th), 2:0 Fröhning (39th), 2:1 McGill (45th), 2:2 McGill (59th), 3:2 Nübel (64th), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69th), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80th).
Yellow-Red: Atalan (74th/Albight).
Football: TSV Strassberg wins point against Primus
There were no winners in the Landesliga duel between TSV Straßberg and FV Biberach.
The leader of the table had actually travelled for three points, but the team of coach Oliver Pfaff was very good and in the end the game ended 0: 0.
Media: Resignation of the entire Presidium of Dynamo Dresden
According to media reports, the entire bureau of football league player Dynamo Dresden has resigned.
Several media outlets in the evening agreed on a joint letter from the Board of Saxony.
Initially, there was no confirmation from the club.
The reason for the withdrawal should be internal power struggles with the former Bundesliga player.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of Pompeo
I'm glad he's gone again.
There are few state guests whose departure in Germany provides as much relief as those of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
For three days the Turkish president was a guest in Berlin and Cologne, and many had thought that he should not have been invited at all.
Evangelische Akademie Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy Tutzing offers about 80 meetings by the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has signalled that he wants to personally collect the Tolerance Prize in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: as Federal President, he was not in Tutzing’s Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was a guest there.
This is what Academy Director Udo Hahn realized when he proudly said: "All the Bundespräsidenten and Bundeskanzlers were already with us." The fact that celebrities appear at the Academy at Tutzing Castle again and again, but was also an issue in the presentation of the annual program.
At the end of October, songwriter Konstantin Wecker attends a conference on spiritual experience from a philosophical perspective, on September 29th the writer Frido Mann attends a conference about his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has also pledged to accept the "Tolerance Prize" awarded to him by the Academy personally in Tutzing, which TV host Dunja Hayali also receives in another category (we reported).
The approximately 80 meetings until mid-2019 have it in them.
"Retirement is not safe!" reads a conference title.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - this is how the Academy describes the "riskful and deadly route across the Mediterranean".
"And to a meeting on Syria: "Barbarism without Limit".
Weapons deals, destruction, torture, death - the war mocks any humane idea".
From structural racism in society to the scissors between the poor and the rich to the radical change of work through digitization, the spectrum extends.
“A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to look for solutions, or at least partial solutions,” Hahn said.
At a 200th meeting.
Karl Marx’s birthday is soon to be expected by the more visitors to the direction of capitalism-criticism, the others rather a tendency “from the outside to the center”.
What does neutrality look like?
“We are 100% a daughter of the Evangelical Church,” said study leader Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, “so we are not 100% neutral.”
Music Cabaret: Gender Understanding with Heart - Wolbeck - Westphalian News
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christ Church in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret artist, Teubner embraced gender understanding, not only with humor and warmth for the (feeled) woman and (feeled) man and whatever else there may be, but also with music.
The mini guitar used her and also mastered her violin.
Ben Süverkrup was sitting on the wing.
He is, on the one hand, the male sparring partner, who sometimes comes to the end of the sentence, on the other, a true pianist: So congenially harmoniously accompanied by Süverkrupp Teubner that some may have wished for a solo.
This was the case, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, namely, as it suited the Red Thread of the Evening.
There Teubner had brought into play a paradox: the satisfaction of the man comes if he has a partner, but does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner is of no use.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same: What would have emerged from Mozart’s composing if “the Nannerl” had opened the door unexpectedly?
Thus, Süverkrupp slides over in improvisations, from Bach's "O Kopf voll Blut und Wunden" into the "Song vom Tod", and from Mozart's g minor symphony into a playful little dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Flowers were presented by Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, the chansonette.
However, Chairman Heidemarie Markenbeck was not allowed to take an additional thank you.
She had the idea to give the duo a performance in Stuttgart and Frankfurt, as well as one in Wolbeck.

Bruchsal.
After a bus accident on the A5 in Baden-Württemberg, the police slightly corrected the numbers of victims.
Ten rather than 15 passengers were injured.
All have since been discharged from the hospital.
The French bus driver had stayed in the hospital for one night for observation.
He will be fired during the day, a police spokesman said.
The cause of the bus accident at Bruchsal is still unclear.
The long-distance bus was pushed unbraked frontally against a dashboard on Saturday morning.
Handball: Damen-Landesliga: Ahlener SG keeps the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlen women had problems especially with the third-league player Carolin Stallmann, who scored ten hits alone.
"Actually, I was happy with the defense, only one player has scored too many goals.
We didn’t get them,” said ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu.
However, he was more upset about the many missed opportunities.
The focus in the end left his team missing this time.
The ASG therefore ran almost to the end of a setback, lay behind for the break with 11:12 and later with 15:18 (45th).
It was only towards the end that the broader bank of the hostesses became decisively noticeable.
In addition, Aydogdu placed Merle Klement on the left, which then made "extremely clever the decisive goals" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd League Women: Top performance of the BSV Ostbevern in the top game at VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyball players of the BSV Ostbevern have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd Liga West.
At the second-league descent VC Allbau Essen, the blue-whites won with 3:1.
"It was a huge step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz to play in the top third of the league.
That’s what we’ve worked out now,” coach Dominik Münch looked forward to his team’s almost impeccable performance at the knocked-out leader.
The first pass was dominated by the guests almost at will.
Over 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went with 25:15 to the vice-champion of the previous year.
Food was accepted in two bars, but did not get into the game.
We've got them busy.
Our opponent has hit with high risk, but also produced several tickets.
In the second sentence, the BSV led already with 12:8. "Essen has switched the assumption to three-bar.
We couldn't keep up with the pressure.
Food has gone downhill, and we’ve had a bit of a nap,” Munch continues.
At 18:17, for the first time the volleyball players from the Ruhr area had their noses in front.
Although Ostbevern defended four more set balls at 19:24, the fifth attempt found its goal.
"The game was now a class better," the exercise manager found to the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly to the BSV turning the page in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
Munch: "We played there consistently and calmly."
Over 7:3 and 15:13, the blue-white pass four brought 25:22 to their side.
Vera Horstmann was chosen as the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier had also caught an excellent day.
BSV-Frauen: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea und Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish Community: Mosque Opening as a Missing Opportunity
The Turkish Community in Germany (TGD) has criticized the way in which Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan inaugurated the large Ditib mosque in Cologne.
"The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left a shard in the German-Turkish relationship, which can only be arduously reconciled," said Gökay Sofuoglu, chairman of the TGD, the editorial network Germany.
Both the Turkish and German sides would have missed the opportunity for a common, reconcilable appearance.
"Instead of emphasizing the affiliation of Muslims with Germany alongside German top politicians, Erdogan has used the date for his purposes," Sofuoglu complained.
The widespread exclusion of the German public has “enhanced many reservations”.
Home club Nottuln: offer has already been established
After the long summer break, it’s finally time for folk reunions.
On October 18 (Thursday) at 7.30 pm, the Heimatverein Nottuln is already organizing its fifth Nottuln folk meeting in the fireplace room of the Old Office.
Almost exactly a year ago, we held a folk reunion for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln," says Hanns Moormann, Chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I didn't think that our folk meeting was going so fast in Nottuln eta.
Whether Sturmtief Friederike in January or Heatwave in July, the chimney room of the Amtmannei was always full.
"The program at the next folk meeting is, as always, a colorful mix of German folk, hiking and sailor songs, folk songs, evergreens and old drummers," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who repeatedly invites friends to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer has promised his accordion for the first folk rendezvous "birthday".
For many years he was a member of "Gaitling", a group from the neighbouring district of Steinfurt that played music with German lyrics.
Now he's on the road with an Irish folk band.
The makers of the folk reunion are happy to remember the last event in the summer when Christoph Schulz of the folk reunion Emsdetten with his international version of the song "Frogs in the Night" delighted the listeners and sent them home with an ear worm.
"We count on many happy guests to once again spend a sociable and humorous evening," the club's invitation reads.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to actively participate is invited to join.
Since the desired seats are always quickly occupied, it is advisable to be there early enough.
The folk meeting starts at 7.30 p.m., but admission is already at 7 p.m.
China approves planned merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all open questions must be clarified by October 24th.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking another step forward on their way to becoming the world’s largest industrial gas group.
The Chinese competition authority has approved the planned merger, Linde announced on Sunday.
As a result, the billion-dollar merger still faces approvals in South Korea and - as the biggest hurdle - in the United States.
Recently, according to an insider, the chances of approval had improved there because Linde promised to sell additional company parts.
For legal reasons, all open questions must be clarified by October 24 for the merger to succeed.
From pure fruit production to ecology
With a gala in the Dr. Stamberger Hall, the 125th anniversary of the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege was celebrated.
On September 29, 1893, with a fruit show in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, the last impulses were set for the Kulmbacher Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a great anniversary in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle on Saturday evening.
Of course, at that time he was called even different: as "Bezirksobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land" he was lifted from baptism by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit growing association was also different from today's work - it was in fact purely about fruit growing, about flowers and horticulture nobody thought about at the time.
"At that time, in the era of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," said district caretaker Günter Dippold in his festive lecture.
Fruit trees should line long-distance roads, so-called industrial gardens were built at schools.
To this day, fruit production is still the responsibility of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7,000 members.
However, the spectrum is far from exhausted.
A natural horticulture, biological plant protection, village embellishment and nutrition play an equally important role as the conveyance of knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorfer Jugendgruppe "Maulwürfe" entertainingly showed on stage how versatile the tasks of a horticultural association are.
“Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age,” said Günter Reif, chairman of the district, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed the importance of experiences in nature for life.
Collecting chestnuts was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that you can collect a lot of joy with Smartphone & Co..
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where they should stand, the Kreisverband decides," added Landrat Söllner, highlighting the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district left no doubt about it, even the district manager and specialist consultant Friedhelm Haun.
He led the many visitors with a picture lecture through the long history of the Circle Association and reported, among other things, on the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past, everything came out of the garden, for the winter it was stuffed.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the utility garden turned into a decorative and residential garden.
"Nature is in existence, it was already there before us and we have to orient ourselves to it," the expert pleaded for fruit and walnut trees.
Therefore, there is an incentive for the horticultural associations not to give up, so that our home remains beautiful and worth living.
This includes welcoming the new citizens to our clubs,” added Wolfram Vaitl, president of the Bavarian National Association.
"We have to stop the dramatic decline in insects, which is what we owe to our children and grandchildren," concluded Günter Reif at the successful festival, which was solemnly framed by the tower winds of the Thurnau music club.

Priority on Nafta talks: Canada’s Foreign Minister postpones UN speech
Mexico’s government wants clarity on Nafta: They are providing the two trading partners with an ultimatum to an agreement.
Canada's Foreign Minister now gives absolute priority to the trade agreement - and postpones her speech to the United Nations.
Due to the time pressure in the fight for a new edition of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the United States and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of speaking on Saturday, the minister will not speak until Monday in front of the United Nations General Assembly, her spokesman Adam Austen said.
In the meantime, they are focusing on the renegotiation of Nafta.
Mexico’s economic minister, Ildefonso Guajardo, said on Friday that Canadian and U.S. negotiators would have 48 hours to agree if Canada actually wanted to accede to the trade agreement already reached between his country and the U.S.
The U.S. and Mexico agreed on a recast of the Nafta regional free trade agreement in August.
U.S. President Donald Trump suggested that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
Talks about a new edition have been going on for over a year.
By Sunday evening (local time) they should now be brought to a conclusion, the Trump administration wants to present the agreement before October 1st to the US Senate.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico's President-elect Andres Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against Presidential candidate Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, injured in a knife attack, has left the hospital.
The far-right ex-military wanted to fly to Rio de Janeiro, where he lives, according to a report in the daily O Globo.
After his dismissal, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will make public appearances in the week before the presidential election in the South American country.
The politician was attacked in early September during an election campaign event in southern Brazil on the open road.
Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in several Brazilian cities to protest against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele n<0xC3><0xA3>o" (in German: "Der nicht"), especially women's associations had called for protests against the ex-military.
Also on social networks, the anti-Bolsonaro associations made racist and women-disgusting statements mobile.
In the economic metropolis of S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo, several thousand demonstrators were expected.
In the capital Brasilia, the protests were mixed with a rally by the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers’ Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He replaced former President In<0xC3><0xA1>cio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and was therefore not allowed to run.
The presidential election in Brazil is on October 7.
As the former mayor of the millionth city of S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo, Haddad was far behind the far-right candidate Bolsonaro in polls so far.
The "Trump of Brazil" has been involved in politics for a long time, but recently presents itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates in the first round of elections achieves an absolute majority, there will be a general election on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge from this successfully - no matter who he is competing against.
Bolsonaro is known for his anti-gay and anti-black hatred and glorification of the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Again and again he is shocked by verbal outbursts.
Another time, he said, the supporters of Lula’s left-wing workers’ party should be shot.
Europe wins Ryder Cup title
Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines - Just an hour away from Disneyland, European golfers have written another Ryder Cup fairy tale outside the gates of Paris.
Captain Thomas Björn’s team of outsiders dethroned the favorite U.S. title defender for a toothless Tiger Woods in front of more than 150,000 spectators on the three days at Le Golf National with great punches and outstanding team spirit.
After a long illness: Danish rock legend dies
Danish rock icon Kim Larsen has died.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen reported on Larsen’s website.
On his deathbed, Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician had been in treatment since the beginning of the year for prostate cancer.
Larsen had become famous with the band Gasolin', which was hugely successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Her songs were influenced by international music greats such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the band's breakup in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold about three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album "Midt om natten" is still the best-selling album in Denmark.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen on Sunday praised Larsen in a statement as a "street boy" who was "against everything, but in all hearts".
The head of government also recalled that the monarchy opponent Larsen appeared in 2010 on the 70th birthday of the Danish Queen Margrethe II.
Rock night in the shoe factory: volume at press air hammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saw and ignite a concert evening with the power of a tiger." Only the band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" put such a rewrite of the rock live music experience on Saturday night in the hall of the city center band and close to three shoe factory: Harddro
After the sound check and just before the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There is no sign of lamp fever.
Afterwards, the rock stars from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in association with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands, the around 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night are clearly visible.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows to convince to the start of the concert evening also with the latest, unknown pieces from his own pen and the soon to be released CD.
In front of the stage, the band dances to the harmonious and intense interaction of the performance.
Although "add" calls cannot be ignored, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leaves the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
The fact that hard rock is not the same as hard rock is demonstrated by guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with their alternative sounds, sometimes reminiscent of classic rock from the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers", "Here We Stand" also uses a synthesizer in addition to guitar rock.
It’s not just the longing, almost ballad-like “Take Me Home” that captivates with the change from melodic passages to the guitar-loaded rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
However, the quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishausen has gained a special degree of fame since its founding in 2005.
Full of agility, the band will present their hard rock on Saturday.
That "The Ignition" with its performances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the tour in China of 2017 - has special stage experience is obvious and inaudible.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann, in collaboration with the band, also sets his own accents in the only cover song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
For the sound that feels even higher than before, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers an acclaimed solo, running through the audience.
A certain volume belongs to such a hard rock concert, of course: At the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, according to the information of the mixing team, the three-piece concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is about 98 decibels.
This is, for example, at the compressed air hammer level, but it is still clearly below the controls of the "Wacken-Fesitval", which "The Ignition" points out on their website.
A deafening 120 decibels in nozzle drive volume, as is usual with the annual metal station in the north of the Republic, however, the Ahlen audience does not need this rock night.
After just under four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocky Gangart have long since convinced themselves with their sovereign, virtuoso play and their own compositions.
"Here we are, we have taken the bone saw and lit a concert evening with the power of a tiger," all three groups can say, of course in the transmitted sense, in the end.
And above all enjoy the big applause of the visitors.

One killed in a plane crash at Essen/Mülheim Airport
A fatal accident occurred at Mülheim/Essen Airport.
On a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen Airport, a sailplane crashed on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
A fatal accident occurred near Mülheim/Essen Airport on Sunday.
As the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" reports, a sailplane crashed in the exhibition parking lot at the airport.
The pilot was killed in this.
As the "WAZ" further reports, the student was alone on board - the plane is said to be a single-seater.
The plane was already in the landing area at the time of the accident.
The crash site is located just a short distance from a festive tent on the airport grounds.
There has been an Oktoberfest since this weekend.
The airport Mülheim/Essen is located on the city border of the two Ruhr area cities and directly at the motorway 52.
From the parking lot there is a Park&Ride offer at major events at the Messe Essen or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump: "And then we fell in love"
The fact that North Korea’s President Kim is well-intentioned despite the nuclear crisis is no secret.
But now Trump has made a real declaration of love to his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters".
At the tender age of 72, the married U.S. president has announced a new flame.
The Tragic: It’s a long-distance relationship.
In all publicity, Donald Trump on Saturday made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
In front of supporters in the U.S. state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half-old branch of the ruling Pyongyang dynasty, even though that proves to be quite tough in the fight for North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
“I was hard-hearted, he was, and it went back and forth between us,” Trump said.
And then we fell in love.
-Okay?
No, really.
And it wasn’t just the conversations with Kim that would have melted his heart.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection has also borne political fruit: Trump referred to Kim’s announced halt to all nuclear and missile tests, even though critics see little more than lip confessions.
That the affection for the “Rocket Man”—Trump’s nickname for Kim—not everyone should have—seems to be quite conscious to the US president.
In any case, he took the expected criticism in advance when he appeared in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they fell in love".
How horrible, how horrible is that?
This is so unpresidential.
But he cared very little, Trump explained, and then pointed his finger at the crowd: “I’ve always told you it’s so easy to be presidential.”
But then there wouldn't be 10,000 people pushing into this crowded arena out there, but we would only have 200 people standing out there.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler is best visited, moody and also full of sun: very varied and with a good shot of Oktoberfestflair, Baesweiler's downtown has cleaned up on Sunday.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest took place not only in the festive tent at the fire tower, but was extended to the city by the trade association on Sunday.
Refugees rescued from Libyan prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees have pointed out their disastrous conditions of detention in Libya using a mobile phone video, enabling them to be rescued.
The group had shot the footage in their cell in the coastal town of Savia in July under threat of death and spread it online.
“They refuse to send us back,” a man said in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the website "France 24 Observers", whose editors alarmed the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were eventually flown to Nigeria at the end of August.
“Without the video, we probably wouldn’t have been able to return to Nigeria,” Efe Onyeka, who recorded the video, told AFP.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya while trying to cross the Mediterranean to Europe.
With the video, he put himself in danger of life, according to his own statement.
One of his accomplices was beaten almost to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general, the conditions of detention were catastrophic: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM is organising the voluntary return of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria were sent back to their homeland this year with the help of the program, said IOM spokesman in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the now rescued Nigerians is not unusual in view of the poor conditions of detention in Libya.
He hadn’t heard of a cell phone video call.
International organisations have long criticized the situation in the Libyan refugee camps as unworthy of human dignity.
The North African state, which is dominated by too many militias, is the main transit country for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the elementary school on Sunday afternoon to prepare her classes for Monday, she surprised a burglar.
At around 16:50, the teacher entered the building via the main entrance.
In the front yard of the first floor, she saw a man fleeing immediately.
First through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there via a ladder to the ground floor or the forecourt.
The teacher informed the police, who took up the investigation.
Whether things or money have been stolen is not yet known.

German man was trapped in his own car for days
A 75-year-old has had to endure several days and nights in his car in a forested area in central Franconia after driving the car off all forest roads and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescuers accidentally discovered the car on Saturday afternoon near a pasture and freed the missing since Tuesday night, police said on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was reportedly in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He said he was now looking forward to his home.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after he had not returned from a ride with his SUV through the local meadows and fields on Tuesday.
Despite intense search efforts, the man’s whereabouts remained unclear for days.
Laschet urges rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) has called for the rule of law in Turkey in talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Relations between the two countries are currently "overshadowed," Laschet said Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport.
This is especially true of arrests, freedom of the press and freedom of religion.
He has therefore made clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalize in the future, if economic relations are to deepen, that the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this.
Laschet also spoke about the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey.
He expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan has once again stressed the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan was briefly moved to a building of the Federal Ministry of Defense’s air readiness at Cologne Airport.
Originally it was supposed to take place on Castle Wahn - but the owners of the castle had rejected this out of political conviction against Erdogan.
Erdogan continued to travel after the conversation to the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had canceled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said, "The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their contact - and not the Turkish president.
Lack of confidence in the US: North Korea demands disarmament
While U.S. President Trump will not get tired of highlighting the successes in negotiations on North Korea’s denuclearization, the East Asian regime is presenting the conditions more sober.
Secretary of State Ri calls for Washington's settlement.
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has accused the U.S. government of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula with its ongoing sanctions.
“The most recent standstill comes because the United States is building on coercive measures that are deadly to confidence building,” Ri said in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea under these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will be the first to disarm ourselves," he said.
That sanctions could force North Korea to “knee” is “a space of desire for people who don’t know us.”
To build trust, however, his country stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri said.
However, from the U.S. side, there have been no “corresponding reactions” to this, the minister criticized.
Because of North Korea’s nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council had decided on sanctions against the internationally isolated country three times last year alone.
U.S. President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have urged strict compliance with the sanctions at the United Nations in recent days.
At the same time, the US government is working on a rapprochement.
In June, Trump met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for the first time.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US president aspires to a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is scheduled to travel to Pyongyang again to talk about ending North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the community
The fact that they were actually in a youth meeting, the many visitors of the open door house HoT got nothing from it: white blankets and floral ornaments on the tables and a large buffet were waiting for the guests after the Thanksgiving service.
The young people of the HoT were enchanted by the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The establishment was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank the food.
The launch of the new facility was not easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, remembers.
We had filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were perfectly prepared for the big day.
But then on the first day after the summer break came the nasty surprise: a power outage had put the huge, two-part refrigerator out of operation, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start from scratch: we got a lot of support from friends and neighbors, but the children and teenagers wanted to do it alone," Westbuer said.
And that's how they all dealt with it.
The result could be seen, the guests were enthusiastic.
“Cooks can’t do better either,” one visitor praised impressed, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to serve quiche, liver cheese, or cake.
"It's really great what the children and teenagers have put on their feet," emphasized pastor Frank Beckmann, while wizard Stephan Lammen was amazed with card tricks and other pieces of art.
Jürgen Sator leaves the board of directors of NRW
Frustrated about criticism from his own ranks, the head of the Essener Tafel, Jörg Sartor, has resigned his position in the Landesverband.
Sartor had become known nationwide because the Essener Tafel had introduced a reception stop for foreigners.
He resigned as deputy head of the NRW boards in July, Sartor told the "World on Sunday".
Too many fell on my back.
Wolfgang Weilerswist, head of the Tafeln-Landesverband NRW, expressed his understanding of the decision of his long-standing deputy to the dpa.
Sartor took the sharp criticism with him.
"I can understand his step - there have been people who did not know exactly why the Essener Tafel does this".
Sartor, however, is still active for the Essener Tafel - "six days a week, nothing changes about it," says Weilerswist.
In the "World on Sunday", Sartor again criticized colleagues from other boards.
One should not follow the approach, "without us, the people in the city are starving".
It is the responsibility of the state to ensure that people do not go hungry.
The Essener did not take part in a panel congress in Berlin on Friday.
"I'm told too much sweet taste," he said.
There are all these social fuzzies who criticized me that way at the time.
SF Lorch play 2-0 lead - Gmünder Tagespost
Football, Bezirksliga Lorch loses to Neuler 2:3 - TV Heuchlingen wins in Kirchheim after backlog - Bettringen beats Lauchheim clearly.
With 2:0, Lorch was already in the lead in the home game against TV Neuler - in the end it was 2:3 and the disappointment with the sports friends was great.
Quite different from the TV hypocrites: In Kirchheim, the TVH quickly fell behind with 0:1, but won after 90 minutes with 2:1.
Gladbach plays two-time lead - Schalke without embolo with first win
Borussia Mönchengladbach has to wait further for a away victory in Wolfsburg.
At 2:2 the foals play a lead twice.
Schalke comes to Mainz for the first win of the season (1:0).
(sda) Schalke has maneuvered away four times in the first five league games with early opponents.
Now the team of Domenico Tedesco once again put the strength to the day with which it had taken the first place behind the Bavarians in the last season.
Alessandro Schöpf led the home team in the eleventh minute after strong preliminary work by Yevgeni Konopljanka per head, in which case the hosts preserved the mini pad with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an exceptional comeback, Borussia Dortmund is again greeted by the top of the Bundesliga.
The team of Lucien Favre had negotiated a 0:2 draw against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but came to a 4:2 victory in the second half.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65th) and Marco Reus (69th) equalised with a doublet within four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63rd minute, ensured with another doublet in the final phase (86th/94th) the crowning conclusion of the performance increase after the break.
The VfB Stuttgart also won the first match.
Against the decimated Werder Bremen already before the break due to a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic, the Stuttgarters had to fear in the meantime.
Borna Sosa and the inattentive Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler manufactured a curious throw-in proprietor that helped the guests to compensate in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not have a completely successful, but also not a failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbacher, who joined the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang, gave a two-time lead, ultimately played 2:2 and have been waiting for an away victory in the VW city since 2003.
Renato Steffen was in charge of Wolfsburg's 1-1 draw with his second Bundesligator.
Yann Sommer was powerless in the 20-metre flat shot from the Aargauer, as was the second counter-stroke in an hour.
Nevertheless, the trends at Gladbach are quite promising.
Alassane Pléa turns out to be a goalie in the storm of foals.
Against Wolfsburg, the French record purchase from OGC Nice hit for the third time in a row and for the seventh time in the seventh compulsory game.
After seven rounds, Gladbach finished 4th.
Within 40 minutes, the previously undefeated Werder Bremen maneuvered against VfB Stuttgart in an uncomfortable position.
After 19 minutes, the team of Florian Kohlfeldt was surprised by a Stuttgart counter, which the ex-Luganese Anastasios Donis concluded with his first hit of the season, after 36 minutes Milos Veljkovic continued to his team: the 23-year-old Serb cashed after a jersey sacrifice against Daniel Didavi Yellow-Red.
Although Stuttgart defender Borna Sosa and Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Bremers back into the game by a curious throw-in goalkeeper (68), a quarter of an hour before the end Gonzalo Castro shot the Stuttgarters acting in excess back on the Siegesstrasse.
Nuremberg decided the duel against Düsseldorf 3-0 sovereign for themselves.
After half an hour Hanno Behrens brought the home team on course using Foulpenalty.
Macedonians vote on new state names
In Macedonia, around 1.8 million citizens are voting on whether to change the name of their country in North Macedonia.
If yes, the nearly three-decade-old conflict with neighbouring Greece could be resolved.
Athens had insisted on a name change because of its northern province of the same name, blocking any approximation of Macedonia to the west.
Voters therefore also decide on the future of Western integration.
The United States had announced that the country could quickly become a NATO member with a positive outcome of the referendum.
Syrians in U-Haft.
The man attacked three women.
A Syrian man brutally beat three pensioners, injuring them in part.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker ransacked the refugee camp in Alsergrund around 10 p.m. on Friday.
When the police arrived, they spoke to the accused, who ran with his fist against passers-by and tried to attack them, about his behavior.
Then the Syrians tried to beat and kick the officials.
Shortly thereafter, it turned out that the suspect had beaten three older ladies (65, 67, 75) with his fists to the ground at a tram stop in Währinger Straße shortly before.
He also kicked the trio with his feet.
Some of the pensioners were seriously injured.
They suffer from hematomas, bruises and concussions.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured "for an unknown cause", as the police said.
He was taken to the hospital and monitored continuously during treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
The two of them gave themselves the yes word in Hamburg on Saturday.
A registered life partnership was not in question for them, Kahrs had previously told the "Image" newspaper.
"If we get married, then right." He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a spokesman for the SPD-Bundestag faction and one of the speakers of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs had aroused outrage on June 30, 2017.
He had accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of being "stupid" about the issue.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said in reference to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the field of adoption law.
Garden day: 400 meters hedge cut
There was a lot of work in front of the members of the citizens' association Kinderhaus and the society for leprosy dogs.
For about 400 meters hedge around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfründnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the residents, it went to work for about twelve supporters.
“We are doing this to reduce costs,” said Walter Schröer, chairman of the Citizens’ Association.
And it has accumulated so much.
Due to the hot summer, we are late this time, but fortunately it is now just a shape cut.
Because already in the spring the hedges were shaved once.
The breakfast that always follows to work also has a long tradition.
“They should all stay in power,” said Walter Schröer.
World Championships in Rio: Hannes Aigner gets gold at the Kanuslalom World Cup
The Augsburg Hannes Aigner has won the gold medal at the conclusion of the Kanuslalom World Championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old put on a perfect run on the Olympic track on Sunday.
Two years ago, he had missed Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well-prepared, had enough rides here at the facility and everything has worked out today," said the London 2012 Olympia third.
In the goal, he threw his paddle away from joy and stretched both arms to the height of victory - knowing that it would be enough for at least one medal.
After all, he had starting number four.
But the remaining six starters could not top its fabulous time of 89.69 seconds.
Second was the Czech Jiri Prskavec before the Russian Pavel Eigel.
The police inspectorate Gauting reports the first attempt to break into a single-family house this fall.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - that's what burglars want to take advantage of again.
The police inspectorate Gauting reported yesterday the first attempt at burglary this autumn.
The fact that it remained at the single-family house on the Königswieser Straße is due to the alarm system.
It started when the perpetrators laid hands on Friday just before 8 p.m.
The burglars knew that the residents were not at home.
However, the alarm system apparently surprised them in such a way that they escaped without prey.

Bankruptcy at Hertha: Recovered from reality: Bayern challenged against Ajax
The predicament is unbeatable: the defeat in Berlin wants FC Bayern "not to be liked".
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first intermediate conclusion for the term of office of Niko Kovac.
The first small performance segment under the new coach Niko Kovac is not meant to increase for the Munichers to the greater autumn low.
“One week ago we had the impression that we were invincible.
Now a little bit of reality has caught up with us," stated Thomas Müller after the deserved 0:2 defeat at Hertha BSC and demanded a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us knows that this is really annoying and that is why we are giving gas towards Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year, no goal of their own was scored abroad, as at the same time of the pre-season two mandatory games in series without a win, the table leadership in the Bundesliga football for the time being lost to Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation is not as dramatic as at the end of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record champion must be warned.
FC Augsburg at the 1:1 with its run-intensity man-against-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful needle stitches over the outside have delivered two equal blue breaks within three days, as the last superpower Bayern seem to crack.
“Those who know FC Bayern know that we don’t like it and we will do everything to make it successful again,” Kovac said.
Otherwise, however, he moved with his losers in his hometown surprisingly gently and pushed his first defeat as Munich coach only to the once again deficient handling of chances.
A victory against Amsterdam and Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would still make the first interim result of his term positive before the national game break - otherwise the tone is likely to tighten.
Kovac also did not take any extraordinary measures before the second royal appearance this season after the 2-0 draw at Benfica Lisbon.
After the free day on Sunday, as planned, the short preparation for the second pre-round match against Ajax, who had also defeated AEK Athens sovereignly by 3:0 at the start, begins.
"Now it has caught us in two games, but we will also make our goals again," announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.
As after the lost Cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua Kimmich spoke clearly.
The defender acted in the role as a defender.
"I don't think it's all bad luck, we have to work it out again because we don't make the variety of chances and make the mistakes behind it," the 23-year-old said just before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, the Bavarians were already behind Dortmund with five goals, which has now taken the lead again with one point.
And so Kimmich, with a wink of the eye, at least positively assessed that the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has now come to an end.
“Yes, that’s a good thing,” said the national player.
It’s good for the league.
DFB boss in line of fire: <0xC3><0x96>zil-Causa: Sharp attack by Erdogan on Grindel
With heavy accusations, Turkish President Erdogan denounces the exclusion of Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the union line.
A new post is to be created.
Berlin - On various stages, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the interpretation of the Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil issue.
After the Turkish president fiercely criticized the treatment of the former world champion in Germany for the opening of the large Ditib mosque in Cologne, the DFB head defended the association line.
Early on Sunday morning, the Grindel, personally attacked by <0xC3><0x96>zil, announced consequences from the cause at the ZDF "Sportstudio" in Mainz.
"In the future, because we also have many players with a migration background in the U-teams, we have to draw very precise conclusions that this is not repeated," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migration background as another integration commissioner.
At the same time, Grindel reiterated that Erdogan does not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
He had sharply denounced racism against <0xC3><0x96>zil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our German-born and raised Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil and our Ilkay.
They have expelled them from this society because they allowed themselves to be photographed with me in England," Erdogan said Saturday in the cathedral city.
To be honest, as their president, I couldn’t digest the fact that our two young men, who have risen to the German national team, were excluded.
Grindel referred to Gündogan’s statement that, unlike <0xC3><0x96>zil, he felt “reasonably treated by the DFB” after the World Cup affair, which began with photos of the two with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he would want to face players in the future.
That someone says: If I win, I’m German, if I lose, I’m a migrant – that’s not possible.
“I am very sorry that he has such an impression,” Grindel said.
We should have defended Mesut more, I've always said.
However, he does not see a basis for <0xC3><0x96>zil’s return to the national team.
As a result, in addition to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon, an additional integration commissioner will be appointed.
"If someone without a migration background has a clear impact on society and football and says, 'This is an important issue, we have to take care of it,' that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground where integration needs to work," Grindel said.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the <0xC3><0x96>zil affair, he wants to run again for the office of DFB President next year.
“I’m doing my job and trying to do it as well as I can,” Grindel said.
Annual builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - As reported by police, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.
Initially, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red traffic light in the area of Lauterer Höhe.
She informed the pensioner that he was driving against her car.
However, a personal exchange did not take place, as the 75-year-old could not find the lady in the parking lot anymore.
A short time later, the police received a telephone message about a driver who had left the road and was driving towards a pole.
The man did not want the police on the spot and then drove away.
After that, the red-talker drove home.
However, the pensioner has been in his place of residence where he has been living for decades and has framed a construction vehicle when turning.
Finally, the police were able to find him and stop him.
His car was clearly damaged in an accident.
The 75-year-old made a confused impression and could not remember much.
The damage is about 1300 euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: still almost 1000 operational forces in operation.
About four weeks after the outbreak of the Moorbrand on a federal military site in the Emsland, 980 troops are still engaged in the extinguishing work.
This was announced by the Federal Armed Forces on Sunday.
As the situation continues to develop steadily, according to a spokesman, 70 volunteer helpers were recently withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of troops is planned, it is said.
On the night of Sunday, an above-ground fire had been discovered and extinguished.
Last week, the disaster, which had been declared well a week earlier on September 21, had been lifted because of fears that the flames would endanger adjacent forests and settlements by wind and sparks.
On Thursday, it was then said that the fire would no longer threaten to overtake neighboring communities.
At times, more than 1,500 local forces tried to get the Great Fire under control.
The Luftwaffe further supports the work on the Bundeswehrtestgelände near Meppen with a transport helicopter.
In addition, there are reconnaissance flights with drones of the Bundeswehr.
According to the Bundeswehr, reconnaissance flights with "Tornadoes" are also scheduled for 2 and 5 October.
The fire was triggered by test rockets fired by Airbus technicians.
The smoke flag of the Moorbrand had been temporarily pulled up to a hundred kilometers far over the northwest of Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr wants to set up a contact point that receives damage reports.
Initial claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, the politician married his longtime friend in Hamburg.
The two have been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost exactly one year after the marriage for all came into force, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
The two of them gave themselves the yes word in Hamburg on Saturday.
A registered life partnership was not in question for them, Kahrs had previously told the "Image" newspaper.
When we get married, right.
He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a spokesman for the SPD-Bundestag faction and one of the speakers of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs had aroused outrage on June 30, 2017.
He had accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of being "stupid" about the issue.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said in reference to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the field of adoption law.
Referendum in Macedonia on new state names started
In Macedonia, the long-awaited referendum has begun on a new name for this small Balkan state.
About 1.8 million voters are expected to decide whether their state will be called North Macedonia in the future.
Because of its eponymous northern province, it is the neighboring country of Greece.
As a means of printing, Athens had blocked every rapprochement between Skopje and the EU and NATO for almost three decades.
If the citizens vote yes, they also give the start of the Western integration of their country.
Elie Wiesel - The Author Who Saves the Shoah from Forgetting
Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would have been 90 years old on September 30.
The 1986 Nobel Peace Prize laureate dies in the United States in 2016, leaving behind a work that preserves the horrors of the Shoah for posterity.
Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donations and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not change anything about the fact that organs can continue to be removed only with explicit consent, emphasizes Swisstransplant.
(dpa) Switzerland is launching an electronic register for organ donors on Monday.
This is intended to facilitate organ donations and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
People who wish to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes are then available in case of need from Swisstransplant.
The new procedure does not change anything about the fact that organs can continue to be removed - as in Germany - only with explicit consent, emphasizes Swisstransplant.
It is estimated that 15 percent of Swiss people have a donor ID card, says Franz Immer, director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of cases, a card will be found at the crucial moment with possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of conversations, relatives do not know the deceased’s wish.
"They then have to make a decision in the sense of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," he said.
A similar registration system already exists in the UK.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information about possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokeswoman of the Federal Center for Health Education, Marita Völker-Albert, says.
“A register in which people can register their desires – pro or contra organ donation – does not exist,” she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has spoken out for a new regulation of organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would initially be considered an organ donor, unless he or her family members object.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is world champion in head counting
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is the world champion in head counting.
At the weekend in Wolfsburg, he faced 39 opponents.
This was announced by Martina Flamme-Jasper of the Science Museum Phaeno, the venue of the competition, on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grüss from Germany took third place.
The youngest World Cup participant was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 74-year-old pensioner from France, as Chief Arbitrator Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were for example: 14.130 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
Since spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, where participants competed against guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenzel Greetings from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air while counting.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Greetings were already two years ago as a then 14-year-old in Bielefeld.
With terms such as superbrain, genius, or miracle child, organizers can start Laue little.
"Head counting can be trained," he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even stadium-oriented computer competitions.
The disciplines include, for example, drawing square roots from six-digit numbers.
When calculating versatility, candidates are given surprise tasks, for which they must quickly find a solution strategy.
The Germans also had good chances here, the chief arbitrator said.
Otherwise, Asians are often in the advantage, because there, in early childhood, head counting is learned more intensively and with other, effective methods.
Intrusive Appeal: Video with Nude Serena Williams: It's About Breast Cancer Early Detection
Serena Williams’ tennis ace shows off her emotional and sensitive side.
The 37-year-old wants to point out breast cancer with this video and make herself strong for early detection.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings at the top without the song "I Touch Myself" from the group "The Divinyls" - only her hands cover her most intimate spots.
Singer Chrissy Amphlett has died.
The emotional video is part of the “I Touch Myself” project, which is about early detection of breast cancer that can save lives.
Serena Williams would have died almost a year ago.
At the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia there were complications.
An emergency operation was initiated to save the baby’s life.
In a subsequent CT scan, blood clots in Serena's lungs were then detected.
Just in time...
The government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The German government is planning a significant expansion of the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the turquoise-blue coalition will send a corresponding bill to the so-called "symbol law" for review.
This will significantly increase the number of terrorist or similar groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings new snow to the mountains in the west
Ms. Holle is shaking her beds out in the west next week for the first time: Polare cold air reaches Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to meteorologists at the Central Institute of Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit at the beginning of the week drops to 1,500 to 1,200 meters - in narrow valleys, it could snow down to about 1,000 meters at high intensity, it was said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern, 20 to 40 centimetres of new snow can be expected above 2,000 metres.
On higher pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions become wintery.
Farmers are allowed to start their annual squat care on Monday
Farmers in Schleswig-Holstein are allowed to start their annual crocheting on Monday.
The unique "green swells" in Germany have shaped the landscape of the forested state for about 200 years.
The trees and shrub hedges up to five meters wide are "forest set" and for many animals and plants the last retreat rooms.
Knicks connect as corridors scattered habitats over which the exchange of organisms can still function, as the managing director of the Nature Conservation Federation of Germany (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwigowski, said.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were created on the orders of the Danish King Christian VI in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field boundaries and cattle fences, they also supplied the farmers with firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
From that time his name also comes "Knick": By "knicking" the branches were able to develop the dense, intertwined boundaries.
Today, between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, about 45,000 kilometers of hedges extend and give the image of a woody, diversely structured landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used by around 7000 animal species as a replacement habitat.
Up to 1,800 different species could live in a kilometre of knick and breed up to 30 pairs of birds.
However, its ecologically important function can only be fulfilled if it is properly cared for in the winter.
Otherwise, it turns into a light row of trees that, in addition to biodiversity, also degrades the wind protection effect, said Ludwichowski.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, knick care can only be carried out outside the breeding season from October to March.
After tsunami in Sulawesi Indonesian talks about local situation
The local Radika Pinto describes in an interview with the Redaktionsnetz Deutschland (RND) the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and tsunami:
Were you there during the tsunami?
No, I was just in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes were over, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I heard about the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
There I arrived on Sunday morning, because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, as the airport on Palu was closed at the time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that auxiliary goods can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all of which were completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" has also been destroyed, but we have provisionally set up something where we have also accommodated other people.
Where are the people living in Sulawesi now?
Many have run to surrounding hills, where they still endure for fear of another tsunami and earthquakes and where they have no access to water and food.
Some are standing in front of their houses, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and also the gas stations are completely closed, people partly steal food and gasoline.
The public service is completely shut down, the national government is helping out.
A prison has also been destroyed, the prisoners are partly running free and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How is the communication and information supply on the island?
At the moment we have cell phone reception, but before that did not work and we only received information via radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people who they do not know if they live and where they are staying because people were not at home during the earthquakes but, for example, on the road at work.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have information about this?
We don’t know the reasons for this, but when the alert came, many people thought, “Okay, no tsunami” – and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was misinformation that a tsunami hits the region and they ran into the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi, located on the Pacific Ring of Fire, not prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how to respond to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.
Injuries to Werder: VfB must give up on Aogo and Donis for a long time
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will be absent from VfB Stuttgart with severe muscle injuries for a long time.
Aogo drew a muscle fiber tear in his left thigh at 2:1 against Werder Bremen on Saturday, the football Bundesliga player announced on Sunday.
In Donis, the doctors diagnosed a muscle bundle rupture in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably still miss games even after the next country game break.
The VfB Stuttgart did not give a forecast at the time of downtime.
A muscle bundle tear usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fiber tear usually heals a little faster.
Triumph of Hyperrealism at the San Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n Film Festival
San Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n - The San Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n Film Festival annually closes the ranks of the most prestigious European festivals.
Despite all the hymns to the cinema can be summed up: 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.

On Sunday morning, the fire brigade Olching tried to capture an injured duck.
However, the action dragged on for some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - A white, injured duck appeared on Sunday morning to walkers on Lake Olching.
She stayed in the area of the water guard station.
To help the animal, the passers-by called the police and the fire department.
However, the first attempts to capture the duck went wrong.
Despite the injury, she was able to evade the forces again and again.
In the end, she fled to the lake.
With a lifeboat, the firefighter was able to encircle the animal and push it back ashore, where it was then put into a transport coffin after almost an hour by a firefighter with a hearty handle.
The duck injured on the chest was then taken to the animal clinic of the LMU to Oberschleißheim.
But according to the initial estimates, their chances of survival are rather low.
Biathlete Julian Eberhard wins World Cup medal
Fourth place at Olympia was Biathlete Julian Eberhard long in the stomach.
In the coming winter, Saalfeldener wants to recover the lost precious metal at the World Cup in <0xC3><0x96>stersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in the Olympic sprint of Pyeongchang the medal close to grab.
Seven tenths of a second was missing in the end on bronze.
"I have consciously given myself time to process this," says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym fitness studio in his hometown of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top shape, but it just didn’t want to be.
All the more motivated is the Pinzgauer to pick up the missing precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to come back to a great event with the constitution, to win something.
At some point, you have to hit it too.
The World Cup track in <0xC3><0x96>stersund (SWE) is Eberhard: "I have already closed the track in my heart", he recalls with joy his fourth World Cup place in the singles race last year.
Immediately after the Olympics, he celebrated the only single victory for Austria in the Kontiolahti (FIN) mass start competition last World Cup winter.
With the season he ran in Oslo (NOR) to second place.
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation at turbo tempo
The time is extremely short and the number of planned interrogations is very limited.
With an FBI investigation at the turbo tempo, Republicans in the U.S. Senate want to secure the thin majority for the controversial judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
President Donald Trump has set investigators a deadline until Friday to clarify the alleged incidents more than 30 years ago.
The most recent turn in the drama around Kavanaugh’s vocation, accompanied by a cultural struggle, was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing between Kavanaugh and first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, in the course of which the lawyer threw out angry tyranny against the opposition Democrats, the Senate Judiciary Committee should clear the way for the final confirmation of the orc conservative judge in the U.S. Supreme Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed assured when Senator Jeff Flake suddenly declared against his original announcement that he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had described Thursday's serious pretensions as a "shooting," initially refrained from further attacks on women, speaking on the contrary of "happiness in misfortune."
In this way, the last doubts could be eliminated, he said.
Later, at an election rally, Trump attacked Democrats sharply because they rejected Kavanaugh: “They’re trying to block and destroy.”
Trump orders FBI investigation into Kavanaugh case
The White House has also severely restricted the powers of investigators.
You will be specifically investigating the known allegations of two women, no more, a government official told the Wall Street Journal: "They are not going on a fishing trip."
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
According to the municipality, the mobile radar device, installed in a "civil vehicle" of the municipality of Ried for monitoring the speed limit, is stationed at the garden road from Monday, October 1.
There is also the Federal School Centre.
The municipality also operates several fixedly installed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: The fear was felt
Coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first win of the season against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first win of the season.
However, the time factor also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist in football games.
This was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
“I saw every ball in it.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penalty area," said the sports director of Schalke 04 - and breathed in.
After all, the Royal Blues still managed to bring the barely 1-0 against the Rhinehessians over time and thus the first victory of the season under the roof and compartment.
In fact, it could have been different.
After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf 11 to the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco had given Tedesco certainty: "In sum, the first half was good, both playful and from pressing"., with increasing duration of play, obviously more and more the head played a role.
He doesn’t actually create a baseball monster.
“The last ten minutes have felt like two hours to me,” said Heidel, “if the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that.”
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands, so they kept retreating.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three counts of the season.
"We all have a huge stone from the heart," said Schöpf, who did not have an insignificant share with his headball hit: "I'm actually the worst headball player in the men's team".
In the end, only victory counts.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
“We wanted to start with a lot of pressure in the initial phase and make a firework out of it,” said Schalke’s head coach.
Victory was important.
Finally we can look forward to a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We played intelligently, calmly and bravely, so we have to tackle games over 90 minutes
Probably the biggest shortcoming of the afternoon: Royal Blue missed it, rather than worrying about clearer conditions.
The possibilities were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who hit the latte twice 59./72. or Amine Harit 62.
“Then it wouldn’t have been a tremor victory,” Tedesco said, “you’ve already felt the fear a little bit.”
So I'm glad we won.
He wasn’t the only Schalker.
Fischbachau: Smoke column in the Leitzachtal 2 km visible
The smoke was not to be overlooked.
From about two kilometers away, a hiker in the Leitzachtal Valley observed a fire on Sunday around 13.30 pm.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau - Police and fire brigade soon found out the cause: An unknown man had set fire to a two-square-metre area on the Gschwendner Berg rubbish.
According to police, it appeared that he had been monitoring the fire for a long time, but then left the glow unattended.
And that near the forest.
30 Fischbachauer firefighters were busy pulling and extinguishing.
The police are now investigating for arson.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at eye level
In front of them is the author, Professor Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has repeatedly followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have made it my task for many years to bring interesting people to Greven," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treffen" - that association that cooperates with the alliance "Cultural Policy" in the organization of the evening.
El-Mafaalani gets very loosely into the reading, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject intelligibly.
With a lot of gestures, hand-held figures and one or another joke, he brings one of the most conflicting topics to the audience: migration and integration.
Why are conflicts growing despite successful integration?
The Syrian author uses himself to answer the question of a metaphor.
The German society sits at a table, while the first generation of migrants sits at the cat table.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to sit at the table.
The third generation of migrants is born in Germany, they have always been at the big table and now want to be part of the decision-making process.
This leads to conflicts.
The decisive factor is therefore not whether one is politically right-wing or left-wing, but: “Am I for or against an open society?”, he emphasizes.
At first rather behave, then more and more exciting the discussion round is going on.
And there is a need for speech.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani is, not on stage, a symbol of the discussion: it is at eye level.
The sociology professor does not push his opinion, stressing that he speaks of the average, not of individual destinies.
He is pleased that there is interest in the issue, because "only if we understand what the problem is, can we find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
Even during the following signing hour, he still had an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialties, was intensively further discussed.
Basketball: Bonn and Gießen win kick-off games
The Giessen 46ers and Telekom Baskets Bonn have finished the first day of the Bundesliga (BBL) with a home and away win.
Gießen won a hard-fought match in his own hall with 91:84 (43:46) against the central German BC.
The ambitious Bonners won at BG Göttingen with 86:79 (49:47).
The first leader of the season is Alba Berlin after the 112:55 Gala on Saturday against Science City Jena.
At the beginning of the new season, the German champion Bayern Munich and the former series champion Brose Bamberg had significantly more effort.
Munich already struggled on Friday to an 83:77 at ratiopharm Ulm, Bamberg won the Frankenderby at s.Oliver Würzburg on Saturday with 84:80.
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The demand is obviously huge: over 100 interested parties have applied for the purchase of one of the plots in Landsham-South.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first land in the new Landsham-Süd area on the free market.
This was announced by Mayor Roland Frick.
In addition, the application phase for those 20 plots is completed, which the municipality offers at more favorable conditions or prices - similar to the previous local model.
More than 100 applications have been received, according to Frick.
"Currently, the documents are being reviewed" with regard to the application criteria, completeness and correctness.
According to the mayor of Pliening, the aim is to have created the candidate ranking list for the 20 plots by the end of the year and to present it to the municipal council.
After that, the award can be made.
A total of 50 plots of land for single and semi-detached houses will be created on the site in the south of Landsham, as well as four plots for multi-family houses with eight residential units each.
The development is now almost complete, the roads and paths are expected to be paved soon.
A single plot and two of the multi-family houses belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality of Pliening.
It sells the bulk on the free market, 20 plots in the socially compatible model.
According to Frick, the two multi-family houses in the municipality are to be built as affordable housing.
With a total of 16 income-oriented apartments funded by the Free State.
Space for 200 people
Roughly estimated, on the area of the new construction area Landsham-South housing is created for about 200 people.
Not only that: now, at the beginning of October, according to Frick, the start of the new construction of a kindergarten is taking place there.
There will be three kindergartens and three nursery groups as well as a multipurpose room.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, the start of the next kindergarten year.
This is how Schalkes Naldo succeeds in "great sport" also on the bench
For the third time in a row, not in the starting eleven: Naldo still thanks Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had sat for the third time in a row not in the Schalker Startelf, but on the exchange bench, the understanding among many people would have been great if the almost two-metre-tall Brazilian had really talked about the frustration of the soul.
But when the Schalker players, after the 1-0 victory over FSV Mainz 05 as usual, gathered in the middle circle and thanked head coach Domenico Tedesco with all his professionals, the 36-year-old, who everyone calls Naldo for simplicity, joined in and said, "We have to thank you, coach!"
"It was very emotional, it was a great sport," Tedesco later said of the reaction of his vice-captain, who, despite his new reservist appearance, had no resentment.
Probably, Naldo, who was celebrated last season as the best Schalker, knows that he actually didn’t get on the pitch with his coach – but for good reason gets a break.
A reason called "load control".
It was not easy to tell him.
“It wasn’t easy to tell him that, I’ll tell you the truth,” Tedesco told Naldo when he said he wasn’t in the starting line-up.
He is an important player, he is an important person.
But it’s always about the thing, it’s about the club,” Tedesco said.
Naldo played 90 minutes against Bayern and Porto.
He's 36 years old.
It is important that at the moment everyone can sneak through.
And that we all keep in the boat,” explained Tedesco to the Rotation, which recently also caught Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by also proving himself to be an exemplary team player on the bench.
The mood in Austria’s industry continued to accelerate its downhill journey in August compared to the eurozone.
The Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) was at a 37-month low with 46.7 points.
Europe-wide, Austria still has the third-best mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute announced on Monday for its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the PMI of the euro area increased by 1.1 to 45.1 points, the index is still the 13th consecutive month under the mark of 50 counters, which indicates growth.
Only Ireland’s industry broke this threshold by 50.9 points in August.
The final highlight was the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer fell, although slower than in the previous months.
In Spain, the index reached its highest level since March with 44.0 points.
“The slightly weakened descent could mean that the worst has survived,” said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
However, the industry remains – at least in the third quarter – the number one growth brake.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the eurozone have fallen as sharply as they have since November 2011.
The companies therefore completed the seventh month in a row.
Also in China, industrial production fell more sharply than initially assumed in August.
The mood barometer dropped from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts initially expected 47.8 points.
The Purchasing Managers Index is based on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Among other things, developments in sales, employment, stocks and prices are collected.
Tuchel's PSG team succeeds after victory in the eighth league game
29 September 2018 at 19:45
Nice coach Thomas Tuchel races from victory to victory with Paris Saint-Germain in the French football championship.
At the OGC Nice, the defending champion won thanks to two hits from Superstar Neymar with 3:0 (1:0) and was thus also successful in the eighth league game.
The last time Olympique Lyon played in France was 82 years ago.
The Brazilian Neymar led PSG after 22 minutes and finished in the playoffs.
Christopher Nkunku (46th) made it 2-0.
With this, Paris also managed the general rehearsal for the groundbreaking second Champions League group game against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
At the start of the Royals, Tuchel's team had to accept the only mandatory game defeat so far this season at 2:3 in Liverpool.
