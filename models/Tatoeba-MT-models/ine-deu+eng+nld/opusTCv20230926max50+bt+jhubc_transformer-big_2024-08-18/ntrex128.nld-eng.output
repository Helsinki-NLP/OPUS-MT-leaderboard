Members of the National Assembly of Wales worried that they “will be compared to Muppets”
There is shock among the Members of the National Assembly of Wales by a proposal that their title would be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament - Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal is a result of plans to change the current name ‘Welsh Assembly’ to ‘Welsh Parliament’.
Members of the National Assembly of various political parties are concerned that the new name is ridiculously happening.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Labour Party said that MWP “rides Twp and Pwp”.
For readers outside of Wales: twp is Welsh for crazy and pwp is Welsh for poop.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Plaid Party said that the group as a whole is “dissatisfied” and has proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his party is “open” to the name change, but notes that the words MWP and Muppet are very similar.
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced as a short u.
The Committee of the National Assembly of Wales, which is currently drafting legislation to carry out the name change, said: “Of course it is the members of the National Assembly of Wales themselves who make the final decision on their new title.”
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave members of the National Assembly of Wales the right to change the name of the Assembly.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed that most people felt that the National Assembly should be renamed Parliament.
As for the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission proposed ‘Welsh Parliament Members’ or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most support in the public consultation.
At the moment, members of the National Assembly would propose alternatives, but President Elin Jones will have a hard time reaching a consensus. She will have to submit a bill on the changes in a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms also includes other changes to the way the National Assembly works, including rules on the suspension of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the system of committees.
Members of the National Assembly will definitely be able to vote on their new title when they debate the legislation.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the name of their country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether they want to change their country’s name to ‘Republic of North Macedonia’.
The popular referendum was organized in an attempt to resolve an entrenched dispute with neighboring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour means that the country would claim its territory and has repeatedly objected to requests from Macedonia to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is against the referendum on the name change, has said he will not take into account the outcome of the referendum.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The clocks of Saint Martin's silence, those of Harlem have difficulty
“The older people I spoke to said there used to be a cafe and a church on every corner here,” Adams said.
Today there is neither a café nor a church to be seen here.”
He said it's understandable that cafes have disappeared.
“People now have social contact in a different way,” he said.
“Cafés are no longer the living room of the neighborhood, where people regularly walk by.”
However, he is concerned that the proceeds from the sale of the church’s assets will be shorter than the leaders expect, “and sooner or later they will be back at the beginning.”
Churches, he adds, could be replaced by apartment buildings with flats where the kind of people who would live would not help in the remaining refuges of the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who will buy flats in such buildings will be white,” he says, “which will lead to these churches being closed even faster, because it is unlikely that the people who move to these flats will become members of the church community.”
Both churches were once built by a white church community, before Harlem became a black metropolis: the metropolitan community in 1870, Saint Martin's 10 years later.
The original church of white Methodists left in the 1930s.
A black church from the neighborhood took over the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black church community led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the shopkeepers on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, where blacks could rarely get a job or be promoted.
In 1939, the building was severely damaged by fire, but when the parishioners of Reverend Johnson made plans to rebuild the church, they also bought a beard.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Reverend Johnson and his successor in Saint Martin's, proudly called the beaver "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the instrument in July referred in another way to the instrument: ‘a cultural treasure’ and ‘an irreplaceable historical instrument’.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first bell in the world ever played by a black musician, namely Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger bell of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said Saint Martin's hadn't replaced him.
The events of recent months in Saint Martin's are a complicated story of architects and contractors, some hired by the church's lay leaders, others by the diocese.
The Consistory (the governing body of the parish, consisting of lay leaders) wrote to the diocese in July to express its concern that the diocese would "calculate the costs" to the Consistory, although the Consistory had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors who had sent the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old Man Who Dived To Crab In California
On Saturday, on the first day of the crab season, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy who drowned in crabs in California. The boy suffered injuries, it is said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday when he heard the boy screaming for help and, along with some others, paddled to the boy to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that he first thought the boy was screaming because he had caught a crayfish, but then he realized ‘that the boy was shouting, ‘I’ve been bitten!
I've been bitten!"
His keybone was completely open," Hammel saw as he approached the boy.
“I screamed that everyone had to get out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is reportedly in danger of death.
It is not known which shark species is responsible for the attack.
Beach guard Captain Larry Giles told a news conference that a shark had been spotted nearby a few weeks earlier, but that it had been concluded by then that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim was seriously injured in the upper body.
The authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for the purpose of research and safety.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's wants to break into the British beauty market
Sainsbury’s competes with Boots, Superdrug, and Debenhams, setting up beauty departments where specialized assistants work, such as in department stores.
The initiative is part of a strategy to conquer the British beauty market, which is worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continues to grow, while sales of fashion and household goods continue to decline. The larger beauty departments are being tested in 11 stores across the country. If they prove successful, they will be launched in even more stores next year.
The investment in the beauty market is also a consequence of the fact that supermarkets want to fill the shelves where TVs, microwaves and interior items once stood with other products.
Sainsbury’s wants to double its beauty offering and offer 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space, with exhibition space per brand, such as in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also bringing its Boutique make-up back to market, now that most products are suitable for vegans, something younger shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, perfumery the Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two stores of Sainsbury's. The first one was opened in Croydon, south London, the second one will open later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
As more and more people shop online and more and more often buy small amounts of food in local supermarkets on a daily basis, supermarkets need to make more effort to convince people to shop at them.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury’s chief executive, says the stores will increasingly look like department stores, as the supermarket chain takes on discounters Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos points of sale into hundreds of stores and has also opened a number of Habitats since both chains were acquired two years ago. According to the company, this has increased food sales and has resulted in higher returns on acquisitions.
The last time the supermarket tried to give its Beauty and Pharmacy departments a make-over, that became a flop.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership was terminated when a conflict arose over the distribution of revenues from the pharmacy department in supermarkets.
This is a new strategy since Sainsbury's sold its 281 pharmacy departments in stores three years ago for an amount of <0xC2><0xA3>125 million to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
Lloyds would also play a role in the plan, adding an extensive range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve completely changed the layout of our beauty department to make it more enjoyable for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our employees, who will be ready to give advice.
With our range of brands, we offer something for everyone, and thanks to the attractive environment and convenient locations, we make sure that our customers like to buy their beauty products from us, and no longer shop in the old way.'
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby pulls out of <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragons Den, is "angry" because TV presenter Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle company. She wants to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for Truly, their brand for homewear and accessories.
The company of Jones and Willoughby is sometimes compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning announced on Instagram that she is leaving.
Peter Jones of Dragons Den is furious with Holly Willoughby for having withdrawn from their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was “enraged” when Willoughby announced Tuesday during a difficult meeting at the company’s headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire that her new contracts (worth as much as <0xC2><0xA3>1.5m) would not leave enough time for Truly, their homewear and accessories brand.
The company is sometimes compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby’s fortune of an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she would leave Truly, Jones left for one of his vacation rentals abroad.
A source said: “Truly was one of Holly’s top priorities.
It would insure her long-term future, and yield enough for the next decades.
Everyone was stunned when she decided to retire.
No one could believe his ears last Tuesday, because the launch was scheduled for soon.
The warehouse at the Marlow headquarters is full of ready-to-sell products.”
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter, one of Britain’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions, due to the large investments in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear, and because the launch could now come with further delays.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, became President of the company in March.
The two couples often go on vacation together and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby will soon become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source in Jones’s entourage said last night, “We have no comment on his business affairs.”
It was hard language, and then there was love between us.
He joked about the criticism he would get in the media for a comment he made that some people would find “unfavourable for a president,” and for his positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump imitated a news anchor when he said:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He added that Kim is interested in a second meeting. Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step towards dismantling nuclear weapons in North Korea.
But negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons have stalled.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea sees no “corresponding reaction” by the United States after North Korea’s first disarmament initiatives.
Meanwhile, the United States is continuing its sanctions to keep pressure on the boiler, he says.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech during the election rally.
“We are doing very well in North Korea,” he said.
“We were close to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship.”
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have led to positive results. The missile tests have ended, the hostages have been liberated and the material surpluses of U.S. soldiers have returned to their own country.
He also defended his unusual approach to his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave like a president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to access this busy arena, there would be about 200 people standing here,” Trump said, pointing to the audience in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroys an island, killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok no longer had a home, no national disaster was declared, which is a prerequisite for starting international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, it is clear that they are not requesting international aid, which is difficult for us,” said Ms Sumbung.
Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, but it is not certain whether the aid providers from abroad will be able to work on site.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Relief Agency, said Indonesian officials were still evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organizations would be allowed to help.
Although Indonesia is constantly plagued by earthquakes, the country is still particularly ill-prepared for the wrath of nature.
In Aceh, shelters were built to shelter from tsunamis, but along other coasts you rarely see them.
The absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, even though a warning was in force, has likely contributed to the death toll.
Even under ideal conditions, it can be difficult to travel from one Indonesian island to another.
National disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship docked in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days for the ship to reach the site of the disaster.
The improvement of Indonesia’s untapped infrastructure was one of the key points of President Joko Widodo’s election campaign, and he has already spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the government of President Joko is facing a shortage of funding, and that while he hopes to be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also being pressured by ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority today follow a previously conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to leave their homes because Christian and Islamic gangs fought on the streets, with machetes, arrows and bows and other primitive weapons.
Watch: Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge delivers impressive equaliser against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool last Saturday for a loss to Chelsea in the Premier League, with a goal in the 89th minute, during a match at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was at a distance of about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal, at the time his team was behind 1-0.
He tapped the ball to the left and then kicked in the direction of the furthest pole.
The ball flew high above the penalty area, in the direction of the upper right corner of the net.
He escaped the jump of Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“It was very difficult to reach that position, to reach the ball, and players like Shaq always play as far forward as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante approaching and dared to try. I didn’t really think about it, I just kicked the ball.”
Chelsea were at rest 1-0 ahead, after a goal by Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues tip kicked the ball with his heel to Mateo Kovacic, after which he rushed through the midfield to Liverpool's half.
Kovacic made a quick one-two on the midfield.
Then he gave a nice pass, which allowed Hazard to reach the penal area.
Hazard was faster than the defense and kicked the ball with his left foot past Liverpool's Alisson Becker in the net, next to the rear pole.
Liverpool will play in the group stage of the Champions League against Napoli at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy on Wednesday at 3 p.m.
Chelsea will take on Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the national disaster relief agency said Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the debris of buildings that had collapsed as a result of last Friday’s 7.5-magnitude earthquake, which also generated waves 6 meters high, spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, where more than 380,000 people live, is full of debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman stabbed to death
This morning, the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead in Merseyside, after which a murder investigation was opened.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 a.m. in Grayson Mews on John Street. The body showed puncture wounds. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police are asking the locals to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Police inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation has only just begun, but I would like to ask anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, to contact us if they may have filmed something via a dashcam, as they may have information that is essential to our research.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found is a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman on the spot came to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police have confirmed that they are currently informing the victim’s family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to enter his apartment, but was told by police that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
The residents are now told that it will take hours before they can return home.
A policeman would have told someone that the area is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared crying on the spot.
She keeps repeating, “What a pity!”
At 2 p.m., two police cars were inside the depot and a third was just outside.
Within the ambush, a number of police officers were monitoring the apartment building.
Anyone with information is asked to send a message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111, stating log 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell statue at British Parliament is latest victim of 'rewriting history' riot
The banishment of the statue would be a poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of the many cultural and religious artefacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick’s suggestion as “stupid” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that the current debate on the removal of statues would lead to the aiming of Oliver Cromwell’s figure just outside the Houses of Parliament.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
The magnificent image of Cromwell, created by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, testifies to the opinion that prevailed in the 19th century and is part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe still needs to be recognized.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether that is a completely correct idea is still debated.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure who represents one side of that gulf.
His accomplishments as Lord Protector must also be recognized and commemorated.”
Pig Kills Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, known only by the surname ‘Yuan’, was found dead at a stable in the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province. His artery had been pierced and he was under the blood, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing for the vaccination of pigs at a pig farm, on 30 May 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He was reportedly travelling with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and found a door to a neighboring pig farm open.
According to the nephew, a large male pig with blood on its mouth was in the pork choke.
A forensic investigation revealed that the 250 kg pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bleeding and maimed,” said the nephew named ‘Wu’, according to the Guiyang Evening News newspaper.
Surveillance camera footage shows Yuan arriving at the market at 4.40am on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not from Yuan or his cousin.
A market official told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking others, while police collected evidence on the spot.
Yuan’s family and market authorities are reportedly currently negotiating compensation for his death.
It rarely happens, but there have been cases of pigs attacking people before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, injuring the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300-kg pig pushed a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife threw the animal away.
When an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer testified to CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood can trigger aggression.
“They’re just playful.
They're like children, very curious... they're not out to hurt people.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa's tail brings heavy rain to southwestern U.S.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it has reached the cooler waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring heavy rains to northern Mexico and the southwest in the coming days.
At a wind speed of 135 km per hour, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane at 5 a.m. local time on Sunday morning and was located 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough begins to form above the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, tropical humidity is pushed northward, to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring 10 centimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Next, tropical moisture that reacts with the approaching trough will cause widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 2 to 10 cm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical moisture will lead to precipitation of 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
5 to 10 cm of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially over most of Arizona.
Sudden flooding is possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions, as the tropical rain can fall very widely.
It is strongly discouraged to enter the desert on foot when the tropical rain threatens.
The heavy rainfall can turn ravines into savage rivers, and storms will produce local wind gusts and dust.
The approaching trough brings some heavy rain locally to parts of Southern California's coastline.
Rain of 1.5 cm is possible, which could lead to small debris flows and smooth roads.
This would be the region’s first rainfall in the rainy season.
Scattered tropical rains will approach Arizona on Sunday evening until Monday morning, after which the rains will be more scattered Monday end of day and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread across the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue to fall until Wednesday.
In October, the temperature in the US can fluctuate strongly, as the North Pole becomes cooler, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes leads to large temperature differences over short distances.
There is a nice example of impressive temperature differences in the middle of the U.S. on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is almost 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the persistent summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
In much of the central and eastern U.S., October is expected to start hot, with temperatures anywhere fluctuating around 30°C, from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York, it can get 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees warmer than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that the chance until mid-October is high at above-average temperatures in the eastern United States.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on one of six television networks the gripping testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, a U.S. Supreme Court candidate, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of an assault allegedly taking place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued as broadcasters interrupted regular programming for Friday’s surprise: an agreement arranged by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to investigate the indictment for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that a drunk Kavanaugh teased her and tried to take off her clothes during a high school party.
Kavanaugh stated in a spirited testimony that he was 100 percent sure this had not happened.
More than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen were likely to have watched Friday.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures were not immediately available for the other networks that broadcast the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people looking in an office.
For comparison: that’s about like a play-off of a football match or for the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, which endorses Kavanaugh’s appointment, had the most viewers during the day of the hearing: an average of 5.69 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
ABC followed with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers, and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
Even after the hearing, the public remained very interested.
Flake was the central figure of the events on Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican issued a statement that he would support Kavanaugh with his voice, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning recorded protesters shouting at him as he tried to take the elevator to a hearing of the Justice Commission.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes while being taunted, live on CNN.
“I’m right in front of you,” one woman said.
“Do you think he’s telling the people the truth?
Someone shouted, “You have power, while so many women are powerless.”
Flake said that his office had issued a statement, and just before the elevator closed, he added that he would say more during the hearing.
The various channels broadcast everything live when the judicial committee had to vote hours later on Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate.
But Flake said he would only vote for it on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee by next week, something the Democrats of the minority insist on.
Flake was convinced, among other things, by his friend Chris Coons, Senator and Democrat.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and several senators.
Flake's choice was important, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'a political game' around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians who criticized her plans to leave the European Union of “a political game” with Britain’s future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, on the same front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stressed his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying her proposal to collect UK and EU charges from each other was ‘absurd’.
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson as Suspect of LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a suspect for the shooting in which Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU, was shot dead.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and is in prison on suspicion of murder, Baton Rouge police said.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and police said Sims lost their glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene of the crime and found Simpson’s DNA on the glasses, reports WAFB, a CBS television station.
The police interrogated Simpson and later stated that he had confessed that he had shot Wayde with the result of death.
His bail is set at $350,000, the lawyer reports.
The bodyguard of the East Baton Rouge community on Friday published a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The report states that the Fugitive Task Force of the Louisiana State Police, the state police crime lab, Southern University police and local residents have all contributed to the investigation that led to an arrest.
Sports director Joe Alleva of LSU thanked the local police for his “devotion and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
He was 198 cm tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "hooded" and "in shock" by Wayde's death.
“This is an event that you always hope will never happen,” Wade says.
Volcano spewing as on Mexico City
The ash spewed by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern districts of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans last Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after activity in the crater was picked up and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded over a 24-hour period.
The center detected multiple rumblings and vibrations.
On social media, photos of a thin layer of ash appeared on car windows in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity in the volcano, which is located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, for the first time since September 2017, when an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.1 hit the Richter scale of central Mexico.
The volcano, called Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence activists clashed with riot police, while thousands participated in rival demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the independence vote in Catalonia that split the region into two groups.
A group of masked pro-separatists who were stopped by riot police shelled the officers with eggs and powder paint, creating dark dust clouds in the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Later in the day, screencasts broke out with the police, and the officers pulled up their knuckles to stop the fighting.
For more than an hour, pro-independence groups chanted, “Don’t forget, don’t forgive,” while their opponents shouted “Long live Spain.”
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries they sustained during the protests, the local press reported.
Tensions continue to mount in the independence-minded region, a year after the October 1 referendum, which is considered illegal by Madrid but is celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly expressed their desire to become independent, although the turnout was low and the people opposed to secession boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote at the polling stations in the region, resulting in violent screenings.
Pro-independence groups had camped on the spot on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but they were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful about Catalonia’s prospects of becoming independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry for joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although the Catalan pro-independence parties won an essential victory in the regional elections in December, even if it was a snap, this year it was difficult for them to build on their success. Many of their best-known leaders are absent, either in self-imposed exile or in captivity, in anticipation of their role in exile and incarceration.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protest in support of police on his phone, said the conflict was sparked by politicians on both sides.
“The tensions are getting higher and higher,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in pretrial detention since the end of last year, declared that he will take part in the European Parliament elections next year.
“A candidacy for the European elections is the best way to complain about the decline in democratic values and repression that we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house was rammed with a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car was repeatedly rammed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred around 7:30 p.m. local time on Thursday in Ballynagard Crescent.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself had been damaged.
It is also possible that at some point a crossbow was fired on the car.
Livingston wins 1-0 against Rangers thanks to Menga's goal
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston gave them the win
The promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers and delivered Steven Gerrard his second defeat in a series of 18 games since he was manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference and Gary Holt's team came to stand on equal footing with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team failed to win an outing this season during the Premiership, and they have to take Sunday against leader Hearts, who is eight points ahead of them.
But first, the Rangers will receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
The team has already won six consecutive games in its division, and coach Holt has not suffered a single defeat since he had Kenny Miler replaced last month.
Livingston misses chances against strong visitors
Holt's team had long before the first goal achieved a lead, as their direct way of playing caused all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but failed to finish with a goal, then Alan Lithgow, who picked up Craig Halkett's header, kicked the ball above the goal.
The home team let the Rangers play with great fun, and waited for his chances calmly and confidently.
And that ultimately led to the crucial goal.
Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create an opportunity for Menga, who scored from the penalty area, and the Rangers scored from the penalty area.
At that time, the Rangers had been in possession of the ball for a long time, but the defense of the home team was inviolable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not have much to do.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos made sure that Kelly had to avoid a goal.
Scott Pittman kicked the ball at the feet of Rangers goaltender Allan McGregor and Lithgow missed the goal after a move by his Livingston colleagues.
Continuously reaching the penal area of Livingston, but they were refused each time. Twice a penal area was refused, one after Halkett's attack on invader Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
Livingston's "phenomenal" analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal achievement and result for Livingston.
They played without exception excellently and continue to exceed expectations in their race to the top.
Their playing style and team composition has hardly changed since their return to the highest regions, but especially Holt deserves a lot of recognition for the way he has swept the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Leader Halkett was fantastic, with an excellently organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall walked on top of their toes throughout the game.
However, the Rangers were unable to break through.
Although they have often played very well under Gerrard, this time they did not reach their usual level.
Their final stage was not good enough (they only managed to knock out the home team once) and the Rangers will now realize that they need to play better because they are somewhere in the middle of the standings.
Erdogan to be greeted with mixed feelings in Cologne
Under a radiant blue sky and with a broad smile, the leaders of Turkey and Germany went to breakfast together in Berlin on Saturday (September 29th).
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They do not agree on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne for the opening of a gigantic new mosque.
Cologne is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police relied on security reasons when they barred the crowd of 25,000 people from gathering for the mosque, but many sympathizers came nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of demonstrators, many of them Kurds, also made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The rival protests reflect the division over a visitor who is praised by some German Turks as a hero and accused by others as an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after collision with car
In London, a cyclist was killed in a collision involving a car.
The accident happened near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, at about 10.15 a.m. local time.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance personnel were present, but the man died on the spot.
A few months ago, another cyclist died in an accident involving flight delinquency on Childers Street, about a mile and a half from Saturday’s accident.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working on identifying the man and will inform his immediate family.
The road is closed in several places, buses are diverted and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Jail: Six Cypriots Wounded in Order Disruption
Six cipiers were injured in a breach of order in a heavily secured men's prison, according to the prison office.
The riots erupted around 9.30am local time at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Specialised ‘Tornado’ vessels have been deployed to resolve a situation involving eight prisoners in one unit.
The cipiers were treated there for minor injuries to the face.
A prison spokesman said: “Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed for a current incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and those responsible are at least referred to the police and may have to stay behind bars for longer."
HMP Long Lartin is home to more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director was treated at the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot police were called to prison for a serious breach of order in which personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (with possible positive effects for drought areas)
It rarely happens that a tropical depression reaches Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen early next week, because the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa is moving across the southwest of the desert area, which carries risks of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings for Monday and Tuesday of sudden flooding for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, and southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to be just above Phoenix on Tuesday, with rain starting on Monday evening.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that ‘since 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression in the 200-mile area of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation, with isolated amounts up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the southwest of the desert area, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive 3 to 5 cm of rain, and here and there 10 cm is possible.
For areas that are not at risk of flooding, the rain from Rosa can be a blessing, because the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is very worrying, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial, as the southwest is currently experiencing a drought.
“According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the map showing current drought areas, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second highest category,” the report said.
Hurricane Rosa reaches the mainland via the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa is still at hurricane strength on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 140 km per hour, is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving northward at a speed of 20 km per hour.
The storm hits cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, weakening them.
Therefore, it is expected to arrive in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening with the force of a tropical storm.
Heavy rains can fall in parts of Mexico, which poses a significant flood risk.
“A total rainfall of 8 to 15 cm is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with up to 25 cm possible,” weather.com reported.
Rosa moves north across Mexico like a tropical storm before reaching the border with Arizona in the early hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona late Tuesday night and into southern Utah.
“The biggest danger expected from Rosa or her tail is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest of Sonora, and southwest of the desert area,” the National Hurricane Center said.
This rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and devastation in the deserts and landslides on mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four arrests on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured Saturday at about 4 a.m. local time in the Excelsior Terrace neighborhood of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is “stable”.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset police.
The police are asking anyone who may have filmed something of what happened to report it.
Trump says Kavanaugh “suffered from the community, the anger” of the Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the relentless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that during his nomination process, Kavanaugh constantly “suffered from the community, the anger” of the Democratic Party.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday and strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford’s allegation that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the hearing about her indictment.
The president said on Saturday that the “American people saw “the splendid and incredible character, the quality and the courage” of Kavanaugh that day.
“A vote to recognize Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that recognizes one of the most fulfilled legal opinions of our time, a lawyer with an excellent standing of service,” he told the crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the Republican uprising in the midterm elections.
“In five weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives will take place.
“I don’t participate, but I do participate,” he said.
“That’s why I stand up everywhere for great candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats are on a mission to “resist and hinder us.”
The first major procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s appointment is expected to take place by Friday, a top GOP executive told CNN.
Hundreds Killed by Indonesian Earthquake, Tsunami, and Toll Rises
A major earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi killed at least 384 people, many of whom were wiped off the ground when gigantic waves crashed on the beach, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu, when waves of up to six meters high landed at the time it started to twilight. Many people collapsed and the waves destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami was the result of an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, there were still people on the beach. They did not walk away immediately and thus became victims of the tsunami,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster relief agency BNPB during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami also led to other dangers: he towed cars, tree trunks, houses, he hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled at a speed of 800 km/h across the open sea before it reached the coastline.
Some people climbed a tree to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster relief agency show that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges have been twisted and collapsed, and a mosque has been surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city continued to be shaken by aftershocks.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s massive earthquake was about 200 times the force of the atomic bomb that had fallen on Hiroshima in World War II.
It is possible that the geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, has further increased the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as “significant” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
Some fatalities were trapped under the debris of collapsed buildings, he said. Some 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage could be even greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
The communication with Donggala “is completely flat, we have no information at all,” Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that Red Cross staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse,” the Red Cross said.
The organization received much criticism on Saturday for not saying a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves had reached the country within the time the warning had been given.
In amateur images shared on social media, one can hear a man on the upper floor of a building screaming at people on the street downstairs to warn them that a tsunami is coming.
Minutes later, a wall of water collapses on the coast and buildings and cars are swept away.
Reuters could not immediately verify the images.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army is currently sending cargo planes with relief goods from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuees still urgently need food and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport is only reopened for relief and will remain closed to the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Tsunami death toll rises above 800.
It's very, very bad.
While World Vision employees from Donggala have arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees in the courtyard of their office seek shelter in tents of blankets, they passed scenes of devastation along the way, Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses that were destroyed,” he said.
It's very, very bad.
Even when aid groups began the difficult task of launching emergency aid, some complained that certain foreign aid providers with great expertise could not travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financing, goods and personnel from abroad can only be allowed if the location of a disaster is declared as a national natural disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘O.K., this is a national disaster,’ we can provide international assistance, but that status has still not been declared.”
When the second night after Friday's earthquake and tsunami fell on Palu, friends and family of the missing remained hopeful that they would find their loved ones' lives back, as in the miracles that people so much love to hear in terrible natural disasters like this.
On Saturday, a boy was taken out of a sewer.
On Sunday, aid workers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which had taken place earlier this month in Indonesia.
His students were also trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi.
“As a veteran in the paragliding world, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon said that the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed had spread to the paragliding community and that he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the athletes in Palu, who participated in the beach festival in the hours after.
However, in his messages, only one gray tick appeared instead of two blue ticks.
“I think that means the messages haven’t been delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while supplying ATMs in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was filling up a cash machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from Newport police.
The driver had just emptied a cash machine into the entertainment complex and wanted to fill it with money, Inspector Dennis McCarthy wrote in the message.
When he was busy, another man ran behind Brink’s employee and stole a bag of money that was ready to be delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing, the press release said, but police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about the identity of the perpetrators is requested to contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Last Saturday, he announced the change on Twitter with the words: “The creature formally known as Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West has been briefly called Ye for a while and used this nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The name change was announced ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who has cancelled her performance during the show for “emotional reasons,” the show’s creator says.
Ye is not only an abbreviation of his current artist name, but West has already said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
In my opinion, “yes” is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means “you,” West said earlier this year, when he told radio presenter Big Boy about the title of his album.
“So I am you, I am us, we are it.
I switched from Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, to just Ye, a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are.”
He's not the only famous rapper who changes his name.
Sean Combs used to be known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously worked with West, has also worked with and without the link sign and the capital letters.
Mexican President vows not to use military force against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the president-elect of Mexico, has promised to never use military power against civilians. The country is on the eve of the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use military force to repress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, military forces fired at a peaceful protest in the square, killing up to 300 people, during which time leftist student movements emerged throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to help young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that young people often join criminal gangs due to unemployment and a lack of opportunities to study.
U.S. to double A.I. funding
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States must double the amount it spends on AI research, says investor and AI specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for all of Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He says this in response to the announcements about AI coming from various departments of the U.S. government, despite the fact that the U.S. does not have a formal strategy for AI.
Meanwhile, China announced its plan last year: the country wants to be number 1 in terms of AI innovations by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for AI research would already be a good start, given the fact that all other countries are so far behind the US, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
A doubling of funding could lead to a doubling of the chances of the next big achievement for AI taking place in the U.S., Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China’s leading AI companies.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that defeated American Othello's best player, and later served as Microsoft Research manager and President of Google's Chinese division.
Lee expressed appreciation for technology competitions organized by the U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next competition would take place, as it would help to discover the next visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers often have to work hard to get government subsidies, Lee said.
“China doesn’t pick up our best academics, companies do,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have recruited the best forces from universities to work on AI.
Lee said U.S. AI efforts would also benefit from a change in immigration policy.
“Anyone who is a doctor in the field of A.I. should automatically be offered a green card,” he said.
The Chinese National Council released its next-generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese Foundation for Natural Sciences gives financial support to employees of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, intended to involve industry and academia partners in the initiative, and announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that $2 billion would be invested in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF is currently investing more than $100 million in research into A.I.
However, U.S. legislation that should lead to the establishment of a National Security Committee for Artificial Intelligence has been in the works for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on possible name change of their country
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on the possible change of the name of their country to ‘Republic of North Macedonia’. This would resolve a dispute with Greece that has been dragging on for decades and Greece would no longer be the Macedonian application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province that is also called Macedonia, and says that the name of its northern neighbor means that the country claims Greek territory. As a result, Greece vetoed the inclusion of Macedonia in the European Union and NATO.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalists believe the name change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he will not vote in the referendum and through a boycott campaign it is not certain that the required turnout of at least 50 percent will be achieved, so the referendum may not be valid.
The question on the ballot is as follows: ‘Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?’
“Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the price to be paid is worth trying to join bodies like the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that emerged when the former Yugoslavia broke up.
“I come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that will lead to a safer life for all of us,” said the 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, enough MEPs have indicated that they will respect the outcome, making it decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The National Electoral Commission said there had been no reports of irregularities at 1 p.m.
However, the turnout at the time was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters came to vote.
“I come to vote because it’s important for my children. Our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, during the referendum on the name change of the country that would pave the way for NATO and European Union membership.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage and placed chairs for tents that had been placed by people who boycotted the referendum.
“We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to participate as a full member, and not through a back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of the European-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will provide much-needed investment for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I am convinced that the vast majority is in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said that a “yes” as a result would be “a confirmation of our future.”
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research found that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, less than the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by the hot Macedonian TV station Telma TV, concluded that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of that, 70 percent would vote yes.
If the referendum is to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it came to power in May last year.
Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes full defence of Brighton and scores
On Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made a short match with the defence of Brighton at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England. Manchester City won the match 2-0.
It looked like a penny whistle, as Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian spike first got the ball played on the midfield.
He raced between three Brighton defenders, straight into the open field.
There, Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He managed to pass a defender and was also too fast for some others on the edge of the penal area of Brighton.
Then he gave a pass to the left, where Sterling was waiting.
The English striker used his first action in the penalty area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right shoe to beat goaltender Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
“Aguero has problems with his feet,” Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We decided to let him play 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the first advantage in the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball when he was deep in the Brighton playing field.
He sent a beautiful pass along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball for a while and then sent Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues player tapped the ball just before it was too far.
City will play against Hoffenheim at 12.55 pm on Tuesday in the group stage of the Champions League. The match will take place in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play along and not make it easy for the Rockies to reach the playoffs
Now that the Washington Nationals have been eliminated for the playoffs, there was not much reason to force a new start.
However, the always competitive Scherzer hopes to play against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are consequences for the Rockies' participation in the playoffs. They are currently one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have secured at least one wild card for the playoffs thanks to their 5-2 win over the Nationals last Friday, but are still working hard to secure their first division title.
“Although there is nothing left for us, we can at least pitch with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver will be optimal with this audience and the other team is probably playing at the highest level that I would encounter this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to play in it?”
The Nationals have yet to announce who will be on Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to put Scherzer on the pitch in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, was in the pitch Thursday and would still pitch next Sunday, although that is normally his rest day.
Washington's right-handed pitcher stands at 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strike-outs in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump organizes meeting in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court, while he spoke about the importance of the Republican uprising in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve achieved is at stake in November.
In five weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives will take place.
This is one of the really big elections. I don't take part, but actually I do take part. That's why I'm coming up for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued, “We see a terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, we see it happening now.
And they are determined to take back power, no matter what they have to do for it. You see the community, the abomination.
It doesn't matter who they hurt, who they have to push away to get power and control. That's what they want: power and control, but we won't give them that."
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to “resist and hinder us.”
“And we’ve seen that over the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry and mean and false and lying.”
He named the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which led to loud shouts from the public.
“Do you know what she answered?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, eh no, I'm waiting for one... that was really a bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
The party is intolerant of people who say what they think
When the activists of Momentum voted in my local party to censor me, that was no surprise.
Finally, I am the latest in a whole series of Labour MEPs who have been told that we are not welcome simply because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received a similar treatment because she was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was punished with the motion for censorship because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically enough similar issues such as this where Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated: “We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
And that was so during most of the GC meetings on Friday evening during the eight years that I was already a local Labour MP.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings today and the promise of a ‘kinder, softer’ policy has long been forgotten, if it had ever started.
It is becoming increasingly clear that a divergent opinion is not tolerated in the Labour Party and any opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership or not.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, and colleagues who, as far as I knew, had a similar political view as I did, suddenly expected me to turn around and take a position that I would never otherwise have agreed to, from issues such as national security to the European single market.
Whenever I speak for an audience, whatever I say, there are social media insults calling for the rejection of my candidacy as a Member of Parliament for the next election, blaming the centre's policies and telling me that I should not be a member of Labour.
And that's just what I'm going through.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments addressed to me are generally political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who are dealing with a flood of sexist or racist reactions every day, but do not allow themselves to be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is that serious insults are apparently considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every ‘motion of distrust’ or change of selection rules, the party becomes pettyr.
Over the past two years, I have often been advised to keep myself informed, not just to express my opinion out loud and then I wouldn’t ‘get into trouble’.
But I didn’t go into politics for that.
Since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a schoolchild, provoked by the neglect of Thatcher’s government that literally collapsed my classroom, I have always advocated for better public services for those who need them most, both in my role as a city councillor and in my role as a minister.
I never hid my politics, not even in the last election.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clarity about my policy stances and my points of contention with current leadership.
To those who have propagated the motion on Friday, I can only say one thing: when the country is dragging itself into a Brexit that will hurt families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, I have only one message, and it is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that threats to reject my candidacy as a Member of Parliament for the next election will follow me or political opportunities will not stop me from doing what you are doing.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: undefeated Ayr on his way to the top
Two late tries may have made the end result a bit sloppy, but there’s no doubt Ayr is right to triumph in this delicious game of the day in the Tennent’s Premiership.
They are now at the top of the standings, the only undefeated team in the top ten.
In the end, it was both their superior defense and their better chances that gave the home team the victory, and coach Peter Murchie was pleased.
“We’ve had a tough time in our games so far and we’re still undefeated, so I’m a happy man,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose: “Honours to Ayr, they’ve used their chances better than us.”
Grant Anderson's try in the 14th minute, completed by Frazier Climo, led to a lead for Ayr, but by a yellow card from Rory Hughes of the Scottish national team (which he received during the game of the Warriors) Melrose was able to get the numbers to speak and Jason Baggot was able to try out.
With a penalty, Climo secured an extra lead for Ayr and scored a conversion after a solo try just before the rest, making it 17-5 for Ayr after the first half.
But Melrose started the second half well and the try of Patrick Anderson, followed by a conversion of Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
The match was long silent before a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried off on a brancard, and as soon as the match was restarted, Ayr was able to run further through a try by Stafford McDowall followed by a conversion by Climo.
Then Commander Blair Macpherson of Ayr got a yellow card, and again Melrose settled with the extra man when no conversion followed a try by Bruce Colvine at the end of a game where the pressure was very high.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card because he tackled Climo without the ball, MacPherson provided a touch-down to the penalty line-out behind the advancing Ayr maul.
Climo made the conversion, and did so almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent Gregor Henry away for the home team's fifth try.
Star of Still Game is ready for a new career in the restaurant world
It looks like Actor Ford Kieran from Still Game is going into the catering business. Apparently he has been appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and in which he himself acts with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official data, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the story, but a source from the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was looking for a way to participate in Glasgow’s ‘blossoming restaurant business’.
'The sea is ours': landlocked Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrolling in a rigged naval office in La Paz.
At public buildings, an ocean blue flag is waving.
On all naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the motto is: ‘The sea is ours.
It’s a duty to win them back.”
Throughout the land-locked Bolivia, the memory of the coastline that the country had to give to Chile after a bloody nineteenth-century raw materials conflict is still alive, as is the desire to sail the Pacific again.
That hope may have reached its highest point in recent decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice, which should fall on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course looks forward to the result with positive prospects,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will view the Court’s ruling on large screens, in the hope that the tribunal in The Hague will plead in favor of Bolivia that Chile, after decades of spicy talks, is obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the sea.
Also for Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is facing a controversial fight for re-election next year, much is at stake with Monday’s ruling.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he vowed at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in favor of Bolivia, and even if it were, little would change.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands does not have the power to grant Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The ruling of the International Court of Justice comes just six months after the final appeals, indicating that the case was “uncomplicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And the prospects for a positive outcome from Bolivia have certainly not improved, on the contrary, over the last four years the situation may have even worsened.
“The case of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian government,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales’ warlike rhetoric has completely undermined all the goodwill that Chile may yet have had, she claimed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their talks at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to talk further afterwards.
The two countries have not had ambassadors in each other’s countries since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in The Hague, denies that the court’s decision was taken unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of international relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end 139 years of disagreements, with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, uses the maritime issue as a political stool.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific,” he added.
“The verdict is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never remove its nuclear weapons if it can’t trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on promises made during a summit between the leaders of rivals in Singapore.
He said this at a time when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears on the verge of restarting stalled nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the summit in Singapore with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it’s a “utopia” that the ongoing sanctions and U.S. objection to a declaration ending the Korean war will one day get North Korea on its knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang first taking important steps in the area of disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is skepticism and doubt that Pyongyang is serious about saying it would give up an arsenal that the country probably sees as its only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest collection of huge headgear, soon for sale near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or want to keep the sun out of your eyes, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a series of crazy oversized headgear for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, a striking move during Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats were not to be thought of this summer from Instagram and these designers have sent their dazzling creations on the catwalk.
The striking piece of Valentino was a giant beige hat decorated with a four-faced wide rim, which hung over the eyes of the models.
Other oversized accessories were watermelons lined with gemstones, a magic hat, and even a pineapple, but those aren’t designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a selection of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
With many of the colorful masks, the lips were sewn close. They looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation looked like diving gear, complete with snorkel and glasses, while the other one looked like a melted ice cream.
And if you want to follow this daring fashion, you are in luck.
Style watchers predict that the huge hats will find their way to the clothing stores near you.
The giant hats may have been inspired by 'La Bomba', the scattered hat with a two-metre wide rim that everyone wears, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat that popped up everywhere on social media also created another great creation on the catwalk: a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the model in bathing suit that wore the bag.
The red-orange raffia bag, lined with raffia fringes and finished with a white leather handle, was the most striking piece in Jacquemus’ La Riviera SS19 collection during Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the shops next summer. Since the designer has made such a huge impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for extra large accessories."
John Edward: Language Skills Essential for Global Citizens
The independent schools in Scotland have an excellent state of service in the field of academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with again a series of excellent exam results, and in addition individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community-wide initiatives.
With more than 30,000 pupils in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their pupils for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain popular and desirable subjects ideally within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to someone in a language they understand, you reach their head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you reach his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we can’t rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent exam results, we can deduce that languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest success rates within independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a high score.
The data, collected from 74 schools affiliated with SCIS, shows that 72 percent of students achieved a high score (‘A’) in Mandarin, while 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students also achieved an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now valued as highly skilled as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school programs and elsewhere.
A 2014 study by the UK’s Employment and Skills Commission found that of the obstacles to filling vacancies, 17 percent were attributed to a lack of language skills, according to employers.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
Now that more and more job vacancies require language skills, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career that a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with such a skill for life.
Communicating directly with people from abroad automatically gives a multilingual person a competitive edge.
According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation. French was the only language that stood out above the 10 percent, with a total of 15 percent.
This is why investing in language education is important for children today.
Being able to speak several languages, especially those of emerging economies, will give children a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, schools choose which languages they teach.
Some schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while other schools will teach languages that are most important to the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be different languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers who specialize in this area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills needed to succeed, regardless of the future.
It cannot currently be denied that languages remain vital for the future of the country in a global business environment, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be considered as ‘international communication skills.’
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
You have to do it right.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes his Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday
Fans waiting for the first game of LeBron James at the Los Angeles Lakers, the wait is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday in the opening game ahead of the season.
It remains to be determined how many minutes he will play.
“There will be more than one, and fewer than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said in a tweet that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' schedule for the six games prior to the season.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare,” he said.
Trump's election rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump Begins Tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, at a Long Series of Election Rallyes
It is Trump’s first of five planned rallies in the coming week, including stops in places he’s been inclined to, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote on the nominee he chooses for the Supreme Court job has been put on hold, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when it votes in November.
What time does the Trump rally in West Virginia start tonight and how do you watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, begins tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia online via the livestream on YouTube.
Trump will likely be talking about this week’s hearings for candidate-supervisor Brett Kavanaugh. These were extra charged now that Kavanaugh is being accused of sexual misconduct and the Senate may wait a week to vote on his appointment as the FBI investigates the case.
But the main goal of this series of rallies is to help the Republicans who are candidates for the November election gain more momentum.
President Trump’s campaign leadership said these five rallies next week were meant to “incentivize volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Control over Congress is so important to his program that the president travels to as many states as possible now that the busy campaign season begins,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
The rally tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be discussed in the Pittsburgh media, West Virginia Metro News said.
Saturday marks the second time in a month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 by more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him a boost in the polls,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is ready to fight to keep hope alive in the run-up to Sunday’s singles
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon’s foursomes were perhaps just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging sling of chances is a completely invented sports concept, but one that players really believe in, and especially in competitions like this.
So who gets the best chances right now?
“They had a six-point lead at first, and now that’s only four more, so we find it a little bit that happiness is on our side right now,” Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage of having four points in front of them, while there are still twelve at stake.
The Americans find, as Spieth said, that they have a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that give courage, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and scored three points out of four.
Spieth has been a fearsome opponent from tee to green and he sets the good example.
The typical throat sounds he makes when he plays well became louder as his round progressed and he achieved a crucial well with which match four became a success when he and Thomas were two points behind after two matches.
His well with which they won the match at 15 was followed by a similar scream, the kind from which you can deduce that he believes the American team has not yet been defeated.
“You have to dig deep and only worry about your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all these players can do now.
18 holes to stamp your stamp.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
This strange but delicious European duo has four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
‘Moliwood’ was the only duo that did not play bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning they avoided bogey’s.
As a result of that series, and the way they seem to exchange energy with their noisy audience, they are the players who need to be defeated on Sunday. If Fleetwood or Molinari wins, he will be the most popular player ever to book a European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at different holes at the same time.
However, it is premature to speak of a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short measurements with Sergio Garcia, the fourball hero of that morning, when he formed a duo with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine led to a setback for the Spaniard and the Swede that they could no longer overcome.
However, on Sunday there is no one who can help you make up for your backlog.
The four-balls and foursomes are so fascinating to see through the interactions between the duos, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and the way a strategy can change at a glance.
The European team has played best so far and has a nice lead in the run-up to the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that Team USA is ready to start the fight, something that some, especially in the US, doubt.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts with a nice lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup. After the four-balls and foursomes of Saturday they are 10-6 ahead of the United States.
The animated duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led their team with two victories more than Tiger Woods, who had a hard time, making them four points ahead in Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who wants the trophy she lost two years ago in Hazeltine back, was stronger than the blundering Americans in the four-balls in the morning, with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, where it won two games, but was unable to catch up.
Jim Furyk’s team must score eight points during Sunday’s 12 singles matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who were dubbed ‘Molliwood’ after a sensational weekend, are only the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup to win four points in their four opening matches.
After putting Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, they were beautifully matched and defeated a disappointing Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with a powerful 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, occasionally showed a splendid set, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-balls and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, equipped for the four-balls of the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and together they defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three of the world, with 2&1.
Yet it didn’t run from a muddy roof for Europe on this pleasant day with a breeze southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who has already won the Major three times, and Justin Thomas set the standard for the Americans by three points on Saturday.
They won after a difficult match with 2&1 from Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in the foursomes, after losing the first four holes.
It has only happened twice before in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has been able to overcome a four-point deficit at the start of the singles, although Furyk's team has had enough of a tie, as they currently hold the trophy.
But now that they have been in second place for two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems too high.
North Korea says it will “in no case” unilaterally disarm without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions are leading to growing distrust in the United States and that the country would in no case be able to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN’s annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “important goodwill measures” over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the site for nuclear tests, and promising not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We don’t see a similar reaction from the United States,” he said.
“Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves.”
Although Ri repeated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s opposition to a “phased” approach to denuclearization, which would reward North Korea as it takes further steps, it was noted that he did not reject unilateral denuclearization a priori, as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first-ever summit between an active U.S. president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim vowed to work toward “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea’s security.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on ‘denuclearization first’ and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling way and even by objecting to the ‘declaration of the end of war,’” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an air castle of people who are unaware of us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions only strengthen our mistrust.”
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, something the US leader said at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the other party on this issue was South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be an implicit one.”
Yet the tone of Ri’s speech was significantly different than last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korean missiles would be aimed at the American mainland after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “rocketman” on a suicide mission.
Trump, who last year threatened to completely destroy North Korea, praised Kim this year at the United Nations for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said much still needs to happen and that sanctions should continue until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn’t have a timeline: “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday, “The enforcement of the Security Council’s sanctions must continue vigorously and reliably until we have achieved the full, final, verified denuclearization.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions against North Korea to significantly reduce funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo had a meeting with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
Just hours after he left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, North Korea warned him of making “walk-like demands.”
North Korea promised this month during a meeting with Moon to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States would take “corresponding measures.”
He said Kim had told him that the “corresponding measures” he wanted were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore, and steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on the importance of sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University this year ensures that all students get more sleep, in an effort to combat the growing macho culture in which it seems cool to study all night long and drink plenty of caffeine.
One professor noted that students from the world’s largest university often have no idea of the basics of caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, set up the course, which, as far as he knows, is unique in the US.
He got the idea to start the course after giving a speech on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end of my speech, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why am I only hearing this now, in my final year?’
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep is, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is being organized for the first time this year, will explain to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance and how they also promote their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to organize the course when it was determined that students during the week had a severe sleep deficit.
The course lasts one hour and includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one of the sections, students see an image of a dormitory, where they click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise devices and books to learn more about the effects of caffeine and light and the way sports performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and the importance of a sleeping routine.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Using a map of the campus, with interactive icons, participants are encouraged to think about their daily routine.
“We know that this will not immediately change the behaviour of the students.
But we think they have the right to know all of this, just as people have the right to know what impacts the choice of cigarettes has on their health, Czeisler added.
The culture of night-studying pride still exists, he says, and due to modern technology and the increasing pressure on students, sleep deprivation is an ever-increasing problem.
Ensuring adequate sleep, of good quality, should be the student’s “secret weapon” to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation causes the brain to give them a constant sense of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from Calfornia who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler prepare the course because he had attended the professor’s class last year when he was in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to make the course available to everyone on campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to follow a similar study program before coming to the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set an alarm for their bedtime, and not just an alarm to get up. They also need to be aware of the harmful effects of the ‘blue light’ of electronics screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm, which can make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks down Gerrard's men
The Rangers saw their outing again disappointing when Dolly Menga scored and Steven Gerrard's weak team defeated 1-0 in Livingston.
The Ibrox team had hoped for a first win in an outing since defeating St Johnstone 4–1 in February, but Gary Holt's team led to the defeat, barely second to Gerrard as manager in 18 games. His team is now eight points behind at Hearts, which continues to top Ladbrokes.
Menga scored seven minutes for the rest, and the Rangers failed to score the equaliser.
The Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston rises to third, with only a difference in number of goals compared to Hibernian.
And the Rangers could get even more trouble, as border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after apparently an object was thrown at him by the visitors' supporters.
Gerrard made eight changes to his team, passing Ayr and going to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt stayed with the same team for Livingston, who managed to sniff a point last week, and he would have been excited about the way his well-trained team managed to block the opponents at every move.
The Rangers may have had the most possessions, but Livingston was more involved.
They had to score after two minutes, when Menga gave up the ball for the first time and Scott Pittman had Allan McGregor's goal in sight, but the midfielder could not finish it.
A deep free staircase from Keaghan Jacobs reached captain Craig Halkett, but his fellow defender Alan Lithgow kicked against the rear pole.
The Rangers did manage to take control, but they seemed to hope for a good finish rather than that they really believed in it if they could approach the goal.
Alfredo Morelos at least felt he was entitled to a penalty when he and Steven Lawless collided after a quarter of a game, but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's request.
The Rangers were only able to shoot twice to the goal in the first half, but Liam Kelly, who was a former goalkeeper at the Ibrox, was able to stop Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's tame shot with ease.
Livingston’s opener in the 34th minute may or may not be in the extension of the overall game course, no one can deny that they deserved this, even if it was just for their hard work.
Again, the Rangers had not grown up against Jacobs' deep playing pattern.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cool-blooded and chose Menga, who easily kicked the ball into the goal.
Gerrard interrupted the Coulibaly/Ryan Kent switch, which had almost immediate consequences when the wing player Morelos passed, but an impressive Kelly raced away from his line to stop the ball.
But Livingston continued to force visitors to play the kind of game that Livingston likes to play, with Lithgow and Halkett continuing to kick long balls.
Holt's team could have increased his lead in the final phase of the game, but McGregor kept up well and blocked Jacobs, after which Lithgow came wide from the corner.
Invader Glenn Middleton of the Rangers asked for a penalty at the end of the game after an attack with Jacobs, but Thomson looked the other way.
Almanak: the inventor of the Geigerteller
And now a page from the almanac of our ‘Sunday Morning’: September 30, 1882, today exactly 136 years ago, for whom can count... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm ‘Hans’ Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the geiger counter.
The geyser counter has since become an icon in pop culture, for example in ‘Bells or Coronado’, a 1950 film featuring the seemingly unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What the hell is that?”
Rogers: ‘That’s a geyser counter, which is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you set up this headphone, you can hear the effect of the atoms released by the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: “It’s really going to blow up now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains relevant.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ malignant cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ and kill malignant cells
Vaccine Teaches Immune System to Recognize Malignant Cells in Treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells in a patient to change them into a lab
They can then ‘see’ a protein that is common in many types of cancer and are then re-injected
A test vaccine delivers promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months
The method removes immune cells from a patient, then adjusts the cells in the lab to ‘see’ the HER2 protein, which is often found in all types of cancer, and then re-injects the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 ‘stimulates the growth of different types of cancer’, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and intestinal cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar way to remove immune cells from patients and ‘learn’ these cells to tackle cancer cells was previously found to work in the treatment of a particular type of leukemia.
Kanye West stands out for pro-Trump tirade and wears MAGA-pet after his appearance on Saturday Night Live.
It didn't go the way he had hoped.
Kanye West was aired during a Saturday Night Live broadcast after an incoherent performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he will be running for president in 2020.
After bringing his third issue of the evening, Ghost Town, with a cap on his head with the text Make America Great Again, he stabbed a tirade against the Democrats and repeated that he supports Trump.
“Often when I talk to a white man, he asks, ‘How can you have sympathy for Trump now? He’s a racist!’
If I was worried about racism, I would have left America for a long time," he said.
Saturday Night Live began with a parody in which Hollywood star Matt Damon stabbed the dragon with the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh in the Senate Judiciary Committee in connection with the alleged assault that Christine Blasey Ford accuses him of.
The West tirade was not broadcast, but comedian Chris Rock uploaded it on social media.
It's not clear if Rock wants to stick the dragon with West with his post.
West also complained to the audience that he had been taken backstage under fire for his cap.
“They’ve kicked me backstage.
They said, ‘Don’t get on the stage with that cap.’
They threatened me!
And then they say I'm apathetic," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, ‘Do you want to see how apathetic you look?’ He said he would wear her superman cape, ‘because that means you can’t command me. Do you want the world to get better?
Give me some love."
From the audience came at least twice shouting and the members of SNL seemed embarrassed, according to Variety. The magazine was told by one present: ‘The whole studio was suddenly silent.’
West was a guest as last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with a performance of the song I Love It while disguised as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted, “To one of our bravest minds: THANK YOU THAT YOU TROTS THE MASS.”
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just “just himself, and that’s beautiful.”
“But I choose not to reward someone who supports and spews out an ideology that harms my community (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’).
He's free to do whatever he wants.
We are too,” she added.
Before the show began, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name. From now on, he is, he says, “the creature formally known as Kanye West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name. He was preceded by Diddy Puff, also known as Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Colleague rapper Snoop Dogg also carried the name Snoop Lion and the late music legend Prince once changed his name to a symbol and then to The Artist formerly known as Prince.
Allegation of attempted murder after stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast police judge on Monday.
The accusation will be investigated by the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington pulls out to toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as swordsman Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor draws on the macho hero’s stereotype and says that young boys often think when they see such roles on screen that they have to be tough to get respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes “something has gone wrong” and wondered how the issue of toxic masculinity should be addressed in the era of #MeToo.
Kit, who is recently married to his co-star of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admitted that he strongly believes the problem needs to be addressed.
"This is really an important question for me personally at the moment: where did it go wrong with our masculinity?" he said.
"What did we teach men when they were growing up, which now confronts us with this problem?"
Kit thinks television may sometimes be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity, due to its very masculine characters.
He said, “What was born and what was taught?”
What is being taught on TV and on the streets that makes young boys think they need to be a certain kind of man?
I think that’s one of the big questions today: how do we change that?
“There’s something wrong with young people.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not act in prequels or sequels of Games of Thrones if the series is over next summer, because he is “ready with battlefields and horses.”
Starting in November, Kit will star in a revival of Sam Shepard’s True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a burglar.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks his meeting with his wife Rose is the most beautiful aftermath of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife during the show, so that’s how I left my future family and life behind,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the great love of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple were married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslies family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reports that the number of Chinese people with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
Health authorities say more than 820,000 people have been affected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the diseases were transmitted through sex, which was not previously the case.
HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China in the past through transfusions of contaminated blood.
But the number of people who get HIV in this way is now almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Compared to the same period last year, however, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been criminalized in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly widespread.
According to studies, 70 to 90% of men who have sex with men would eventually marry a woman because of the conservative values of the country.
Often, the diseases are transmitted by insufficient protection during sexual relations in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medication as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff member leaked data from Republican senators and draws on ‘dangerous lies’ and ‘conspiracy theories’
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters opposes allegations that one of her staff members has placed the personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on the legislators' Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrat claims the allegations are being spread by “extreme right-wing” respondents and websites.
“Lies, lies and even more nasty lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published data included the private address and phone number of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The data appeared online Thursday, posted by a stranger in Capitol Hill during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct to Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate judge at the Supreme Court.
The leak came after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to conservative websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState, the IP address that indicates the source of the posts was linked to Waters’ office and contained information from an employee of Waters, Hill said.
“This unfounded accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie,” Waters said.
“My employee, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these false accusations, was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a blatant lie.”
Waters’s statement was quickly hit with criticism online, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial sounds angry,” Fleischer wrote.
“You can tell from this that she doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of something he did not do, he should not get angry.
He must not be rebellious.
He should not question the prosecutor's motives.
He must remain calm and serene.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters’s reaction to the Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of excessive anger during Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to take Waters' place in the midterm elections, also gave his opinion on Twitter.
“Very good, if it’s true,” he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had informed the relevant services and law enforcement agencies of these false allegations.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are known,” she said, “and that they are held legally liable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to my staff.”
Review: Johnny English Strikes Again – Weak Spy Parody with Rowan Atkinson
In every new film with a British touch, we are now traditionally looking for references to Brexit, and that is indeed applicable to this revival of the Johnny English franchise, the comic action films with a slack spy in the lead role, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and was revived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is this airy self-satire about how bad we are doing it the latest export product for our country?
The incompetent Johnny English with puffy eyes and flexible facial features manages to manage everything in a hundred, even with his second comeback. From his name you can already deduce that he is a general comic character that was conceived for cinematographers in countries where one speaks a language other than English.
He is of course the foolish secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim to smooth glamour, a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr Bean and a twig of that guy who contributed one note to the themed issue of Chariots of Fire during the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
It is originally based on the traveler and the international mysterious man who Atkinson once played in the Barclaycard TV spots (which everyone has forgotten in the meantime) who always leaves a certain chaos behind.
His latest portrait of Johnny English contains one or two beautiful moments.
I loved how Johnny English approached a helicopter in his medieval armor and the rotor blades tapped against his helmet.
Atkinson can clearly show in this film how much talent he has for physical comedy, but the humor comes across rather weak and crazy enough, especially now that the "serious" film series like 007 and Mission Impossible itself include comedy as an ingredient, and do so well.
The humor seems to be intended for children rather than adults, and the hilarious misfortune of Johnny English comes to me less original and focused than the non-text jokes of the character Bean playing Atkinson.
The constant theme now is that Britain is in great difficulty.
A cyberhacker has infiltrated the super-secret spy network on the web, making the identity of all active secret agents of Great Britain known, to the great dismay of the agent in charge, an unfortunately small role of Kevin Eldon.
That's the drop that makes the bucket run over from the prime minister, a pretentious woman with problems at her head and terribly unpopular as a politician. Emma Thompson does her utmost with this character that reminds of Teresa May, but the script doesn't offer much material to work with.
According to her intelligence advisers, she must employ a retired spy, as every active spy is compromised.
And that means the stunning Johnny English himself, who now works as a schoolteacher in a chic institution, but unofficially teaches about undercover work. Here are fun jokes in the story, because English’s espionage lessons are like School of Rock.
English is quickly summoned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former pitiful helper Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man. His wife is the captain of a submarine, a tumultuous and jovial role that lies below Vicki Pepperdine's level.
The Batman and Robin of Her Majesty's Secret Service's disastrous conditions are back in action and meet Olga Kurylenko's bloodthirsty femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls for the charms of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of clumsy doll fun: disguised as waiters, they set fire to an opaque French restaurant, kicking robbery aboard Volta’s luxury yacht, and English unleashes pure anarchy when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta’s house.
For the latter, all the registers are pulled open, but no matter how well-intentioned and turbulent the scene is, it does something resembling children's television.
It's not all very original.
And just like the other Johnny English films, I wonder: can’t the British film industry really come up with a role that honors Rowan Atkinson’s talent?
Labour denies the party is devising a plan in which Britons work four days a week but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical plan in which Britons work four days a week, but get paid for five days.
The party would reportedly like bosses of companies to pass on the savings they make as a result of the Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) revolution to their employees by giving them an extra day off.
For example, employees can enjoy a three-day weekend, but still earn as much.
According to sources, the idea fits into the economic agenda of the party and plans to make the balance of the country tilt in the direction of the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week has already been approved by the Trade Union Alliance, which finds a good way to ensure that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “It is expected that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
“It will not happen from one moment to the next, but a four-day workweek is a goal that fits within the party’s drive to make the balance in the economy more beneficial to the workers and that fits within the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
Labour is not the first party to support such an idea, given the fact that the Green Party has already promised a four-day working week in the 2017 national election campaign.
However, the effort is not yet fully supported by the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not the party's policy intention and is not considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour conference last week to clarify his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from the “faceless drivers” and the “profits” at utility companies.
The Shadow Chancellor’s plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not be able to recover the full value of their share, as a Labour government could apply “discounts” based on perceived misconduct.
He also confirmed that there are plans to include employees on the boards of directors of companies and to set up Inclusive Ownership Funds, which will give 10 percent of the shares of private sector firms to employees who can earn up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week and raises the question of whether the FBI’s findings could cause Republican senators to withdraw their support for the candidate.
In an interview broadcast Sunday at 60 Minutes, Correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could discover anything that could lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said before the hearing that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charge came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, determined, unequivocal.”
Graham’s voice, however, seems to stand on the wall.
"My opinion of Brett Kavanaugh is firm and the accusation should contain dynamite," he said.
"As for Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett has strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one named by her could verify it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don’t see any new developments.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed to reducing poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival is organized in New York, an annual music event where a very impressive line-up of stars will perform and that has an equally impressive mission: the end of poverty in the world.
For the seventh time, tens of thousands of people will come to the Great Lawn in Central Park for the Global Citizen Festival. Not only to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also to generate awareness for the real goal: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was first organized in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international advocates who hope to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
Concert attendees wishing to obtain a free ticket for the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), had to complete a series of tasks, or 'actions', such as volunteering, e-mailing a world leader, conducting a phone call, or otherwise meaningfully generating awareness for the event.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been, with another 12 years to go to achieve this goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a suitable way to convince people to demand a call to action or is this just another form of ‘clickivism’, giving people the feeling that they are making a real contribution by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, according to Global Citizen, more than 19 million ‘actions’ of supporters have been registered, aimed at a large number of different goals.
According to Global Citizen, these actions have contributed to the commitment of world leaders and made policy proposals worth more than $37 billion that must change the lives of 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 initiatives and statements based on the actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or brought together through sponsorship campaigns.
The group estimates that the funds raised so far have impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK investors and executives with the goal of "helping children realize their full potential," has pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global.
“With the help of the UK government, donors, other national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice that is malnutrition a footnote in history,” Tracey Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told the audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that, after sending more than 5,000 actions in which the UK government was asked to improve the nutrition situation for mothers and children, the government has announced a project, the Power of Nutrition, to support that will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the Global Citizens website that asked “why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
The group replied: "It will be a long and difficult road, in which we will sometimes fall and fail.
But, like the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will ultimately be successful because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the artists who will perform this year during the event in New York that is presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States may use the Navy for a 'blockade' to block Russian energy exports - Minister of the Interior
Washington can "if necessary" resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, said Ryan Zinke, the U.S. Secretary of State, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria, where the country acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
“I believe they are only in the Middle East to be able to act on energy, just as they are in Eastern Europe and the southern flank of Europe,” he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to counter this.
"The United States has that ability, with the Navy, to ensure that the shipping routes remain open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy does not come to market," he said.
Zinke spoke to guests at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that portrays itself as the “voice of the energy consumer” in the US.
He went on to compare Washington’s approach to Russia with that of Iran and noted that these are not fundamentally different.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels," he said, referring to Russia as a country that knows only a 'art', with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration is trying to boost the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe and thereby replace Russia, a country that offers by far the cheapest option for European consumers.
For that reason, Trump administration officials, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw its sights from the “unsuitable” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trum of Berlin, has made Moscow’s “prisoner.”
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth $11 billion, which will double the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s strong opposition to the project is driven only by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we agree with the view that energy should not be used to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers themselves," Alexander Novak, the Russian energy minister, said after a meeting with Rick Perry, the US energy minister, in Moscow in September.
The US position provoked a reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
The Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI), the leading industrial organisation in Germany, has called on the US not to interfere with EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third power interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren 'considers seriously' to run for president in 2020, says senator for Massachusetts
Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator, said on Saturday she was “considering seriously” to take part in the presidential election after the midterm elections.
At a local meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she is considering participating in the election.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to restore the damaged government, and this also means a woman in the top position," she said.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider making myself eligible as president."
Warren was running against President Donald Trump at the town hall meeting, saying he was “steering this country in the wrong direction.”
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing in our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been outspoken in her criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Of course we have to wait for an FBI investigation before we vote on this.”
However, an opinion poll published on Thursday found that a majority of Warren’s own supporters believe she should not be eligible for election in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not stand for election, according to an opinion poll by Suffolk University's Political Research Center and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent were willing to vote for her.
The survey showed that there was more support for former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor of a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other names of prominent Democrats linked to a possible 2020 presidential election are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially make a decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin speaks about PTSD from Track Palin during an election meeting of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, has spent a year in Iraq after taking office in September.
He was arrested and charged after a report of domestic violence on Monday night.
“By what my own son is going through, what he’s going through now that he’s back, I have understanding for other families who are experiencing the consequences of PTSD and the injuries that some of our soldiers are returning to,” she told the audience at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other veterans "they come back a little differently, they come back and they have become harder, they come back and they wonder if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and the pilots and all the other soldiers have given for the homeland."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and is charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, interference in a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon under influence, according to Dan Bennett, a police spokesman in Wasilla.
Washington, D.C. and 18 states support protest against new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal protest against a new policy in the U.S. that refuses asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and Washington D.C. last Friday, as a “friend-of-the-court” filed a statement in Washington’s court in support of an asylum seeker who is challenging this policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace vs. Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and his violent sons who are members of a gang" abused her but that U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She is incarcerated in Texas.
The lawyers of the states that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of people are coming to seek asylum in the U.S., as countries that have major problems in the field of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy has reversed a 2014 Board of Immigrant Appeals decision that made it possible for undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, the attorney general of Washington, D.C., said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application and such an impediment is contrary to that principle,” the court said in a statement.
The lawyers further argue that the policy of denying immigrants access to the U.S. hurts the U.S. economy, as these immigrants are likely to become new entrepreneurs and the country "provided with the necessary labor."
In June, Justice Minister Jeff Sessions ordered judges not to grant asylum to victims of domestic and gang-related violence.
“Asylum is available to those fleeing their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in its June 11 announcement of the policy.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems, even if these problems are serious, which people face every day, anywhere in the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
"It feels very tense," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she tried to comfort her feverish baby in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute new bodies arrive in ambulances.
And clean water is scarce".
Residents returned to their devastated homes and searched their wet possessions for valuables that they could still use.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals are overcrowded, as long as they have not been damaged by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris who suffered a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the army hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside because of the risk of severe aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he recounted his feelings as the devastating earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed against the remains of a wall," Haris told an Associated Press correspondent, adding that he and his family were in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife cry for help, and later I heard nothing.
I don't know what happened to her and our child.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Intimidation’ with ‘Propaganda Ads’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page ad in an American newspaper praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump recently referred to China Daily’s paid appendix in the Des Moines Register, Iowa’s best-selling newspaper, after he accused China of meddling in the November 6 U.S. congressional election, an allegation denied by China.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked, according to U.S. officials quoted by Reuters, a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war, in which they have imposed increasingly higher import tariffs on each other.
China’s retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were specifically aimed at targeting exporters in states like Iowa, who support Trump’s Republican Party, as Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and formerly longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said China had hit U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
“China,” as Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “is now doubling the intimidation by publishing propaganda ads in our free press.”
“By spreading this propaganda, the government of China is using freedom of speech and a free press, a long-cherished tradition in America by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
In contrast, at a kiosk in the center of Beijing, you will find in vain diverging voices and you will not see a true reflection of the divergent opinions that the Chinese people may have about the arduous economic trajectory, because the media is firmly under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers has refused to publish his article," if he did not say which newspaper it was.
The Kavanaugh debacle has alienated Republicans from female voters just before the midterm elections, analysts warn
Now that many prominent Republicans are rallying around Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court, and defending him against various accusations of sexual violence, analysts warn that they will experience a setback, particularly among women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions around this subject have been enormous and most Republicans have already indicated that they want to continue with the vote.
"These things can't be turned back," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill for an article that appeared Saturday.
Reeher said he wondered if Senator Jeff Flake (Republican, Arizona)’s attempt to plead for an FBI investigation at the last minute would be enough to satisfy the angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday, they haven’t forgotten it tomorrow and they haven’t forgotten it in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, demonstrators shouted “November is coming!” during their demonstration in the Senate Hall while Republicans who controlled the Justice Committee chose to approve Kavanaugh’s candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation for the Democrats will reach a record high," Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, told the news site.
“People say it’s already high, and that’s true.
But it can go even further, especially among floating female voters in the suburbs and among younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who often do not vote even if they do not agree with the president.
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which she further explained her accusation of sexual intimidation against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested that a setback could follow if the Republicans pressed the nomination.
"This has become a messy mess for the Republican Party," Michael Steele, former party chairman of the Republican Party, said earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote in the committee, or the final vote or Kavanaugh taking to court, but it's also about the way the Republicans handled this and how they treated her," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats get elected, said in a statement.
The Americans, however, appear to be divided over the question of who they believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority opposing the latter.
A new YouGov opinion poll shows that 41 percent of respondents are certain or likely to believe Ford’s testimony and 35 percent are certain or likely to believe Kavanaugh.
Additionally, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh certainly or probably lied during his testimony while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
Following Flake’s intent, the FBI is currently investigating the charges against Ford and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh assaulted her under the influence of alcohol when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her his genitals during a party during the time they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans a new internet to tackle Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of the technology legend, is a company based on the open source platform Solid by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that "world domination" is the leading thought behind Inrupt.
"We have to do this now," he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology to enable people to create their own ‘personal online data storage’ or POD.
It can store lists of contacts, activity lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available together via one browser and all at the same time.
What makes POD unique is the fact that it completely depends on the user who has access to what information.
The company calls this “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea behind Inrupt is, according to CEO John Bruce, that the company provides the resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team will not hold talks with “Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete transformation that puts all their business models fully on their heads at once.”
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "the mission (of Inrupt) is to deliver the commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new web, which is built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
After the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain as founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: clergyman and wearer of the Victoria Cross from WO I honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England who acquired a Victoria Cross during World War I as a soldier is honored 100 years later in his birthplace.
Lieutenant-Colonel, the Reverend Bernard Vann received the award following the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and thus never knew that he had received the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandsons during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the fact for which his grandfather was distinguished.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal on 29 September 1918 "in a very dense fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns".
He later stormed through the line of fire and led the line forward before running alone to a field gun and knocking out three members of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never touch, but also something that makes me feel humble".
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade that was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "felt very honoured to be allowed to play a role in the parade" and added that "the bravery of a real hero is evidenced by the support he receives from a large number of people".
MMA fans stayed up all night to see Bellator 206 and got Peppa Pig instead
Imagine, you stayed up all night to watch a fully dusted Bellator 206 and you don’t get to see the most important moment.
The San Jose plaque contained 13 fights, including six in the main section, and this was broadcast throughout the night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, viewers in the UK were unpleasantly surprised when the transmitter switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were indignant because they had stayed up all night, especially before this fight.
A fan described the transition to the children's program on Twitter as "a bad joke".
“According to government regulations, no content that is not suitable for children should be shown after 6:00 a.m., and that’s why we had to switch to the children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa's the pig," yessssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they will be adjusting their programming to ensure viewers in the UK will also get a chance in the future.
“I think, in terms of the rematch, we can solve this problem,” Coker said.
“But it’s six o’clock in the morning here on a Sunday and we can’t discuss anything until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
We're working on it.
When I made the switch, a lot of text messages went back and forth and believe me, these weren’t all as friendly.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But that was not the case, it was a government problem.
I can promise that this will not happen a second time.
We limited the broadcasts to five nights instead of six, as we normally did, we tried to make it even better for the fans, but we just went too far.
It is an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels 'Inferior' Due to His Sexual Disposition
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley says he felt inferior during his youth because of his sexual orientation, but that this gave him the motivation to become successful.
The twenty-four-year-old said that until he went to secondary school, he did not realize that "not everyone is like me."
In an interview with Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 with Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken out about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that parenting had contributed to the fact that he attached less value to winning at the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of the long-running show, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Appearing as a shift on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less" than others during his youth because it was "socially not accepted to like both girls and boys."
He said, “To this day, those feelings, the feeling of being less and the feeling of being different, are really existing facts that have given me the strength to be successful.”
He wanted to prove that he was “someone” so that he wouldn’t disappoint people if they eventually found out his orientation.
The winner of two bronze Olympic medals has become a notable campaigner for the LGBT community and used his presence at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt happy that he could live openly without further consequences and that he wanted to "give hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said that the fact that he fell in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Back, whom he met in 2013, "completely surprised me."
Daley was married last year to the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you have to endure so much at such a young age,” he took part in his first Olympic Games at the age of fourteen and his father died three years later of cancer, it’s hard to find someone in your own age group who has experienced the same highs and lows.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
“If you had asked me this question last year, I would have answered that it was all about winning a gold medal,” he said.
“But you know what, there are more important things on earth than winning gold Olympic medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son has the same name as his father who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted that he would die and one of the last things he had asked was if they had already received the tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t get it over my heart to say, you won’t be there to sit in the front row, Dad,” he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and not until his breathing actually stopped and he died, I could finally admit that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I knew I'd been dreaming about this my whole life. Diving for a home audience during the Olympics, there's no better feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first music choice, Proud by Heather Small, that had gripped him strongly on his way to the games and from which he still got chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs can be heard on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, not in shape, on the bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will set a record Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he has to find his shape back so as not to make it a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who is participating in the biennial event for the 12th time, a record, was placed on the bench by team captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has often done for the United States, the winner of five majors divides the day between supporting his teammates and practicing on the driving range, in an attempt to figure out what it’s up to.
Because even at the peak of his career he was never known for his straight drives, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the narrow fairways of Le Golf National, where the long grass of the roughs-drifting balls routinely punishes.
And if the track itself is not yet daunting enough, in the ninth game on Sunday, the always accurate Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, will face newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who are four points behind at the start of the 12 singles matches start well, Mickelson’s match can be absolutely crucial.
Furyk has shown confidence in this man, even though he could have been difficult to tell honestly otherwise.
“He fully understood the role he had today, kicked me in the back, slapped his arm around me and said he’s ready for it tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He has been inducted into the Hall of Fame and has contributed so much to these teams, in the past, but also this week.
I probably didn’t expect him to play just two games.
I expected more, but it's the way it is and it's the way we think we should act.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson can improve Nick Faldo's record for the highest number of Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It could also mean the end of a Ryder Cup career in which he has never quite matched the highlights of his personal career.
Mickelson has 18 won matches, 20 lost matches and 7 equal games in his name, but Furyk said his presence had an indelible influence on the team.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s caught, he likes to make jokes with people and he’s a great guy to have on the team,” he said.
"I think the younger players liked to fool him from time to time last week, which was funny to see.
He has so much more to offer than just his game.”
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows that great advantage can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the comfortable lead ahead of the singles on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a less comfortable situation.
The Dane made his debut in the game at Valderrama in 1997, where the team with captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but eventually passed the finish line with the smallest margin possible: 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just," said Bjorn, here, after seeing the 2018 illumination win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday's National on a 10.
So history shows me and everyone else in the team that this is not a game played yet.
Everyone will have to make a full commitment tomorrow.
Get to work and execute the plan correctly.
It's not over until the points are on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to win this trophy, and that is what we need to keep focusing on.
I keep saying, I focus on the 12 players we can have, but we’re also aware of the people on the other side, some of the best players in the world.”
Delighted with the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never be ahead of the pack in this area.
Tomorrow will be another challenge.
Tomorrow the individual performances will be discussed, and that is another very different discipline.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you’re alone, your golfing skills are really tested.
That’s the message you have to tell the players, try to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
So let your partner go now and he has to get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, expects his players to perform individually better than as partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who won three of the four points.
Furyk himself has experience with both sides of this kind of reversal on the last day, as a member of the winning team in Brookline and as a loser when Europe realized the 'Miracle of Medinah'.
“I remember every damn word of that speech,” he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had cheered his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important matches for tomorrow, but let's try to start well, like in Brookline, or like in Medinah.
When we have the momentum, there will be a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We’ve tuned our line-up to this and we’re sending the men on their way in the order that we think is best and, you know, we’re going to try to get something out of the high hat tomorrow.”
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the counteroffensive and put Rory McIlroy in for the first match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the first half of the lineup.
“I chose this group in this order because I think we’re covered so constantly,” Bjorn said of his selection of singles players.
Germany's new warship postponed
The latest frigate from the German Navy should have come into service in 2014, replacing the outdated Cold War-era warships, but it will take at least a year before it is ready, due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the 'Rheinland-Pfalz', the leading ship in the brand new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoting a military spokesman.
The vessel should have been part of the navy in 2014, but the disturbing problems after delivery have plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Württemberg-class ordered by the navy in 2007 are intended to replace the outdated frigates of the Bremen-class.
As far as we know, they have a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and a form of stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared, and acoustic characteristics.
Other important features are longer maintenance cycles, it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years in a row, far away from home ports.
However, the ongoing delays mean that the advanced warships, which are intended to enable Germany to project its power overseas, are already outdated by the time they are put into operation, Die Zeit notes.
The fateful frigate F125 took the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons behind this return, but German media cited a number of crucial “software and hardware defects” that would render the warship useless if it were to be deployed in a combat mission.
Software defects were especially important because the vessels of the Baden-Württemberg-class are operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, half the manpower on the frigates of the older Bremen-class.
It also became clear that the ship suffers from severe overweight, which will reduce performance and limit the Navy's ability to carry out further upgrades.
The Rhineland-Palatinate weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice as much as ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price tag for the entire project, including the training of the crew, also becomes a problem.
This is said to have reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion, compared to the original <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems that the latest frigates have in their grip are becoming extra important due to the recent warnings that the power of the German navy is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the parliamentary defence committee in Germany, acknowledged that the navy actually "has a shortage of usable ships".
The official said the problem over time has grown like a snowball because old ships were taken out of service but no replacement vessels were delivered.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class had yet been available to be included in the navy.
The National Trust is listening to the secret life of bats
New research conducted on a farm in the Scottish Highlands is trying to reveal how bats use the landscape in their quest for food.
The hope is that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will contribute to future conservation activities.
The study, which is being conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, follows the common and small dwarf bat, the brown large-breasted bat, and the water bat at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed at key locations around the estate to monitor the activities of bats throughout the season.
Employees of the NTS and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bat's cries and what kind of thing does.
A map of the habitat and a report are then produced to create a detailed landscape-scale image of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation adviser at the NTS, hopes the results will show which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as making pastures and how we can best maintain forests for bats and similar species.
Measles populations in Scotland and the rest of the UK have declined significantly in the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect sleeping places and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, just like flycatchers and certain chemical treatments of building materials and attacks by house cats.
Butterflies are not really blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use an advanced echo location technique to determine the position of insects and obstacles in their flight path.
At the NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, bats are taken very seriously.
The NTS has ten trained experts, who regularly examine, inspect dormitories and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organisation has even set up the first and only bat reserve in Scotland at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of Scotland’s ten bat species live.
Landscape manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal territory for bats.
“Here in Threave we have a great environment for bats,” he said.
"We have the old buildings, many very old trees and the right habitat.
But so much is not yet known about bats, and that’s why the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
He stresses the importance of controlling bats before maintenance is carried out, as the possible unconscious destruction of a dormant area can lead to the death of 400 female bats and their young, potentially eradicating a full local population.
Flea mice are a protected species and it is illegal to kill them, harass or disturb them or to destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official for the Bat Conservation Trust, has asked the public to make a contribution to help.
She said, “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and from many of our species we simply don’t know how it’s going with their populations.”
Ronaldo Rejects Charges of Assault as His Lawyers Prepare to Prosecute a German Magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called allegations of assault “fake news” and said people “want to promote themselves” by using his name.
His lawyers are about to press charges against the German weekly Der Spiegel, in which the allegations have been published.
The head of Portugal and Juventus is accused of assaulting an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is also accused of paying her $375,000 to remain silent about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Via a video for his 142 million followers on Instagram Live, Ronaldo, 33, a few hours after the allegations were reported, called the reports “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today, fake news," the winner of five Golden Balls said on camera.
“They want to promote themselves by calling my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by calling my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man, and by and by good," the footballer added, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit seeking to prosecute Der Spiegel for the charges they called “an unacceptable reporting of suspicions in the field of privacy,” according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, a lawyer, said the footballer wants compensation for the "moral damage for an amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident allegedly took place in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the footballer’s room, where he allegedly raped her anal, as read in the indictment filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and that he told her that he was a "good guy" for "99 percent", but that he is sometimes left behind that "one percent".
The documents state that Ronaldo confirms that the couple had sex, but that this was mutually agreeable.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that photographs were taken of her injuries in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "afraid of the consequences" and because she was concerned about the "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old now says she wants to invalidate the scheme because she is permanently traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged assault and left this summer for Italian giant Juventus in a deal worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: UK ‘will be forever sorry’ as carmakers leave
The UK "will be forever sorry" if it loses its status as a world leader in car production after Brexit, said Greg Clark, the minister of economic affairs.
He added that it was "careful" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily halt production at the plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delays at the border in the event of a “no-deal Brexit” would cost jobs.
The factory in Burnaston, where Toyota’s Auris and Avensis are made, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other countries in the European Union.
“My vision is that if Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of March, we will see production in our factory stall,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director at Burnaston.
Other car products in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also voiced their fears about the consequences of leaving the EU without an agreement for the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has already announced that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Most car manufacturers are concerned about risks in the supply chain in the event of a “no-deal Brexit”.
Toyota’s production line runs on the ‘just-in-time’ principle, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be unrest at the borders that the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota cannot store more than one day of stock at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production would be shut down.
Clark said Theresa May’s Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU was “exactly tuned to avoid those border checks.”
"We need to have a deal. We want to have the best deal, which will not only allow us to continue the current success, but also to take this opportunity," he told the listeners of the Today program of BBC Radio 4'.
“The proof, not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, is that we absolutely need to be able to continue with this very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but warned in the longer term that the additional costs would affect the company’s competitive position and that this would ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a representative of the trade union Unite at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once these jobs are lost, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump-Rosenstein meeting could be delayed again, says White House
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “deferred another week” as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian influence of the election, links between Trump’s assistants and Russia, and possible impediments to the president’s legal process.
The question of whether Trump is going to fire the deputy attorney general and thereby endanger Mueller’s independence has kept the Washington gossip machine running for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of carrying a microphone to record conversations with Trump and to depose the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But when he went to the White House last Monday, rumors circulated that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he “didn’t want to dismiss Rosenstein any more,” but then the meeting was moved to avoid a conflict with a Senate Justice Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, would both get caught.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, delaying the vote in the entire Senate.
On Sunday, Sarah Sanders, Trump’s press chief, appeared on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “No date has been set yet, it could be this week, but it could also be postponed another week, given all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I always want to keep the press informed.”
Some reporters had difficulty with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the shortage of press conferences was not caused by a dislike of the "attentive" TV journalists, though, she added: "I will not deny that they are trying to attract attention."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president does more question-and-answer sessions than any president does for him," she said, without providing any evidence, "we've looked at the numbers."
Press conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but “if the press has the chance to ask the president of the United States directly, that’s infinitely better than talking to me.
We’re trying to do that a lot and you’ve seen us do that often in the last few weeks and that will take the place of a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends public sessions or during press conferences with dignitaries visiting.
Press conferences with only the president are rare.
In New York this week, the president possibly demonstrated why, he made an open-hearted and at times bizarre appearance to the assembled reporters.
Minister of Health writes a letter on Brexit to NHS Scotland employees from other EU countries
The Minister of Health has written a letter to EU staff working in the NHS Scotland to express the country’s gratitude and desire to continue working at the NHS after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter with less than six months to go before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already declared its readiness to bear the costs of applying for permanent status for EU citizens working for decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued, and this autumn the expected decisions will be taken.
But at the same time, the UK government has also tightened up preparations for a possible scenario in which no deal is reached.
I know these uncertain times must be for all of you.
That is why I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the NHS and provide benefits for the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency operation after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency operation yesterday after suffering a head injury in the 31-27 losing game against the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of the Tennessee.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the accident occurred shortly before rest.
“He came to the sideline and fell down there more or less,” Reed said.
The trainers and medical staff immediately gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline, before putting him on a stretcher and taking him for further research.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of the operating room at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details about the type/size of the injury are yet known," and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season at Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He was tackled a total of five times on Saturday before leaving the field, making him a total of 18 tackles this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher rents when they buy a house in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher rents when they buy a house in the UK and the proceeds are used to help the homeless according to new Conservative plans
This action will have to neutralize the success of Corbyn to attract young voters
The increase in taxes is levied on persons who do not pay tax in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects this to bring in <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year, to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher rents when they buy a house in the UK and the extra revenue is used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s success that attracts young voters with promises to provide more affordable homes and tell this to multi-dealers.
The tax increase is levied on individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, putting the extra income into an effort by the government to combat homelessness.
The surcharge, which comes on top of the current vacancies, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and homes purchased for rent, can go up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year in this way.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the new construction in London is purchased by people who do not live in the UK. This drives up prices and makes it difficult for starters to get a foot on the home ladder.
Many prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become practically 'ghost cities' due to the high number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson had advocated for a reduction in the empty space to help young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction firms of keeping prices high by buying up land and not using it, and he called on May to abolish quotas on affordable homes to repair the "housing disgrace" in Britain.
Corbyn has announced a striking series of housing reforms, including rent ceilings and an end to “no negligence” expulsion.
He also wants to give local governments more opportunities to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said I wanted to spend my time as prime minister on restoring the ‘British Dream’, that life is getting better for every new generation.
And that means that our flawed housing market needs to be repaired.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it may not be as easy for people who do not live in the UK, and for foreign companies, to buy houses here as it is for hard-working British residents.
For too many people the dream of ever owning a house has become too vague a dream and the humiliation of life without a roof over your head is too real.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland"
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, says it is his “ultimate ambition” to ever become Scotland’s manager.
De Schot, 42, enjoys the challenge of reviving the club from northeast England, currently third in League One, three points from first place.
He went to the Stadium of Light last summer after bringing St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“As a footballer, I wanted to play for my country.
But I was selected for the B-team and that was the end of the tie," Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
“When I was a kid, I saw my father and I often play in Hampden Park and it’s something that keeps attracting me.
However, that possibility would only come if I was successful in managing a club."
Ross' predecessors as managers of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic says he was not intimidated to become the successor of these established names at a major club, earlier he had refused advances from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me is currently measured by 'can I let this club return to the Premier League?'
Due to the structure and facilities of this club, it is undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task to achieve this, but I can only see myself as successful if I bring the club back there.”
Ross is only three years into his career as a manager, after a period as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months in the coaching group of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from degradation to the third division and transformed St Mirren from on the verge of degradation to winning the Championship in the following season.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than he ever did during his career as a footballer at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably really a crossroads," he recalled from the moment he took over the lead at Alloa.
"I really believed that management was the right choice for me, much more than playing.
It sounds bizarre, because I did the best I could, I deserved pretty well and I knew a few reasonable highlights.
But football can be hard.
There are a lot of things that you face every week.
I still have that, given the stress and pressure of the profession, but management just feels good.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager and now that I’m real, I’m as good at it as I’ve ever felt in my adult life.”

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on a Saturday, research reveals
The heatwave in the summer has boosted revenues from British pubs struggling to survive, but has also put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups with pubs and bars saw sales increase by 2.7 percent in July, but revenues in restaurants were 4.8 percent lower, the figures show.
Peter Martin, of the CGA business consultancy that collected the figures, said: "Permanent sunshine and the fact that England took longer than expected to participate in the World Championships meant that July showed a similar pattern as June, when the pubs had achieved 2.8 percent more turnover, with the difference that the restaurants were still getting the most out of it.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant sales in June only got worse in July.
Pubs and bars focused on liquor sales performed by far the best, with better LFL growth (like-for-like) than that of restaurants went down.
Pubs that also sell food are aimed at members of the sun too, but not as dramatic as the restaurants.
It seems that people just went out to drink.
In managed pubs and bars, drinking revenue was 6.6 percent higher for the month, while food revenue was 3 percent lower.
Paul Newman of RSM, analyst for the leisure and hospitality industry, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important social or sporting events remain the main factors for turnover in the entertainment market.
It is therefore not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a drop in turnover of 4.8 percent year-on-year is particularly painful given the ongoing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the operators who focus on food and only time will learn whether the more temperate temperatures of August can give the much-needed pause."
Total revenue growth in the pub and restaurant industry, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the decline from the introduction of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the revenue monitor for the pub, bar and restaurant sectors in the UK, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operational groups, with a combined revenue of <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion. This is the industry’s established benchmark.
One in five children have a secret social media account, which they keep hidden from their parents
One in five children, some under the age of 11, have a secret social media account, which they keep hidden from parents and teachers, a survey reveals.
Survey of 20,000 High School Students Revealed Growth in 'Fake Insta Pages'
This news has intensified the fear that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of students say they have a “main account” that they also show their parents
One in five children, some under the age of 11, create social media accounts that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in fake Insta accounts, a reference to Instagram, the photo-sharing site.
This news has intensified the fear that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students say they use a clean “main account” that they show to their parents, while they also have personal accounts.
A mother who accidentally landed on the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenager who asked others to "rape" her.
The study, conducted by independent schools’ Digital Awareness UK and HMC (Headmasters and Headmistresses) Conference, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles and that half admitted to keeping personal accounts on track.
Mike Buchanan, head of HCM, said: “It’s disturbing that so many teens are tempted to create online spaces where they’re not found by their parents and teachers.”
Eilidh Doyle becomes the 'voice of the athlete' in the Scottish Council for Athletics
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Council of the Scottish Athletics World, as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland on the track and in the field and President Ian Beattie described her election as a great opportunity for the sport’s drivers to learn from her extensive experience at an international level over the past ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys a lot of respect in the athletics community of Scotland, the UK and the world and we are confident that the athletics community in Scotland will greatly benefit from her election to the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am delighted to be able to serve as a voice for the athletes and I hope I can make a contribution and help manage the sport in Scotland."
The American who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, two of his four gold Olympic medals, and who now regularly commented on the BBC, could no longer walk after a TIA.
He tweeted: "Today a month ago I had a TIA.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors told me that only time will learn whether I will recover and to what extent.
It’s been terribly hard work, but I’m now fully recovered, I’ve learned to walk again and do my flexibility exercises again today!
Thank you for all your support!"
Ad for breast pump in which mothers are compared with cows, distributes online opinion
A company that makes breast pumps has shared the online opinion with an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers to cows being milked.
To mark the introduction of what’s called “the world’s quietest portable breast pump,” Elvie, a consumer technology producer, has released an ironic, music video-inspired ad to illustrate the freedom this new pump has to offer to pumping mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn on a song that contains lyrics like, 'Yes, I'm milking myself, but you can't see anything' and 'In case you didn't notice, these aren't onions, these are my breasts'.
“Pumps, pumps, pumps, I feed the babies, pumps, pumps, I milk the lady’s.”
However, the ad, which was published on the company’s Facebook page, immediately caused an online controversy.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times and has evoked hundreds of comments, especially mixed reactions from viewers, in which many people say that it treats the "horror" of the dairy industry.
"A bad choice to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they should be expected to give birth to produce milk, but in their case, the babies are taken away within a few days of giving birth."
The Elvie breast pump fits discreetly in a feeding bra (Elvie/Mother).
Someone else noted: "This is of course traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why don’t we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?”
Someone else added: "This ad is so far from reality."
Others defended the ad and one woman admitted that she found the song 'hilarious'.
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I would buy one if I were still breastfeeding.
That pumping gave me the feeling of being a cow.
The ad is a little weird, but I haven’t looked for it too much.
“This is a great product,” someone wrote.
Someone else had the following remark: "This is a funny ad, aimed at moms who are flapping (often at work or in a toilet) and then feel like 'cows'.
This advertisement is not at all positive or negative about the dairy industry."
At the end of the video you will see the group of women all dancing with the pump discreetly hidden in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the understanding that many women who plough sometimes feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or hoses and fits discreetly into a feeding bra, so women have the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while they are on pistons.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, said: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a tough and provocative introduction.
By making a comparison between pumping mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to put the piston and the associated challenges in the spotlight and at the same time show in a entertaining and understandable way how the new pump will provide an incredible sense of freedom.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has taken the front page.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk of Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children silently moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has reached a peak, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by the Trump administration make it harder to accommodate children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants and are afraid to jeopardize their own chances of staying in the country by signing up for a child.
That risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to submit their fingerprints and that this data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, testified before Congress that his organization has arrested dozens of people who have registered as sponsors of unaccompanied minors.
The organization later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had no prior criminal record.
“Almost 80 percent of the people who are sponsors or relatives of the sponsors are illegal in this country and a large part of them are criminal aliens.
We are pursuing these people," Mr. Albence said.
In an attempt to process the children faster, officials have introduced new rules, requiring some of them to appear before the court within one month of the start of detention, rather than within 60 days, which was previously the standard, according to the shelter staff.
Many of them will stand before the court via a video conference, rather than in person, to advocate their application for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed not to be eligible for aid will be deported quickly.
The longer the children remain in detention, the greater the chance they will become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, according to the shelter staff and according to reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns are stronger at a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is struggling are more often ignored, due to the size of the camp.
They added that moving the children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare for this emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can contribute to the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria orders U.S., French and Turkish ‘occupation forces’ to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Muallem also called on Syrian refugees to return, even as the war in the country is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said the foreign troops are illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that "this will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the Assembly.
According to Moualem, the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions more have been rooted and driven out of their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "this holy battle until we have liberated all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and from a "possible illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish troops and Syrian Arabs fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem said the conditions are favorable for their return and accused "some Western countries of spreading irrational fears" leaving most refugees away.
"We have appealed to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return," he said.
“They are politicizing a case that should only be a humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be available for Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major stronghold of the rebels, has created the opportunity to start political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey has averted a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian troops on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that this agreement has "clear deadlines" and said he hoped the military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who "will be wiped out."
Staffan de Mistura, the UN representative, hopes to convene the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition to draft a constitution for post-war Syria and pave the way for elections soon.
Moualem made clear what the Syrian government’s conditions are to participate in the commission and said the panel’s work should be limited to “revising the articles of the current constitution” and he warned against outside interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump would win the 2020 election unless, as many “liberal” viewers are likely to hope, his presidency is prematurely terminated by a ouster procedure and scandals.
In what would undoubtedly be 'the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever'.
At the moment, however, there are no signs of eye fatigue.
Since 2014, prime-time viewership at CNN has more than doubled to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during prime-time, compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show is at the top of ratings for cable programs with 3.5 million viewers on nights of major news.
“This is a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, the head of the ABC drama Designated Survivor, a series about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston for the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said then, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" Scovell told me.
There is entertainment in the chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else on TV, the storylines that come from Washington can influence or determine the future of Roe v. Wade whether immigrant families can reunite or affect the status of the world economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it’s going to implicate beyond being a well-informed citizen of Daniel, when you notice that you’ve been watching a panel of experts for six hours discussing the use of sources from the ‘deep background’ by Bob Woodward in his book ‘Fear’, who’s talking about the color of Paul Manafort’s jack of the Postman’s clothing that has cost you $15,000.
I will never be able to watch Super Mario the same way again.
"What he's doing to give you the idea that it's a reality show is partly that he's giving you something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of 'Pawn Stars', about the rotating cast of the Trump show and the daily plot changes (fighting with the N.F.F.
You can't afford to miss an episode or you have the idea that you're running behind.
When I reached Fleiss earlier this week, it was sunny and 26 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not get off the screen, with Brett Kavanaugh appearing for the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
“I remember doing all those weird shows not so long ago, and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but now it turns out they were right."

Money from outside flows into the most exciting midterm elections for the House of Representatives
It’s not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th district sees an influx of money, thanks to a reshuffle of a constituency that requires two sitting people’s representatives to fight for the same seat.
Pittsburg’s newly re-divided district meets Democratic People’s Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb must face another sitting popular representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which has a lot of overlap with the new 17th district.
The maps were redistributed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally classified ('gerrymandering') in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has led to a clash in the field of campaign finance between the financial arms of the two major parties, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a well-regarded special election for Pennsylvania's 18th constituency.
This seat was occupied by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump had conquered this district by 20 percentage points difference.
According to political experts, the Democrats have a small advantage.
U.S. Considers Punishing El Salvador for Supporting China and Refuses
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing and received little negative response from Washington.
Trump had a cordial meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he owned a hotel in Panama until his partners put out the management team of the Trump Organization.
U.S. State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan," U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But only penalties were considered in the case of El Salvador, because the country received $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, for control of narcotics, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including reductions in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with high unemployment and high murder rates.
As the internal meetings continued, North American and Central American officials held a high-level conference that would focus on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from leaving the United States.
But in mid-September, some top government officials said they wanted the conference to continue, making any possible punitive action against El Salvador impossible in the first place.
The plan now is for Vice President Mike Pence to give a speech at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the government attaches to the meeting, diplomats say.
And the three U.S. envoys have returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further lifting, with no hard messages about Washington’s punitive measures.
A White House spokesman on behalf of Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal discussion on condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is also close to the government and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Study the history
The next step could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible retaliation to justice, for which heavy evidence has now become public.
Mueller is also likely to focus his research on collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia in an attack by Russia on our election.
If Congress changes color, Trump must hold himself accountable for that institution, just as he prepares to turn himself back to the electorate, and perhaps he must go and hold himself accountable for a jury in a court of law.
That’s a lot of mitsen, and I don’t want to suggest that the fall of Trump is inevitable, nor those of his counterparts in Europe.
Choices will have to be made by all of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, who will determine how long the battle will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, but only if the West had offered resistance and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to prevent the years of bloodshed that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and the unrelenting progress of democracy is accelerated or slowed down.
Americans are currently facing several of these types of bending points.
What will we do if Trump sacks Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since the time this magazine reported that he had suggested last year to secretly record talks with the president and that he had speculated on the president’s suitability for office.
Rosenstein says the Times report isn't right.
“How will we respond if the newly requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or not fair, or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of assault and unfair testimony?
And above all, will we be voting in the midterm elections for a Congress that Trump will hold accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy is waiting for a very long winter.
But I believe that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial residence.
She survived it, immigrated to America and sent me, 60 years later, away to light candles for the Sabbath on that table on which a swastika is depicted.
With that as my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans of Glasgow Rangers is optimistic about the match against Rapid Wien
Rangers will visit Rapid Wien on Thursday and know that a victory over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, puts them in a strong position to qualify in Group G of the Europa League.
Due to a knee injury, midfielder Graham Dorrans could not play his first game of the season until the 2-2 draw at Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for better results.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal really has a good team," the 31-year-old said.
"We went into the game with the idea that there was something to win and came out with a point.
Maybe we could have even won at the end, but seen throughout the game, a fair game is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half but when we came out in the second half we were the better team.
Next Thursday is a new big European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it’s going to be a difficult game because they also had a good result in their last game, but if the public is behind us, I’m sure we can push through and we can get a positive result.
“Last year has certainly been heavy, from everything that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a feelgood factor on the club.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it. The training is good.
Hopefully we can push through now, leave the last season behind and be successful again.”
Women Can't Sleep Because of Fear of Retirement
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of the way they wanted to receive care, few people discuss this with their family members.
About half of the respondents to the Nationwide survey said they were talking to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
And only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take the steps necessary to conduct this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
This is where we start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide care if you don’t communicate your wishes well in time.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Take a financial advisor in hand: Your advisor can also give you advice on how to pay for these expenses.
Your financing choices for long-term care can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenses, or deploying your own assets as insurance as long as you have money.
Set up your legal documents: Avoid legal disputes when the insurance needs to be used.
Provide a health care proxy so that you can designate a trusted person who can oversee your medical care and ensure that the professionals adhere to your wishes in case you can no longer communicate.
Also consider a power of attorney for your financial affairs.
In that case, you select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that the invoices are paid if you can no longer do so yourself.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly father or mother has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
In that case, can you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Record these details in a written plan so that you have the information at your fingertips.
“It’s not just the financial matters that matter, but who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What medications are being used?
Who takes care of the dog?
Make sure that plan comes through.”
Man shot multiple times in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air-pressure gun when he walked home after a night out.
The victim, forty plus, was in the Oxford Grove neighborhood of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was hit in his chest, abdomen and hand.
Officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a "random act".
The victim did not see who attacked him.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police have called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise further.
Because the means of communication have been disabled, the official authorities have not yet received information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the Central Celebes province and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th birthday when the tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency that stretches over 300 km along the northwest coast of Celebes.
The Regency, an administrative region just under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main activities in the economy of the Central Celebes province, especially in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mostly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been regularly hit by tsunamis over the past hundred years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami claimed more than 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck in the west of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here is a list of some of the worst earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Atjeh in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and claimed a total of 226,000 lives along the coasts of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Atjeh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes occurred on the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.8 on the Richter scale occurred south of Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, and caused a tsunami that hit the south coast and claimed nearly 700 lives.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 on the Richter scale hit the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale hit one of the Mentawai Islands off the coast of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of more than 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and claimed around 300 lives.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the Pidie regency in Atjeh and caused destruction and panic as people were reminded of the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Several earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska and candidate for the vice presidency, has been arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and offering opposition during the trial, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone from her.
Palin is being held in the Mat-Su house of custody with a $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He appeared before the court on Saturday and declared himself "innocent, sure to know" when asked to do so, the network reported.
Palin is charged with three Class A offences, which means he can be sentenced to one year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B offence, which is punishable by a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of abusing his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, then called the police to report the alleged abuse.
This case is now before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic abuse, interference with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon under influence in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he had punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by a veteran group after she linked her son’s violent behavior to PTSD, which he allegedly left for his time in Iraq.
Indonesia, earthquake, tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale has led to a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been shut down while the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just outside the centre of Celebes, which lies northeast of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
There are videos circulating on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Demand Rare Death Penalty for Suspect of Terrorist Attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York demand the death penalty for Sajfoello Sajpov, the suspect in the terror attack in New York City, in which eight people were killed, a rare punishment that has not been carried out in this state since 1953.
Sajpov, 30, reportedly used a rented truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and cyclists who came on his path in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will need to prove that Sajpov “deliberately” killed the eight victims and “deliberately” inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the statement demanding the death penalty, which was filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges are subject to the death penalty, according to the document submitted to the court.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury approved the indictment with 22 indictments, including eight counts of racketeering murder, typically an indictment used by federal prosecutors against organized crime, and an indictment of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and preparation," according to the prosecutors, and they described the manner in which Sajpov carried out the attack as "cruel, cruel and corrupt."
"Sajfoello Habiboellaevich Sajpov has inflicted injury, damage and loss on the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been more than a decade since a case in New York’s Southern District called for the death penalty.
The suspect, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after they had been convicted of espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were both executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Sajpov, from Uzbekistan, did not show any remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He let the detectives know that he felt good about his act, let alone the police.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in his room at the hospital, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the indictment with 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Sajpov, said he was "naturally disappointed" with the prosecutors' decision.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a confession in exchange for a life sentence without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all concerned," Patton said.
Sajpov’s defense had earlier asked the prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative MP Says NIGEL FARAGE Should Lead Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to mobilize a “people’s army” during a protest at the Conservative Party conference today.
The former leader of UKIP said politicians should feel the "heat" of the Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's own MPs proposed to give him the lead in negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told marchers in Birmingham that the UK "would be out already" if Mr. Farage had been Brexit minister.
But the challenge May faces in reconciling the heavily divided ranks is underscored by two pro-Remain conservatives who are participating in a separate anti-Brexit protest meeting in the city.
The prime minister struggles to keep her Chequers compromise on track as this is attacked by Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Comrades insisted that she will continue and try to make a deal with Brussels despite the setbacks, forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and "chaos".
Bone said at a meeting of Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he "wants to throw Chequers in the trash".
He suggested that Farage should be ridden and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was out of service, we’d be out now,” Bone said.
The Wellingborough MP added: “I will support Brexit, but we have to throw Chequers in the trash.”
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in two world wars to be subordinate.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone pointed out suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely untrue."
Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the march and told reporters: “I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition does not vote, it is unpopular within our party and with our activists who go from door to door and ensure that we are elected.
Drop the Chequers and listen."
In a message to May, she added: “Premiers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage told the meeting that politicians should “feel the heat” if they want to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them, ‘We’re not letting you get away with this.’”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to put the flames on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
We are mobilizing the army of this country that gave us the victory in the Brexit referendum and we will never rest until we have become an independent, sovereign, proud United Kingdom again.”
In the meantime, Remainers marched through Birmingham and ended this march with a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
A small group of activists waved flags on which Tories Against Brexit stood after the group was formed over the weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of Labour’s upper house, joked about the security issues of a Conservative party app at the start of their conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can provide IT systems and all technology for Canada plus plus, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to ‘think well’ about presidential candidacy
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “think carefully about her candidacy for the presidency” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat told about her future at a meeting in a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, wants to be re-elected in November against Geoff Diehl, a Republican MP who co-chaired the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been the center of speculation that she may be fighting Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in a town hall since Trump came to power.
One person asked her if she would be eligible for the presidency.
Warren replied that it is time for women to go to Washington to restore our failing government and that includes a woman at the top.
LSU's Wayde Sims Arrested After Shooting
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said Saturday that a suspect was arrested after shooting Wayde Sims, a basketball player from LSU on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, during an ET press conference at 11:00 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got a gunshot wound to the head and died of its consequences," police commander Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde stepped forward to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson has been questioned and is known to have been present at the scene of the crime, to have been in possession of a firearm and to have shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incident and is being held at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a junior 1.98-metre player who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games and started last season in 10 games. He averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after Sebastian Vettel left him the win after orders from team
When Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that team orders from Mercedes would play a role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from pole position and left Hamilton almost completely in the cold when he defended his position and Vettel invited his teammate to attack.
Vettel went into the pits and let Hamilton drive in the crowd in the tail of the group, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into the pits a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came up again after a wheel-to-wheel action which reluctantly required the Ferrari rider to release space on the inside after a double move in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the last place and was seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he was a long time leader of the race, because he stayed at his tyre choice and aimed for a quick finish, so that he could catch Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
Eventually, in the 44th round, he went to the pits, after he could not increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikkonen became fourth.
It's a tough day because Valtteri was doing a fantastic job all weekend. He was a real gentleman and left me behind.
The team did their best for the first and second places," Hamilton said.
That wasn't a good body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at an election rally Saturday over her persistence not being the source of Christine Blasey Ford’s leaked letter, in which Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was accused of assault.
Speaking at an election meeting in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about the testimony given by Ford to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Instead, he said that what took place in the Senate showed that people could be "common, nasty and untrue."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful show that takes place in the last days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you are the people who are angry and mean and mean and nasty and untrue," he said.
“When you look at the press releases and the leaks and then they say ‘oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Do you remember her answer... you leaked the document - 'oh, oh, what?
- Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
Well, wait a minute.
If we have leaked... No, we have not leaked,” he added, in an imitation of the senator.
In July, the letter in which the charges against Kavanaugh were reported to Feinstein was sent by Ford and this was leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that her desk was leaking.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to go with it confidentially and I treated it confidentially as she had asked.”
But the president turned out not to believe her denial and he commented on it during the meeting on Saturday night: "I'll tell you what, that wasn't a good body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, who is accused by three women of sexual misconduct, the president suggested that the Democrats used the accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to seize power, with all necessary means.
You see the community, the distaste, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to drive over to seize power and regain control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs Belfast Giants: 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars have settled Friday’s Elite League loss against the Belfast Giants by winning the return match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had names with two goals leading by scores of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie sided with the home team before Dwyer led the Giants again.
Francois Bouchard made the equaliser for Dundee, before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two goals.
It was the third loss in the Elite League this season for the men of Adam Keefe, who had to make up a setback on Friday night to then beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth time this season that the two teams met, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on an assist from Kendall McFaull. David Rutherford gave the assist with which Beauvillier doubled the lead, four minutes later.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt gave the lead for Cownie's equaliser at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants took the first rest with a lead, when he scored his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team picked up and Bouchard put them back on a par with a power-play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran then combined well to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the match, late in the second period. He ensured the victory with the fifth goal for his team, halfway in the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies while making sure hundreds of people can escape the earthquake in an airplane
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is honored as a hero after he died because he ensured that a plane with hundreds of people on board could safely take off.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are still missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Celebes on Friday; an earthquake that subsequently caused a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks still haunt the area and many are buried under the point in the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wild-moving traffic tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He continued to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was ready at the time on the runway, could safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the traffic jam when he thought it was about to collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australia’s ABC News reported.
We had arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning, before the helicopter had reached Palu.
“It breaks your heart when you hear it,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could rise to the thousands and told the country’s disaster agency that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is assumed that the death toll is still rising because many bodies were under the debris and have not yet been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves that reached a height of six meters have destroyed Palu, where a massive funeral ceremony will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute bodies are brought in by ambulances.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a race to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the soldiers present: "I call on all of you to work day and night so that all the tasks necessary for the evacuation are completed.
Are you ready for it?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
Plane Crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini Now Says One Man Is Missing After Lagoon Crash
The airline that carried out the flight that crashed into a Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia is now saying one more man is missing, having previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew had safely left the sunken plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that one male passenger was missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to questions about more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane was hit by water during the landing at the Chuukei Islands airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that everyone’s condition was stable.
What caused the crash and what is the exact order of events remains unclear for the time being.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both say the plane landed in the lagoon and missed the runway.
Some witnesses believe that the plane was shot over the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was approaching the airport very low.
"That's good news," Jaynes said.
Jaynes recounted that he and some others succeeded in wading the water, which came to their aid, to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the stewardesses were panicking and screaming and that he had a non-serious head injury.
The U.S. Navy announced that sailors who were in close proximity to work on a shipyard also helped with the rescue work by bringing people to shore on an inflatable boat before the plane sank further into the approximately 30-meter-deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that in the last twenty years 111 people have been killed in crashes of airlines registered with the PNG, but that this does not relate to Air Niugini.
Analyst records the timeline of the night on which a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor closed his requisite on Friday in the reopening trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified as a witness expert in the field of information analysis.
He made it clear to the jury how he had used mobile phone call data to capture the movements of the 29-year-old suspect, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he had received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was at Chambers on the night of her death, which contradicted his earlier claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to Sanford again.
Sanford was standing at the witness stand on Saturday and told that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he told him that he was at Sanford in his truck that night, Sanford said that he “lied because my truck was in Nashville then.”
Another inconsistency was that Tellis had told him that he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The cell phone records indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said Tellis erased the text messages, calls and contact details from his phone some time after Chambers' death.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense begins on Sunday with the closing arguments.
The judge said he expects the jury to begin the deliberations later that day.
The High Breed: What is 'conscious hiphop'?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol state that hip hop is alienated from its origins with political opinions and the catapulting of social problems.
They want to return to the roots and make 'conscious hiphop' popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently been revived in Britain by artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
A New York-based nurse challenges a couple in court over a 'racist' text
A New York-based childminder sues a couple for dismissal on discriminatory grounds after she received an erroneously sent text in which the mother complained about "such a black man again."
The couple denies being racist and calls the trial "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, showed her dismay when she discovered that the new baby girl, Giselle Maurice, turned out to be a Negro woman when she met her on her first day of work in 2016.
"Nothing is black again," Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Ms. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, the “uncomfortable” Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice when she realized her blunder, stating that their former child lady, who was African-American, had done a bad job, and that she had therefore expected a Filipino.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a working day and was then sent home by taxi.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple to get compensation of $350,-- per day for the 6 months for which she was hired to bifurcate internally with the family, albeit without a contract.
"I want them to feel like you just don't do something like that," Maurice told the New York Post last Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple bit off regarding the claim that she is racist by saying that it was reasonable to fire Maurice after they, by insulting her, were afraid that they could no longer trust her.
“My wife sent her a message that she didn’t want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” her husband Joel Plasco told the New York Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone who insulted you, even if it was by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Get out of here."
Comparing the lawsuit to "extortion," Plasco said his wife was expecting a baby in two months and was "in a very difficult situation."
"Are you going to prosecute someone like that?
That’s not so sympathetic,” the investment banker added.
While the lawsuit is still ongoing, public opinion is quick to capitulate the couple on social media, where they are hoarded for their behavior and reasoning.
The publishers of Paddington feared that the public would not have much interest in a talking bear, reveals newly appeared letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book's approval, said of the letter: "It's hard to get into the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time, even before the first publication.
With what we know now about Paddington’s huge success, it’s very entertaining.”
She said her father, who, before he was inspired to write the children's book about a small toy bear, worked as a cameraman at the British broadcaster BBC, was optimistic about whether his book would be rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book felt "bitterly sweet" after his death last year.
About Paddington, who she describes as "a very prominent member of the family," she said her father was secretly proud of the ultimate success.
She said, "He was a quiet, modest man."
“But because Paddington was so lifelike to him, it almost looked like a child’s achievement; you’re proud while you’ve done nothing for yourself.
I think he was about to experience Paddington's success.
Although Paddington was the creation of his own imagination, he honored the bear himself for success.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone
Immediately after the landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad had called several times to say that it looked very bad and that she was expected not to make it,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then Nad’s phone call came to say that she would die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, 'Tashi, I love your treasure so much.
We'll be back together soon.
Then I'll be with you again.
The medications that the doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping slowly became worked out and left her body.
She had been dead for some time before and this process turned everything off further.
I could just sit there, knowing what was going on.
I could not lament, cry or cry, because I was sitting in the middle of all kinds of people and families.
I really had to stay big.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the death of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what ordeal she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
"I was sitting with my head down and the tears just kept coming.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I got an overwhelming sense of compassion for Nad.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Grieving women paste messages on bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones by suicide make a strong effort to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys paste inspiring messages and phone numbers that people in need can call for help on a bridge in Wales
Ms. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he first became depressed and he committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Ms. Davis, 45 years old and living in Lydney in Gloucestershire, England, says her son was a promising chef with an infectious grin.
“He was known for his smile.
It was always said that his smile brightened every room.”
Yet he stopped working before his death because he was deep in the pit.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, found him after he robbed himself of his life.
Ms. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that there's a chain reaction."
Ms. Davis made the cards; 'to let people know that there are others you can go to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don’t be silent – talk about it.”
Ms. Humphreys, who has been friends with Ms. Davies for years, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother died.
“He didn’t say he felt gloomy or depressed or anything,” she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was sitting on the floor on Christmas Day – when the kids picked up their presents, he didn’t look at them at all or anything.”
She said that his death was a big trauma for her, but that they have to deal with it: "It's tearing the whole family apart.
It's driving us apart.
But we all have to keep fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future uncertain as FBI investigates
"I thought that if we could really get what he's asking for; an investigation limited in time and scope, we might be able to create a little more unity again," Mr Flake said last Saturday, adding that he was afraid the committee was falling apart, anchored in the middle of a tight patch.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to set up an investigation?
Their restraint has everything to do with timing.
The midterm elections are already over five weeks, on November 6, and if, as expected, the Republicans are doing badly, their attempts to get their husband elected to the highest court in the country are seriously hampered.
George W. Bush has already called with members of the U.S. Senate to lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and thus got to know his wife Ashley, who the Bush was his personal secretary.
What happens if the FBI finishes the report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can count on at least 50 votes in the Senate, and that would give Mike Pence, vice president, the opportunity to cast the deciding vote to confirm Kavanaugh’s appointment to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of runners 'down' under Kim
According to a South Korean lawmaker, the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, says there were 1,127 runners last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park notes that stricter border controls between North Korea and China, and higher penalties for human smugglers are the main factors for the decline.
Pyongyang has not responded in public.
The vast majority of passers-by from North Korea are eventually offered South Korean nationality.
According to sources in Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled via China, which has the longest external border with North Korea and where it is easier to cross than in the heavily secured demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers the invaders as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly deports them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still formally capable of war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, where they discussed the stagnant denuclearization negotiations.
This meeting came after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, where they broadly agreed to work towards the Korean peninsula’s nuclear dismantling.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the U.S. of failing to make progress in lifting U.S. sanctions since then.
“Without faith in U.S. action, confidence in our national security is also lacking, and under those circumstances there is no first step of unilateral disarmament,” Ri said in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and finds him incapable of serving in the Supreme Court
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called U.S. Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and finds him incapable of serving in the Supreme Court
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman behaved like that, they would call her 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional; he almost screamed at times and was especially upset when he told about his family and his high school years.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the accusations against him “great and coordinated character murder,” organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi stated that she felt that Kavanaugh's testimony demonstrated that he was not fit to serve on the Supreme Court because he was full of prejudices against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way he talks about the Clintons and the Democrats,” Pelosi said.
Pelosi protested when asked if she would try to institute impeachment proceedings against Kavanaugh if he was appointed, and the Democrats would get a majority in the House of Representatives.
"If he doesn't tell the truth in Congress, or against the FBI, then he's not only unsuitable for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he serves now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the District of Columbia District Court of Appeals (usually abbreviated to D.C.).
Pelosi added that she was concerned as a Democrat that Kavanaugh would go against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v Wade because Kavanaugh is known as a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh circumvented questions about the review of certain Supreme Court decisions during confirmation hearings.
“Don’t expect us to be cheering when a hysterical, prejudiced person is appointed to the Supreme Court,” Pelosi said.
Women just have to admit it.
It’s a righteous tidal wave of months and years of crumbled anger that overflows, and she can only cry to get it out.
“We’ll cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s weird, do you?”
She continued, "I'm tremendously helped by a woman who was in charge somewhere who told me that she was going to cry when she got angry. She developed a method where she was going to cry whenever she got angry. To the one she was talking to, she said, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept crying.
I just thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are partly allowed as an expression of anger, because crying is essentially misunderstood.
One of my best surviving memories from a previous job, in a male-dominated office, is when I had to cry terribly because I was so angry. An older woman, a chilly business manager that everyone was a little afraid of, grabbed me in my neck and slid me into a staircase.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're glad they got you in the closet.

In 1987, when Mr. Hart was involved in an extramarital affair aboard a boat called 'Monkey Business' (informally meaning 'cat-evil' or 'ape-streaks') and retired from the race, the deeply disappointed Mrs. Schroeder felt there was no reason why she would not stand up to herself.
"It wasn't a well-considered decision," she told me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone was talking about "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because the campaign was already advanced, she was lagging behind with fundraising, and so she solemnly promised not to participate if she could not raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who would give men $1000, wanted to give her only $250.
“Maybe they think I’m getting a discount?” she asked.
When she gave her speech announcing that she would not start a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings — of gratitude for the people who had supported her, of frustration because the system made it so difficult to raise money, and to reach voters instead of deputies, and of anger about sexism — that she sneezed into it.
“You will have thought I had a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder recalled how the media reacted to her.
“They will have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my gravestone?
"They're crying?"
How the U.S.-China trade war can turn out beneficial for Beijing
The opening salvos of the U.S.-China trade war were ear-numbing, and although the fight has not yet been fought, a gap between the two countries could, according to experts, bridge long-term benefits for Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump earlier this year issued the first warning by raising taxes on major Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation was announced this week when new effective, increased tax rates were unveiled for $200 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 billion) in goods; half of all goods coming from China to the US.
Beijing has taken reprisals in kind each time, most recently by raising tariffs from 5 to 10% for $60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has vowed to match the U.S. every time, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to blink.
In order for Washington to bow, requests must be granted, but public bowing for the US is far too painful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts argue that if Beijing plays smart, the trade war with the US could positively support China in the longer term, as the mutual dependence of the two economies decreases.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that could result in one of the two countries falling into an economic free fall is actually much more dangerous than spectators have previously acknowledged," said Abigail Grace, a researcher at the Center for a New American Security (CNS) research center.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by a war lasting more than seven years.
During his speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem declared that conditions in his country are improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas devastated by terrorists, and to normalize the situation on the ground.
All circumstances are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that threatened their daily lives and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
It is estimated that there are about six million people in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in restoring the devastated country.
However, he stressed that Syria would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that had subsidized the uprising.
Europe wins the 'Ryder Cup' in Paris
The European team won the '2018 Ryder Cup' by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 on the golf course 'Le Golf National' southwest of Paris in France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil, and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title when the team of the Danish leader Thomas Bjorn scored the necessary number of 14.5 points to defeat the US.
The star of the American team, Phil Mickelson, who was wrestling almost the entire tournament, landed his long shot from the tee in the water at par 3, hole 16, and conceded his loss to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, excelled in all his rounds and became one of the four players who ever scored 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current form in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was thrown out by the lowest scoring European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, with 5 holes down and 4 holes to play.
The highest ranked player on the world rankings, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 holes down and 1 hole to play by Ian Poulter from Great Britain, who possibly played his last match in the Ryder Cup.
Spaniard Segrio Garcia, a veteran with eight Ryder Cups, became the best European player of all tournaments ever with 25.5 points in his career.
"I'm not crying so fast, but today I can't do anything about it.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas that he selected me and believed in me.
I'm so glad we got the cup back.
It’s about the team, and I’m glad I could help,” said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his fellow countryman, John Ram, who beat American legend Tiger Woods with 2 holes down and 1 hole to go in the singles game on Sunday.
"The enormous pride I feel for defeating Tiger Woods, I always followed that guy when I was growing up," Rahm, 23, said in a statement.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic from one of the greatest players ever; winner of 14 major championships, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled the weekend to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at a high level throughout the tournament.
The American leader, Jim Furyk, said after his team's disappointing performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
Shortly this morning, we made Europe a little bit more difficult.
We offered resistance.
All due respect to Thomas.
He's a great leader.
All 12 players on his team played very well.
I'm going to work with the American PGA (Professional Golfers' Association) and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're looking forward.
I love these 12 guys and I am proud to be their leader.
You have to take off your hat for the opponent.
We have been overplayed.”
