Shouting to the world
The market campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland seems to have gone well and the screams and calls out in nature have begun to attract people all over the world.
“You have the talent, I need Iceland,” says a woman out in the big world in a commentary on an advertisement from the marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland on the material company YouTube.
Another spectator will keep Iceland in her heart for all eternity and a young woman says she has to come to Iceland as soon as possible after her boyfriend has settled there.
Unfortunately, she’s in the United States, so she’ll have to wait a few more months.
Another spectator asks if the walking route to Iceland is possible, because there are no planes.
It does not follow the story if he comes from another time zone.
Egill <0xC3><0x9E><0xC3><0xB3>r<0xC3><0xB0>arson at the advertising agency Peel, which made the announcements together with the international advertising agency M&C Saatchi, says receptions have hopefully been further.
“I came across many Inspired By Iceland campaigns that went very well but this new campaign is already starting to hit the mark.
Basically, it’s about creating PR value, it’s about getting foreign media to discuss the campaign, and it’s been going incredibly well.
In a relatively short period of time, we have received coverage in about seven hundred media outlets around the world, which together reach just under two billion people.
The value of that coverage is priced at ISK 1.8 billion.
It's not awkward."
The main market of all is the United States and the campaign has gone very well there although the Americans are not on their way to the country in the near future.
According to Egils, well-known market areas such as Denmark, the United Kingdom and Germany have also taken note, such as Russia, which is pleasantly surprised.
Then there was a reaction from foreign regions, such as India, which was not specifically addressed.
“These ads have traveled farther than we’ve ever imagined,” says Egill, but it’s possible that over four million people have watched the content on YouTube.
“We couldn’t have asked for a better start.”
The photos here at the opening were taken by <0xC3><0x81>rni S<0xC3><0xA6>berg, a photographer at Morgunblad<0xC3><0xB0>in, who took on advertisements with the headline “Let It Out” in the middle of last month.
The recordings took place broadly, such as at the School Guarding Trails in Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k, in Reynisfjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur, at Sk<0xC3><0xB3>garfoss, at S<0xC3><0xB3>lheimajökal and in a cave at Hjörleifshöf<0xC3><0xB0>.
The directors were Samuel Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar P<0xC3><0xA1>ll <0xC3><0x93>lafsson at Skoti productions and <0xC3><0x93>ttar Gu<0xC3><0xB0>nasson.
Other Icelandic actors were Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, who is from Cuba and Hungary.
Dozens of Icelanders made the announcements, but at the same time that the recordings were made in the South, there was another group in the West and Westfjords.
According to Egils, "Let It Out" is only the first episode of the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, but is aimed at a winter campaign in collaboration with M&C Saatchi.
“This is just the first phase in this work for <0xC3><0x8D>slandsstof,” says Egill, adding that the collaboration with M&C Saatchi has been extremely successful.
“It’s great to work with them.
In such projects, it is very important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the markets we are talking to."
Explosives: Discuss the position on the labour market, pension funds and much more
<0xC3><0x81>smundur Einar Da<0xC3><0xB0>ason, Minister of Social Affairs and Children’s Affairs, will meet in Sprengisand, which starts at 10 a.m. on the Wave today.
He is also Minister of Labour and discusses the position on the labour market as such, the Icelandair case and more.
He also discusses rural issues and transportation work out to a country that has gone badly and has been disputed over the past years and decades.
Ragnar <0xC3><0x9E><0xC3><0xB3>r Ing<0xC3><0xB3>lfsson, Chairman of the Board of Trustees, will also attend the event, but he will discuss his criticisms regarding the investments of pension funds and put forward ideas that labour movements and employers will withdraw from the boards of trustees to reduce the risk of interest.
<0xC3><0x8D>var Ingimarsson, the tourism service provider in the East, and <0xC3><0x81>rnhei<0xC3><0xB0>i J<0xC3><0xB3>hannsd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir, the director of the Nordic Market Institute, will discuss the position of tourism services in the countryside.
They will look forward to the autumn and wonder if the success of the summer is a misleading proclamation of what is to come.
You can listen to the show below, but it starts at 10 a.m.
This is what it looks like 25 years later.
Actress Elisa Donovan had a successful career in all kinds of youth roles.
However, she became famous for her role as Amber in the film Clueless 25 years ago.
She also starred in Sabrina: The Teenage Witch, Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury, and Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married with one child.
Little has worn her lately, but she did get to look over the way and express herself about Clueless in Australian television in the days.
She talks beautifully about Brittany Murphy who died unexpectedly in 2009 and says she has been a great person.
“I have to admit that I built the personality of the majority on girls I met in schools that weren’t good to me.
As soon as I read the script, I knew who these characters were," Donovan said of his play in Clueless.
He did not want to leave the police station after overnight stay.
About fifty cases were brought to the police in the capital area today and the police diary says that the cases have been diversified.
The day at the police station in Verffisgata began with the police having to replace a man who had recently been released from a prison cell after staying there because of an intoxication.
The man did not want to go away after he was released and did not obey the orders of the police who told him to leave.
The man went to the police station for a long time because of his injuries.
A man was arrested this morning on suspicion of burglary at a company in Kopavogur.
Police also had to have a replacement of two people in Brei<0xC3><0xB0>holt because of reports of a body attack.
It also happened that a woman who was sitting at a shopping mall in Kopavogi could not pay for the bill at the end of the meal and was therefore called to the police.
There was also a car theft in the city centre this morning.
A driver whitewashed a Renault transponder looking at her for a moment and she was then taken by unfree hand.
The car was not found.
The Curse of the Joy Team - The Horrible Destiny of the Glee Stars
This theory has reached flight on the Internet to a curse resting on the series about the Joy Squad, but the actress Naya Rivera drowned in California in those days and thus became the third main actor of the series to make life far before age.
The Glee series is a popular series about singing, dancing, and joie de vivre.
The episodes focused on the so-called joy group of young people in high school, their love and fate.
It was not always taken out with the luck to be in the joy group but through singing and dancing the characters of the actors seemed to overcome every situation that came up in their lives.
But outside the scene, great disasters have struck the players and staff of the actors, so much so that theories have awoken about the curse resting on the shows.
Naya Marie Rivera took on the role of Santona Lopez in the series, a clapper who did not call all her grandmother.
After the series had run its course, Rivera went to have actor Ryan Dorsey and had with him his first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and subsequently divorced.
Dorsey, however, refused to make a plea and the domestic violence case was dropped.
On July 8, it was reported that Rivera was missing after her four-year-old son was found alone in a boat on Lake Piru, California.
The boy was found sleeping in a life jacket on board the boat, and he could tell the police that he and his mother had plunged into the water and Rivera would have brought him back to the boat but never returned to it himself.
There was a huge search for Rivera.
The day after the search began, the chief of police in the area found out that the search had been carried out assuming Rivera had drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found and was officially sentenced to death.
It is believed that she fell into a heavy current in the water and used her last demands in saving her son.
Dana's cause was recorded as drowned by accidents.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith played the role of Finn Hudson in the series, the American footballer with the angelic voice who played a key role in bringing the Joy Team to fame and respect.
However, Moneith struggled with a personal devil.
From the age of 13, he had struggled with addiction and found it difficult to escape it.
In 2013, his co-workers found enough in the shows, intervened and urged him to seek help.
Moneith then went into treatment and everything seemed to look better.
Just two months after completing his treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after going out to have fun with friends.
Banamein was found to be a deadly mixture of liquor and alcohol.
I didn’t think it was intentional.
Moneith had gone into treatment and his tolerance for intoxication had decreased so much that a dose he had previously tolerated well proved fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His death weighed heavily on his associates, but at the behest of his rival, Lea Michele, he decided to continue taking the roles and dedicated them to the memory of Moneith and his character Finn.
Mark Wayne Salling went with the role of Noah "Puck" Puckerman in the series, Puck was an American footballer, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow members of the Joy Squad, or until he gained the courage to admit that he enjoyed dancing and seeing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his Los Angeles home on suspicion of custody of child abuse.
While searching his home, a huge amount of child abuse was found and the matter was soon asked out publicly.
It was clear that Salling had already been there.
He was subsequently charged and charged with his crime.
He had over his head four to seven years in prison in addition to the fact that he would have to be on a list of sex offenders and seek treatment for child abuse.
Before the judge had decided on the punishment, Salling, who was then free from insurance, was found dead near his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
It wasn’t just actors who fell from a long time ago.
Jim Fuller was the assistant director of the show.
He fell asleep in 2013 at the age of 41.
The show also featured a woman named Nancy Motes.
She was the younger sister of star Julia Roberts and did not carry her sister's beautiful story, but she accused Roberts of great governance and disrespectful behavior.
Motes took her own life in 2014 but she struggled with severe depression.
She left a letter to her fiancée in which she told her mother and sister, among other things, to be responsible for how she was treated.
“My mother and my so-called siblings get nothing after me except the memory that it was they who caused my worst depression.”
Lea Michel was the star of the show.
She has recently been accused of applying her intermediaries’ wits and obsessions to the scene and being with obsolete astrologers.
Jesse Luken made a guest appearance on the show in 2012.
He was arrested and charged with an intoxication in 2019, which was deeply shocking.
Actress Heather Morris played a major role in the series.
In 2010, she became the subject of nectar-pictures by undocumented computer enthusiasts published on the Internet.
The actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both played in the shows and had a love affair outside of the shows.
Benoist later reported that Jenner had abused her in the relationship.
You can put flowers on almost anything.
It increases the development of children when they get to play outside in the garden with their parents to grow flowers and get to watch them grow and mature.
It is also endlessly possible to do with flowers as Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Having a good time with your kids in the park is something you will never forget.
They will remember the flowers, the scent and, of course, the precious time they had with their parents.
Buying a boat in the 10th grade
“I don’t think we’re many sailors working in the country’s kindergartens,” says Axel <0xC3><0x96>rn Gu<0xC3><0xB0>mundsson, who practises beach hunting in the summer but studies psychology at the University of Iceland over the winter.
Beach fishing is a very comfortable summer job when you are studying.
If you fish well, you can have a good income and I think it’s great to be able to drop out of college.
The income also fits me well into the winter," says Axel <0xC3><0x96>rn Gu<0xC3><0xB0>mundsson, a 25-year-old psychologist, who spends the summer on beach hunting, just like the last few.
Axel was the most recent to dock at T<0xC3><0xA1>lknafyrad when a reporter spoke of him late in the evening at the beginning of the week."
“The winter I was in 10th grade, I took the boating rights for boats that are under 12 meters long and I bought my boat in the summer after I finished elementary school.
I’ve been fishing on my own boat ever since.
I bought the boat used by my acquaintance, Hartmann the son of Jonah, and I gave the boat his name.
Hartmann became an adult when I bought the boat and stopped being at sea and he was very pleased when he saw that the boat was bearing his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took the boat," Axel said, adding that he had bought the boat for three million euros.
“I made a deal with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of the summer and the other half at the end of the summer when I had finished fishing.
So I had the boat free at the end of my first summer on it."
But how could a boy have had one and a half million dollars to pay out on a boat when he had just finished elementary school?
“I had proposed and raised money, I had been working with my father at sea when I was a boy, I was all a bit of a hunter with him and got my share.
I also put my fermentation money in my boat's treasury."
Axel was born in <0xC3><0x8D>safjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur, where all his mothers live, but he has lived in Kopavogur since he was a boy.
“I can fish here in the western region because I have a legal home with my grandmother in <0xC3><0x8D>safjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur.
I studied in this area for the west of the rows with my father.
I’m moving between distances depending on how I feel, because this hunting area covers the whole of the Westfjords.
Although I feel best to be for the west, I have also provided around Sn<0xC3><0xA6>fellsnes and beyond.
I have also provided for the south, but preferably a grasshopper," says Axel, who always roams one early in the morning and sometimes says to talk to the mavans and sing in front of the sky, in solitary hours together on the beach.
“The internet connection on the ocean is good, so I can call, listen to radio shows and music.
I don’t mind being alone on the boat.
Of course, I try to avoid crashing into a boat, but there have certainly been times when the weather has been unusual, but there has never been much risk," said Axel, who is lucky to have never been seasick.
He says the length of the workday depends on how the hunts go each time.
“I’ve never been on a beach hunt for more than 14 hours at a time, but I’ve also been hunting in other systems, for example, in the rental quota, but then I’ve been out on the sea for a day and a half.”
According to the agreement, he is allowed to fish 770 kilos per day, which he finds inhibiting.
“Other obstacles are that I can’t fish on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and I can only fish 12 days a month, these four months that beach fishing lasts, in May, June, July and August.
In my opinion, sailors should choose their hunting days according to the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is on men to rest instead of having 48 days throughout the summer and can choose according to their heads.
So the regionalization could also go for me because of the sea space that is well located with the fishing should get to enjoy it," says Axel, who draws most of the cod from the salty sea on his beach fishing trips, but also only ufsa and unique other species flow with.
Axel works over the winter with his university degree at N<0xC3><0xBA>pi Elementary School in K<0xC3><0xB3>pavogi.
“I don’t think we’re many sailors working in the country’s kindergartens,” Axel says proudly, adding that he only intended to work temporarily at the kindergarten.
“I’m stuck there because I think it’s a great job.
I hope that the psychology course will be used to me at the preschool level in the future," says Axel, who also has a long way to go in business studies.
Error in the registration prevented home inspections
An error in the registration form that people fill out when they arrive in the country caused an individual living here in the country not to be called back to sampling.
It is not necessary to register a teacher number if the person fills out the form in English, as is the case when it is done in Icelandic.
“This will be examined this week,” says an expert in the field of epidemiology.
Three interns were diagnosed at the Department of virology of the Landspital yesterday.
One of those who proved positive arrived in the country on July 15, two days after the rules on so-called home inspection came into force.
Those who lived in Iceland are then screened upon arrival in the country and again announced in sampling four to five days later.
It was reported in the R<0xC3><0x9A>V afternoon news that the person concerned had, however, followed the old system.
The sample at the border was negative and he was not called back for screening for the virus.
Kamilla Rut Sigf<0xC3><0xBA>sd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir, a specialist in the field of epidemiology, says in a conversation with the news agency that this may indicate an error in the electronic journal.
Filling out the registration form in English is not a prerequisite to insert a teacher number similar to the Icelandic version.
First and foremost, it was intended for foreign tourists.
Therefore, the person did not receive an automatic invitation to come to the sampling.
Kamilla says many, however, have adhered to the rules of the home inspection even though they have filled out the registration form in English and in some cases employers have also been alert to sending people back to the sample after it arrived in the country.
“This week we will look at how to make it easier for people to get their attention in the process.”
The man is in isolation and six have been placed in solitary confinement.
They all went for a sampling, but two had started to show symptoms.
The smearing is currently underway for the three infections that were detected yesterday, but it is mostly completed due to two infections reported on Friday.
In both cases, the Icelandic genetic analysis has revealed that there are variants of the coronavirus that have not been found here before.
In the second case, the bands have pointed out that Israel, although it is known that the person who brought the virus to the country had also travelled to other European countries.
Kamilla says it should be tomorrow where the virus is coming from.
There are currently 15 in isolation according to the COVID.is web.
There are 135 of them.
Four out of five infections unrelated
There have been five domestic incidents in the country in recent days.
Of these, four are completely unrelated and, to illustrate, have not yet found the origin of the infection that occurred at the Rey Cup sports tournament yesterday.
Smashing is still ongoing.
Originally, in the 13th century, there were only a handful of them, but they were reduced to sixteen.
In total, there are 34 infections due to these new infections that were detected yesterday.
This is the second time in a short time that an infection has been detected at a sporting event and it has raised questions about whether such an event will take place.
J<0xC3><0xB3>hann K. J<0xC3><0xB3>hannsson, communications director at the National Police Director’s Department of Public Safety, says it well, as long as people follow standards and rules.
“We are constantly warning all those who live here that it is necessary to maintain individual-linked infectious agents.
We also need to warn people who are holding events that there are certain rules in place that need to be followed.
Then you can have an event," says John.
He says that contagion can be prevented by holding an individual contagion in the air.
In addition, the rules and criteria are in constant review.
“What needs to be done, and what the Department of Public Health and the National Health Service are constantly pressing for people, is to consider these individual-linked infectious agents.
Both at home and in the service industry as well.
People wash their hands and drink alcohol.
This prevents the infection from continuing," says J<0xC3><0xB3>hann.
“We need to urge people to continue on the good path we’ve been on, in order to keep up with the success we’ve achieved so far.”
40% of victims of COVID-19 were with diabetes 2
Devon Brumfield heard on the phone how difficult it was for her father to catch his breath.
Her father had diabetes, and she encouraged him to seek medical attention.
The next day he was dead.
The death was triggered by sudden breathing difficulties due to Coronavirus infection.
Diabetes was listed on the death certificate as an underlying problem, and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, is afraid that the same thing will happen.
The Reuters news agency says Brumfield's fears are not unfounded.
A recent study by the U.S. government found that nearly 40 percent of those who died of diabetes 2 were the underlying disease.
When the proportion of those who had not reached the age of 65 is examined, the proportion increases by half.
A study by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (CDC) involved more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died from the coronavirus between February and May.
Jonathan Wortham, an infectious disease expert at the CDC, says the findings are striking, not least for those diagnosed with diabetes 2 and their loved ones.
Was concealed in slow growth Reuters allowed to do a survey and indicate the responses from the 12 states that responded to comparable rates.
10 states, including California, Arizona, and Colombia, have not yet begun to identify the underlying diseases.
“Diabetes was already a slow-growing epidemic.
Now COVID-19 has broken through as a powerful century," said Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Diabetes is more common among blacks and people of South American descent, who have also worsened out of the coronavirus.
One of the best protections for those with diabetes 2 is to keep the disease at bay with exercise, a loyal diet and the help of health professionals.
The Coronavirus era, however, has made it difficult for many to maintain a routine.
Then, high insulin prices have consumed some to continue attending to work and thus to be exposed to the virus.
Reuters points out that the US authorities may have been aware of the danger that those with diabetes 2 could be caused by the virus.
By the time the SARS coronavirus was over in 2003, more than 20% of those infected had the disease, and in the 2009 swine flu pandemic, this group was three times more likely to have to be hospitalized.
When MERS did so in 2012, a study found that 60% of those who died or were hospitalized had diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a scientist at Yale University, says that because the effects of the COVID-19 virus could last longer, the epidemic may have removed the cover of a number of previously unknown complications.
“I’m afraid we’ll see a flood of problems when this is over,” said Andrew Bolton, president of the International Diabetes Association.
Physicians have warned that the Coronavirus age may indirectly lead to an increase in diabetic complications, including kidney disease and renal diagnosis.
As well, new research directs that the coronavirus could lead to a proliferation of cases of diabetes.
Reuters says scientists are trying to understand the link between coronavirus and diabetes mellitus 2.
The virus affects the heart, lungs and kidneys, organs that are already weak in many people with diabetes.
Then a high ratio of glucose to lipids in diabetics can cause a true ‘cellular bulge storm’, as it is called when the immune system overreacts and attacks the body.
Damaged adhesion cells can also lead to inflammation, which in turn can cause a deadly blood clot.
“It’s all one big puzzle game,” says Dela Cruz.
“It’s all about each other.”
The news has been corrected.
“We were offered champagne, so they left the room.”
<0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>n Magn<0xC3><0xBA>sd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir and Atli Bollason had sex in front of a camera with the unusual bonus from the artist Ragnari Kjartanssjoni for works that the artist was putting up in Paris.
“We loved each other so it wasn’t difficult.”
Atli Bollason never forgets when he first met his wife and mother, <0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>na Magn<0xC3><0xBA>sd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir.
“I was very fascinated by her.
Of course, it was just the radiation, but so I thought it was also quite inexplicably cute.
And still does," he says.
Asr<0xC3><0xBA>n also remembers the end of the husband's first meeting regularly.
“I’ve always heard this story.
Just last weekend," she says, which also appealed to her husband at the first meeting.
“I found and feel so much adolescence around Atla, which I like.
There’s a lot going on and a lot going on and I’m fascinated by it.”
Atli says that the couple have emphasized it in their relationship to go their own way.
“We don’t tie our bags to the same knots as the passengers.
We avoid the routines that surround us.”
That’s probably why they took the story from Ragnar Kjartan’s son, the artist, just applauding, although it would be uncommon to say the least.
“Krist<0xC3><0xAD>n Anna, our mutual friend, has contacted us and asked if we could come and have a dessert with her, Ragga and Ingibjörga, Ragnar’s wife, on Snaps.”
They accepted the invitation, met the trio on Snaps and got themselves a dessert wine and one dessert each.
They listened to Ragnar who led them through his plans for a painting exhibition that he planned to set up at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris in the fall.
“He had a multi-grass video work called Scenes from Western Culture.
He described it in a simple way.”
<0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>n says he described the work as a banal and decadent passage from the everyday lives of Westerners.
“He had sketches of all the sessions he was going to shoot and last time he told us what he wanted to know if we were interested in participating.”
Later, Ragnar asked the couple to participate in the show was to show a young interlocutor couple that loved in a minimalist room.
“These are relationships with beginning and end,” says Atli.
The couple did not know Ragnar much, though they knew of him and he of them “but they knew us and found us fit in this.
They said they didn’t want to advertise to people.
Maybe they thought that they would not get the right people, but people who were sexually deprived of performing for others.”
They applauded Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it didn’t take long.
“When we came out of Snaps, we said, ‘Aren’t we just in this?’
It was just like that.
I trust Ragnar as an artist and his entire team," says Asrun and Atli.
“It’s about love and love.”
Later, he was taken to a nice apartment on Myrargatan.
There was a very small film crew; a filmmaker, Ragnar and a musician and a couple.
After the lights had been turned on, everyone left the room to wait outside in a car except Atli and <0xC3><0x81>srun.
“We didn’t decide what we were going to be.
We were given a little guidance, but we tried to forget the time and place.
To be unaware of what we were doing and for whom.
It wasn’t a game, we just loved each other so it wasn’t complicated,” Asrun says.
But was it romantic?
“Yes, it was a bit romantic,” Atli and <0xC3><0x81>srun agree.
“We were invited to a champagne before they left the room.
It was a bit like being on holiday in a nice hotel in Paris."
The team was pleased with the performance of the couple in the work that moved with them.
“When the Tommi catcher looked at this, he cried, he thought it was so beautiful,” Atli says.
“It’s about love and closeness and the relationships themselves,” Asrun says.
The parents of the couple have seen the work and Atli says that his mother heard the voice in his son at the Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k Art Museum and then realized that he was part of the work.
“Then she turns around and starts to get into it,” Atli says.
My mom and dad saw it in Paris.
“We didn’t tell anyone like that, but Dad just texted me and said, ‘It’s great to see the little family in the Palais de Tokyo.’”
And did the participation in the work deepen the relationship between <0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>n and Atla?
“At least we’re still together so maybe it deepened something.
This at least deepened my relationship with the related family," says <0xC3><0x81>srun and laughs.
<0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>n himself saw the work in Copenhagen with his colleague.
“I found it a little difficult not to be with you but someone else,” she says, turning to her husband.
“But it was nice to see this because it’s just a late one in a much bigger work and when you see this with the other works it’s really cool.
I was able to get away from it and I was just proud.
And there was a little bean in my stomach," says Asrun, who was unmarried to the second child of the couple when the latter was taken up.
“It was just beautiful.”
Anna Marsibil Clausen talked to them about <0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>na and Atla in Love Stories on Route 1.
Swansea wins in the previous round
Swansea won 1-0 at Brentford in a dramatic game.
This was the first game of the team in the finals of the competition to make it to the English national team.
The game took place in Swansea, Wales.
The second half was 0-0.
Homers in Swansea were victorious in the 64th minute, but Andre Ayew broke the scoreboard from the victor's point of view and left to defend himself.
Just two minutes later, Rico Henry, a Brentford player, got the red card.
Brentford played the rest of the game one less and in the 82nd minute the Swansea players took advantage of the team.
Andre Ayew then improved the winning streak by scoring a superb goal and securing Swansea's 1–0 win.
Swansea lead 1-0 in the singles, but the second game will take place on Wednesday at home in Brentford.
Unemployment rate for five years since 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the U.S. ambassador to Iceland, is in the spotlight after CBS reported this morning that he wanted an armed lifeguard because he feared for his life.
However, it has not been without difficulty for the President of the United States to appoint an ambassador to the country.
Since Carol Van Voorst resigned as U.S. ambassador in April 2009, she has been without a U.S. ambassador for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst resigned under unusual circumstances, but Kastlj<0xC3><0xB8>s stated from 2009 that she should have been given the Falcon Order.
On the way to a farewell meeting with the President of Iceland, she received a phone call from the Bureau of the President on the subject that she would not be honored with the word.
After she left Iceland, she taught international relations at Army War College.
Sixteen months passed until Van Voorst's successor came to work, in September 2010.
There is some evidence that Robert S. Connan had been appointed ambassador, but that was not the case.
Loius Ariega had been working in the foreign service for a decade.
He resigned in the autumn of 2013 and assumed the post of ambassador to Guatemala.
It was a second unresolved period.
Robert Barber received the approval of the U.S. Congress in January 2015 and came to work shortly after, but then no ambassador had been there for 13 months.
Barber was a political appointee, not a diplomat, but had worked as a lawyer and supported the election fund of Barack Obama.
He quit his job as soon as Donald Trump took office on January 20, 2017, as is customary with a politically appointed ambassador.
The Trump administration was unusual in appointing both ambassadors and high-ranking officials to the Washington system.
So it was two years before the U.S. Congress announced Jeffrey Ross Gunter at its meeting to ask him the spears out and confirm the end as ambassador to Iceland.
In his testimony at the parliament, he said he had never come to Iceland but often to Western Europe, but his wife, who was killed, had been broken by a Dutch rock.
Gunter is a political appointee, was a former dermatologist in California and has been prominent in the Republican Jewish Coalition.
Sheldon Adelson founded the association, but Adelson is a strong supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter joined Iceland in May 2019, but no ambassador had been in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest in the country.
The reason is both how long the Trump administration has been appointing people to key positions and that in recent years the work of the U.S. Congress has been greatly stretched over the long term, including confirming an ambassador in office.
Since 2009, he has been an ambassador to Iceland for more than five years.
However, this has not prevented the construction of the embassy, which opened its new headquarters at Engjateig.
The constructions are estimated to have cost about 6.5 billion, but the core thickness of the safety walls surround the building and the glass is shot in all windows.
However, it does not seem to have enough to fill the current ambassador with a sense of security because he is said to be afraid for his life and has wished for an armed lifeguard.
Former <0xC3><0x8D>BV player became racist in Iceland - "It was a mistake to come to Iceland"
Tonny Mawejje, a former <0xC3><0x8D>BV player, says he was racist when he was in Iceland and that he is looking forward to having arrived in the country.
This is revealed in an interview with Tonny, who appeared on the Ugandan Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined the Uganda Police FC team as a player in the top division of Uganda.
In an interview with Daily Monitor, Tonny talks about many things, including his time here in Iceland while playing with <0xC3><0x8D>BV, Val and <0xC3><0x9E>r<0xC3><0xB3>tti in Iceland.
“When I came to Iceland, I didn’t play in the middle as I used to play.
The team's front team was in that position but also he was with the jersey number I wanted so I got neither of what I wanted," says Tonny while he played on the right side of the season with <0xC3><0x8D>BV.
Among what Tonny talks about is the racism that he became involved in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players face when they play in Europe.
“It happened to me once, but since I didn’t understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me.
Then I heard about it, and I asked my friend what it was all about.
He then told me that my opponent had a racist comment about me after I tapped him."
In 2014, Tonny moved from Iceland to Norway where he joined Haugesund.
He says he has made the most of the mistakes he sees.
Tonny had not managed to get into the starting team at Haugesund but he wanted to play more to get into the national team.
Then he asked him to go back to Iceland on a loan, but he joined the team with Val.
“It was a mistake to come back to Iceland on a loan.
I think if I had been in Norway longer, I would have had the opportunity that I wanted," Tonny said, hoping that if he played well in Norway, he would probably get longer.
He wants to say that the loan to Iceland has fulfilled his dreams of getting into the big city in Europe.
found me in a woman's throat
Doctors at St. Luke’s International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8-cm-long black snake in the throat of a woman who was looking for it.
The doctor managed to pull the snake out with a tongue.
The research revealed that it was a parasitic animal.
CNN is reporting on this.
The woman had eaten sashimi a few days before, which are thin slices of meat.
The woman recovered quickly after the worm was removed, but parasites such as these are often found in raw meat or fish.
After sushi went to bed in the West, cases where parasites have spread to people have increased, according to CNN.
Fears that another wave is starting in Europe
Spain is now at the forefront of concerns about the second wave of the coronavirus in Europe, where the government has taken action to reintroduce the spread of the coronavirus age.
In Catalonia, all entertainment has been put on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona where infections are increasing.
Other European countries have also taken action because of the increase in infections in Spain, but in the UK, everyone has to be admitted when coming home from Spain, as in Norway, and France has been warned against travel to Spain.
Smitum is also growing again in France and Germany, where the government is trying to find a balance to stop the spread of the virus and bring economic life back on track.
The situation in Europe, however, is good compared to elsewhere in the world, but the prevalence of infections worldwide is approaching 300,000 per day, with the highest number of infections in America and South Asia.
According to Johns Hopkins University, there have been 16 million confirmed infections worldwide, and 644,000 confirmed deaths related to the virus.
Mosaic Works Can Finally Be Enjoyed to the Fullest
In front of the Customs House in Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k is a large and deep hole.
Above it are men with orange helmets.
There is also a large grave.
And more smaller work machines.
The road is closed for traffic.
But the walkway is capable, and many are now stalling and revering artwork from millions of mosaic tiles —as if they had never seen it before.
Maybe they’ve never seen it before.
At least I didn’t feel it.
The work has so far been somewhat hidden, right in front of there were parking lots that were always surrounded.
People put it there, locked the car in a hurry and then jumped off to take care of their errands in the city center.
“Living and diverse public spaces” and “attractive urban spaces” are the guiding principles for the reconstruction of the Safe Street that is currently underway.
The goal is to beautify the area and allow the mosaic work done by Helgad<0xC3><0xB3>ttur at the Customs House to enjoy the view better.
In front of the work will be a square and since the area is well located in the sun it is considered well suited as a residential area for travelers.
The artwork will be illuminated and will now enjoy the material better than before on these 142 square meters.
In the area there will also be small "mists", some kind of water sculptures, which offer a game and provide the area with some secrecy.
In this way, the restorations are described by Reykjavik City which is being implemented together with Veitum.
Low water supply, heat supply and power supply will be renewed.
Many of them have come to their years, but the sewerage and cold water supply are from 1925 and have therefore served residents and businesses in the city center for almost a century.
Once the road is reopened, the cars will be able to drive around it again.
But it will still be homogeneous and at the same time create a calmer and more accessible space for walkers.
In an excerpt about the Customs House on the website of the customs officer, it says that the house was commissioned in 1971 and its architect was G<0xC3><0xAD>sli Halld<0xC3><0xB3>rsson.
Because the harbour damage reached through the house there formed 250 square meters of windowless wall tiles out to the street.
The building committee and the architect agreed that such flats would have a bad effect on the overall streetscape, if special measures were not taken to decorate the appearance of the house.
The parties therefore agreed to calculate by having a permanent work of art installed there.
During this time, a lot of words were spoken by Made by Helgad<0xC3><0xB3>ttur, an artist, says in the summary.
She had worked extensively on mosaic artworks in Germany and elsewhere.
The decision was to contact her for the first time before deciding whether to submit to a competition for the work.
It had often been said that the work needed to reflect the life at the port, since the port had been biogenic in Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k since it was made.
When she spoke to the artist, she became so enthralled by such work.
It had to be agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before she left the country, where she would work on the proposals abroad.
Dourd got the time she decided she needed, and when she returned home, she made a few suggestions for discussion.
It was agreed immediately to ask her to do the work.
It was also requested to enter into an overall agreement with her and the famous German art company, the Oidtmann Brothers, but Ger<0xC3><0xB0>ur had long worked with them on the installation of famous works of art throughout Europe.
Contracts were made and Ger<0xC3><0xB0>ur won the artwork during the installation at the workshop of their brothers, who then took care of the installation at the Customs House.
All the work was exceptionally well done by hand, both by Ge<0xC3><0xB0>ar Helgad<0xC3><0xB3>ttur and by Oidtmannbr<0xC3><0xB8>der, says the summary.
Since then, it has endured unfavorable weather conditions in Iceland.
It took about two years to work on the work, which was worked on and set up in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the tollhouse work was completed, only 47 years old.
Preparing for the transfer of more institutions to the land
<0xC3><0x81>smundur Einar Da<0xC3><0xB0>ason, the Minister of Social Affairs, announces that more public institutions will be transferred to the country in the future.
This was stated by the Minister in the episode Explosive on the Wave in the afternoon.
Recently, it was announced that the H<0xC3><0xBA>sn<0xC3><0xA6><0xC3><0xB0>is- og infrastrukturasv<0xC3><0xA5>gansv<0xC3><0xA5>g will be moved north to Sau<0xC3><0xB0><0xC3><0xA1>rkr<0xC3><0xB3>k in the autumn.
Six experts in the field of firefighting work at the institution, but none of them intend to follow the institution north and the National Association of Firefighters and Sick Transporters has criticized the housing transfers.
“I think we need to take a step further in that direction.
I’m preparing for another step in this journey.
"Further transport," said Asmundur.
He says he is convinced that the vast majority of the people want to see more distribution of public institutions around the country.
"I think it is necessary to make more political decisions about the transfer of the public sector to the country, as I did with the Housing and Infrastructure Agency," said <0xC3><0x81>smundur, but he also took an example of other institutions that have been exported to the country, exported to the country and exchanged a large amount of money.
All the best from the second day of the championship
94. The Icelandic Championships in freestyle sports ended today at <0xC3><0x9E><0xC3><0xB3>rsvell in Akureyri.
A number of protests were staged on the second day of the race.
An exciting competition was expected in <0xC3><0x9E><0xC3><0xB3>rsvell’s most successful women’s event, but Vigd<0xC3><0xAD>s J<0xC3><0xB3>nsd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir from FH placed <0xC3><0x8D>slandsmet in the <0xC3><0x8D>slandsmet’s most successful event in 2014 which lasted until Elisabet Rut R<0xC3><0xBA>narsd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir from <0xC3><0x8D>R improved the assessment in May last year.
Vigd<0xC3><0xAD>s returned to <0xC3><0x8D>slandsmet early this summer and has been in fantasy form lately, but she has cleaned <0xC3><0x8D>slandsmet what is summer.
Elizabeth Ruth has been struggling with an injury and did not reach a stroke today.
She had only one valid throw of five, threw 25.69 meters, which is far from her best.
Vigd<0xC3><0xAD>s threw the longest of them all today, or 60.08 meters in her last attempt and put up a counter-estimate at the same time.
Her Icelandic estimate she set earlier in July is 62.69 meters and she was therefore somewhat out of it.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>r<0xC3><0xBA>n Kar<0xC3><0xAD>tas Hallgr<0xC3><0xAD>msd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir from Ireland had the second best throw of the day, but she improved her best result with throwing up to 50.18 meters.
In the men's category, the FH player Hilmar <0xC3><0x96>rn J<0xC3><0xB3>nsson, Icelandic champion in the knockout, won a safe victory but he threw 73.84 meters in his next last throw and set a counter score.
His Icelandic rating in the article is 75.26 meters.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>ni Valur Gu<0xC3><0xB0>nason, Olympic champion and Icelandic runner-up in the round, won a ball game at Thorsvell yesterday but today he competed in the round that is his main article.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>na Vals’s Icelandic score is 65.53 meters but he threw the longest 59.13 meters today and secured the victory.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson pitched the second last day, but he had a valid pitch that fit in the 2nd place, 49.43 meters.
Hafd<0xC3><0xAD>s Sigur<0xC3><0xB0>ard<0xC3><0xB3>ttir, Icelandic long jumper, won the long jump race with superiority, but Hafd<0xC3><0xAD>s jumped the longest 6.25 meters today, which is almost 40 cm from her <0xC3><0x8D>slandsmeti.
In the women’s 200-metre run, it was the <0xC3><0x8D>R-ringer Gu<0xC3><0xB0>björg J<0xC3><0xB3>na Bjarnad<0xC3><0xB3>ttir who was the fastest, but she scored in 24.04 seconds, while her Icelandic score in the article is 23.45 seconds.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>björg J<0xC3><0xB3>na was a winner at Akureyri but she won two gold medals yesterday, in the 100-meter race and in the 4 x 100-meter race and then also in the 4 x 400-meter race today.
In the men's category, Kolbeinn Hö<0xC3><0xB0>ur Gunnarsson from FH was first in the 200-meter run in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of <0xC3><0x93>liver M<0xC3><0xA1>na Samuelsson from <0xC3><0x81>rmann.
Like Gu<0xC3><0xB0>björg J<0xC3><0xB3>na, Kolbeinn Hödur won gold in the 100 metres yesterday as well as in the 400 metres race.
Don’t get a penalty for 27 million kroner Bitcoin harvest
The Supercommittee on Taxation has rejected a tax investigation director’s claim that a person has been fined for misappropriating his financial income that was incurred due to the sale of the bitcoin.
The committee concludes that the director of the tax investigation did not provide a clear justification for why it was necessary to penalize the person.
The committee’s ruling states that the director of the tax investigation considered the person to have received materially incorrect tax returns for the income years 2016 and 2017.
He would have disproportionately overstated his funds that had been generated due to the sale of the Bitcoin electric coin up to 27 million, either intentionally or by great mercilessness.
Punish the man for his superiority.
The man rejected it in a letter to the committee.
However, in 2016, he sold an electric coin for $27 million.
He would have acquired it with a funeral in 2009 and 2010 when it would have been both easy and priceless with a regular home computer.
He then pointed out that when he sold the electric coins, the tax implementation due to such a sale had been significantly unclear and unpredictable.
The worst thing would have been expected for the general public to understand such measures on tax incentives.
He would not have intended to avoid paying tax on the crop and would have recognised his assets on a deposit in a currency account.
He would have asked both the experts and the head of state’s tax department how this would have been done, but without success.
At the time, he felt that he needed to take into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he began digging for Bitcoin.
He would therefore have been in a worse position than others to introduce complex rules that the tax authorities would not have formed a clear opinion of.
The man was therefore right that his taxes for these two years of income would be recalculated and burden imposed but otherwise not punished.
Then he stressed that he worked in Iceland and had paid taxes here in the country since 2012.
He never intended to break free from his obligations in a disrespectful way.
The demand for a fine would be out of the ordinary and would put him in debt.
Brynjolfer: “This man understands what football is”
Brynj<0xC3><0xB3>lfur Andersen Willumsson has been considerably between the teeth of the people but also aroused adoration because of his progress of what is of playtime with Brei<0xC3><0xB0>ablik in the Pepsi Max division.
Blikar will be in the fire line tonight when they receive IA in a live broadcast on Station 2 Sport.
Brynjolfur then removes the play ban because of four reminders during the playtime and therefore does not appear to play with a new cut as in the games of the summer so far.
He had written "blah, blah, blah" on his head for the game at HK last Thursday, which HK won 1–0.
"I don't know who exactly he was responding to with the payment, but talking about the character then, this was better to try in the game.
He did not hide.
He wants to get the ball every single time and if there was anyone going to equalize this game then I thought he would do it or create it," said Gu<0xC3><0xB0>mundur Benediktsson in the Pepsi Max doll, when thought to have hit Brynj<0xC3><0xB3>lfi.
“I’m here for the people.”
“Sometimes it’s hard to know where he is.
He looks a little out on the left when it comes to feeling the games, but he has a very free role in the team," said Hjörvar Haflidason.
Thorkell M<0xC3><0xA1>ni Pétursson says Brynj<0xC3><0xB3>lf is a real entertainer and is delighted to have such a colourful person in the division: “No one shares the fact that this is a character.
This is a fun guy and I love this with my hair, and always be ready to meet and answer in interviews.
There’s an incredible amount of people involved with him, who tells me that this man understands what football is about.
“I am an entertainer.
I want to be there for the people and enjoy it.”
People are reading the interviews with Brynj<0xC3><0xB3>lf, people are paying their own money and watching what happens next on his hair.
“He’s just a genius,” he said.
The player says he wants to leave the club - "I have been in contact with several teams in the B-League"
Tobias Thomsen, a KR player in the Pepsi Max team, seems to be leaving the team.
According to the Danish media Bold, Tobias is ready to return home to Denmark.
F<0xC3><0xB3>tbolti.net also reported the matter.
Tobias wants to reach the start of the season in his home country, but to do so, he first has to cancel his contract with KR, where the Danish team starts before the Icelandic chances.
The company knows that I miss Denmark and has shown me a lot of understanding," Tobias said in a conversation with Bold.
“I have been in contact with some teams in the B-League and will probably switch before the Icelandic season ends.
There are not many teams in Denmark that can afford to pay off my contract with KR."
He then said that he would most likely have to accept a wage cut in Denmark.
“Companies in Denmark have probably found more of the economic impact of the virus than in Iceland.”
The bike whistle Bjartmar has recovered a bike for millions - Now responds to its own after the review DV
For over a year, Bjartmar Le<0xC3><0xB3>sson has had an interest unlike most others.
He snatches up and saves lost and stolen bicycles, electric bikes and scooters.
Bjartmar has earned the name “The Bicycle Whisperer” before.
Yesterday there was a considerable spring fog when a man published a account of his interactions with Bjartmar.
DV then pointed out in a discussion on Facebook group Vesturb<0xC3><0xA6>inga where it was stated that Bjartmar took the man to a speech at Austurvella and said the password may have been stolen.
It was not possible to read from the original writings of the electrician except that Bjartmar had robbed him.
Those texts have now been edited on Facebook and the headline of the original news DV updated accordingly.
Bjartmar says the initial news of the matter is not at all descriptive of what really happened yesterday at Austurvell.
Bjartmar said he had received information from the victim of the electric shock charge that it was indeed his electric shock.
That information was received by the alleged owner from others, but the information turned out to be wrong, says Bjartmar.
“I looked at the guy and I looked at the shuttle, end with information that there was an electric shuttle that had been missing for a very long time and had been searched for.
I hesitated at first, but when I saw him getting ready to go on the scooter, I decided to talk to the man.
The owner was sure of his fault and I decided to have a conversation with the man.
In general, I go very well in such matters, but before I could finish what I had to say, the man had taken away my word."
Bjartmar says that the man on the electric scooter had just asked him to show him the receipt for the bike and called the police himself.
“Yes, great,” said Bjartmar, “let’s just get this straight.”
So, the owner of the electric circuit proved ownership of his electric circuit and proceeded.
Later, the rightful owner of the electric bill said of his story on Facebook, as reported in the previous news.
In this long year that Bjartmar has spent time on this practice, he says he can count the shifts he landed on the edge with people on the other hand.
“I’ve had a peaceful relationship with the hardest people in Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k,” Bjartmar said, pointing out that bicycle thieves are mostly the youngest brothers and sisters of the community, criminals, mentally ill people and other people who are on the street for some reason.
“Fiction is a tough master and somehow the next dose needs to be financed, because unfortunately the theft of such free funds is an easy way to achieve that goal,” says Bjartmar.
“My interaction with these people is really so good that I’ve brought a lot of good people with me on the team.
Examples are that people have gone to treatment and taken care of themselves and then looked to me and helped me with what I’m doing,” he says.
In general, Bjartmar's communication with cyclists is on courteous notes.
Some know of him and what he is doing and offer peacefully to show him receipts, serial numbers of bikes and so on.
Bicycle theft is a big problem that has been little discussed.
In addition, Bjartmar says that the police are more or less telling people to talk to him out of stolen bicycles.
Bjartmar disapproves of DV's previous news report and claims that he is not a self-organized policeman in a personal search for justice.
Asked if he has not yet come to terms with his activity, and whether this is not primarily the role of the police, Bjartmar says so certainly is.
“Of course the police should do this, but the fact of the matter is that the police are not doing this.
I have to imagine the policemen driving away from a huge pile of stolen bikes.
She is clearly said to be powerless in these matters.”
“When the police are not doing anything about this, and it’s just in front of your nose, and experience has shown that I can succeed in this group of cases, why not?” Bjartmar asks.
He claims to have achieved so much success in having stolen bikes, that sometimes he meets his “shelters” on the street that then they were just right the brighter bikes they had previously gotten themselves in.
The times Bjartmar has called for help from the police have made it clear that she will not be present.
“It’s just not working with the police, and it’s not my fault, and it’s not the owners of the bicycles,” Bjartmar said, adding that he was sorry that the victims of the bicycle theft needed to feel the police’s vanity in this category.
Bjartmar's performance is not shared.
There are many stories of people thanking Bjartmai for having brought their property back to them.
Bjartmar himself says that he has long lost the number of bicycles he has returned, but the amounts, of course, run in the millions, if not millions.
Electric scooters, electric bikes and electric scooters weigh heavily, but electric bikes can cost up to half a million.
Bjartmar works every day in kindergarten and every other weekend he works in a house.
His bike ride is therefore unpaid work that he does in his spare time.
Life Insurance Funds and Long Shadows
2019 was a big birthday year in the history of Icelandic pension funds.
Officials had supposedly received a pension from the King of Denmark all the streets from the 19th century, but in 1919 the Pension Fund of the officials was established, which eventually became the Pension Fund of all public servants.
The basis for the existing pension funds of general wage earners was then laid by general employment agreements in 1969, which provided for an employment-related pension fund with a compulsory membership and a valid fundraising since the beginning of the year 1970.
In 1974, laws were enacted on the basis of these agreements and the pension system continued to strengthen after that.
The wage-earners' pension system was not the only radical change that the 20th-century labour movement brought about with its camaraderie.
Unemployment insurance had been obtained in a similar way in historic industrial initiatives in 1955, and also the organization gradually got along with its demands on sickness law and health funds, substantial leave rights, reduction of working time, and improvement of housing.
All these rights cost a great and severe struggle, but, to be sure, a far greater and lasting reward than the increase of the auras in the wage union, which disappeared even more steadily in the heat of the price inflation that characterized the post-war period and until 1990 as many remember.
The attraction to the establishment of a general pension fund in 1969 was both long and complex.
Although people eventually agree that the funds would in fact be the property of the fund's partners, the labor movement became convinced that their boards should appoint representatives of employers and fund's partners alike.
In the following years after the foundation of the Funds, the demand for the majority of employees in the management of the Funds was often discussed in employee associations, but it never succeeded, and therefore we are still up with the abnormal arrangement that the representatives of the Funds' companies are not in the majority.
Article 36 of Act No 129/1997 on the compulsory insurance of pension rights and the activities of pension funds deals with the investment policy of the funds.
It states in paragraph 1 that “the pension fund shall be guided by the interests of the fund’s members.”
Section 5 also states: “The Pension Fund shall set a moral standard for itself in investments.”
The share capital of the Merchants' Pension Fund includes, inter alia, the following provisions, in addition to the aforementioned legal provisions:
The Pension Fund is a party to the United Nations (UN PRI) rules on responsible investment, as well as many of the largest pension funds and professional investors in the Western Ocean and in Europe.
The rules discuss how the emphasis on environmental and social issues, as well as good corporate governance, can contribute to an improved return on investment of stock portfolios.
In this way, the interests of investors and the objectives of the society are combined in a wider context.
LV believes that it is important for companies, especially those listed on the stock market, to adopt a public policy: to adopt good governance, social responsibility and environmental issues.
The Social Security Fund Valdi, which has the largest funds in the country, has set up a "Responsible Investment Policy" and there are provisions of a similar nature.
This is all summarized here as an introduction to the latest fashion word of Icelandic, “shadow management”.
Since the word is used in the case, it is not hoped that it has been defined in a nutshell, but the following definition now seems to me to be "most taken": Shadow gas management is when a leader of a corporation states in the media that he intends to send a recommendation to the company's representatives in the management of a pension fund.
If they do not comply with the recommendations, they will be removed from the board at the first opportunity.
If the president does not take this to the media and does not talk about resignation, then it is not "shadow management" because such communication between people is, of course, always in the financial world as elsewhere.
I’m going to let the reader think about how he feels “shadyer.”
There are in particular two people who have tried to formulate this definition when it is written, on the morning of Saturday, July 25, 2020.
They are the reporter at Fr<0xC3><0xA6>ttabla<0xC3><0xB0>in and the bank manager at <0xC3><0x81>sgeir J<0xC3><0xB3>nsson.
The purpose of both came about after Bogi Nils Bogason, Icelandair’s CEO, had announced his intention to enter into the company’s agreements with air traffic controllers and air traffic controllers, and Ragnar <0xC3><0x9E><0xC3><0xB3>r Ing<0xC3><0xB3>lfsson, the chairman of the Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k Commercial Corporation, sent the company’s full
Some time later Bogi Nils withdrew his decision, and thereafter Ragnar Thor went the same way with his recommendations, which of course focused on Boga's decision.
Nevertheless, they saw a reason for Här<0xC3><0xB0>ur and <0xC3><0x81>sgeir to discuss the matter in the Fr<0xC3><0xA6>ttabladen newspaper on Friday with big words about shadow management, lawbreaking and the rich need for changes in the law.
There, indeed, the little squirrel should have turned a heavy load even though the blessed squirrel had been in a restraining position and was also soon wiped out.
Since this is important, let’s consider the subject itself at the end.
I have already mentioned some of the provisions of the Pensions Act that apply to this matter.
These include that fund boards should protect the interests of fund members and have ethical criteria in investments, and these items are elaborated in more detail in the approved both Valdis and the Merchants’ Pension Fund as I mentioned.
Pension funds, on the other hand, should NOT look only at short-term yield perspectives in their investments.
This would be a very dangerous policy, and it is not necessary to look for examples of this in the past, where large loans from banks and funds have flowed to the immoral adventures and environmental problems, with disastrous consequences.
The CEO of Icelandair was obviously on ice when he thought about wiping out a whole group of employees, thus significantly reducing the goodwill that the company has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakening its position towards investors.
Fortunately, he saw it and pulled it back.
Time will reveal whether it is sufficient for the investment of pension funds in the company to be held liable to the fund companies when it is established.

One of the infected did not have a home inspection
One of the three who were diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country arrived in the country from the Baltic States on July 15, about a week and a half ago.
He is an Icelander who, however, does not live here as a standard and therefore did not receive clear instructions to hold a so-called home inspection after arriving in the country and go to another sampling a few days after arrival.
He got a negative from the screening at the border.
“But he’s in Icelandic society and he really has to go to that resort,” says Kamilla J<0xC3><0xB3>sepsd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir, an expert in the field of contraception at Landl<0xC3><0xA6>kni and a deputy contraceptive doctor during his summer vacation, in a conversation with Fr<0xC3><0xA6>ttabladen today.
“He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to register the license plate and if the license plate is not registered then you are not automatically invited to the second sample.”
She says that the man could have used the English registration form because he is actually living abroad but because of his connection to the country as an Icelander he would rather have used it in Icelandic.
However, he did not realize this.
“When the ID is not registered, you have to search for it yourself to come to the second sample.
Neither he nor his employer seem to have realized that this was the right way to go," Kamilla said.
“So it is clear that we need to improve the information on this while we find some way to make an automatic preaching system even though Icelanders do not register their ID number.
Or to make it somewhat more obvious who are the participants in the Icelandic society in the registration system," she explains.
Fortunately, the person concerned does not come to the country, although he is defined as a participant in the Icelandic society, who remains an Icelander.
Only six have been sent into solitary confinement since he was diagnosed yesterday and these six were all in contact with him.
They are due to be sampled, but two of them have begun to show symptoms of Covid-19 infection.
The man received a negative sample from his sample at the border on July 15.
Kamilla is likely to say that he was recently infected with the virus that she had not yet been able to detect him when the sample was taken at the border.
However, she does not want to rule out that the man had been infected here in Iceland but did not bring the virus to the country.
“It is not entirely possible to argue that this is a definitely imported infection because it has been a long time since he came to the country that he may have been exposed here like these two who have caused a bit of a stir in connection with the sporting competition.”
She says it’s very unlikely because of how few people are around here.
“It’s actually very unlikely,” says Kamilla, but points out that it cannot be ruled out until Icelandic genetic analysis has cleared the virus in humans.
“If we get a virus that hasn’t been seen here before, it’s almost certain that he brought it to the country.”
Piperspreys and bombs applied against protesters
There was a clash between police and protesters in Seattle last night.
Police used pepperspray and hand-bombs, but protesters broke windows and lit the fire.
Fifty-five protesters were arrested and 21 police officers were beaten.
Police violence and racial prejudices were protested across the United States last night, but the Seattle protests were in support of protesters in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one protestor was shot to death.
According to the BBC, the attacker has been arrested.
Thousands gathered in Seattle for peaceful protests.
A group of people then set fire to a building area and broke windows in the city’s courthouse.
Subsequently, police said the protests were unresolved and there was a clash between groups of protesters and police.
In Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old black man who was assassinated by police in August last year, was recalled by protesters.
A car drove through a group of protesters in the city, but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of members of the National Guard came together and demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was murdered by police at her home in March.
The group carried firearms and marched in the counties to closed streets where police acquiesced the group from a group of people who objected to the protests and also carried firearms.
There were 75 arrests in Omaha, Nebraska, where protesters recalled James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man who was murdered by a white bartender in May.
“It’s not the game that defines our season.
Ole Gunnar Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r, manager of Manchester United, does not want to make too much of the importance of the game against Leicester today in the final round of the English Premier League.
If United loses the game, and Chelsea does not lose to the Wolves, Solskjaer and his men end up in 5th place and lose to the Champions League.
However, they should still hope to make it to the Champions League by winning the European Cup next month.
“We haven’t reached the finish line.
If we get to a point against Leicester I think people will say that we have not had a bad season now," Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r said.
“Whatever happens, this is not the end of our journey because we still have a lot of time to catch the two teams ahead of us,” Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r said.
It is clear that people’s nerves will be there at 3 p.m. today, but Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r tried to pretend that every other game was about.
“If you want to belong to Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season.
It’s not new, and that’s what the company is based on.
We have created a great opportunity to finish the season well and now it is up to us to take advantage of it," Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r said.
“It’s not the most important game of the season, it’s just the next game.
You can ask anyone in football, the next game is always the most important.
The results do not define our period, we have already had many times to define this period."
“Come Bruno Fernandes has changed a lot for us and I think we are in better shape and much stronger mentally than in the last season,” Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r said.
65,000 infections per day
A total of 65,490 new coronavirus infections were detected in the United States yesterday, according to John Hopkins University.
A total of 4,178,021 infections have been confirmed in the Western Ocean since the beginning of the epidemic in that country.
900 died of the virus yesterday, but in the last four days there were more than 1,000 deaths per day due to the virus.
A total of 146,460 deaths due to the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
According to a prediction by the U.S. Department of Defense, the death toll from the virus will rise to 175,000 on August 15, according to CNN.
Fear of the second wave of the epidemic
The government of Spain is now struggling to contain the increase in the spread of COVID-19 in the country.
Spanish health authorities reported more than 920 new cases of COVID-19, both on Thursday and Friday.
Since the beginning of May, no more people have been identified in a single day and the debris is coming at the same time that the Spanish are beginning to unleash one of the strictest exit bans in Europe.
The reverse led to the British authorities now obliging passengers coming from Spain to lodge a complaint upon their return.
A week ago, Spain was on the UK’s list of safe countries.
The situation is at its worst in Catalonia in the northeast of Spain, where the government has resorted to broader restrictions to try to adjust the level to the rate of growth.
In the capital city of Barcelona, entertainment venues will be closed for the next two weeks and pubs will be closed at midnight.
The ban now applies to 200,000 people in Segria County, in the western part of Catalonia.
It is believed that the decision of the UK will have a negative impact on the Spanish economy, which relies heavily on the arrival of foreign tourists and is a bad game after the epidemic.
Tui, the UK’s largest travel agency, canceled all scheduled flights to Spain and the Canary Islands.
Governments around the world are said to be preparing for the second wave of the pandemic, but little interest seems to be in retracing the extensive exit ban that has largely devastated the economy.
Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, has taken a very bad look at such things as nuclear weapons that he does not want to use.
Then, Jean Castex, the Prime Minister of France, has said that the nation "would not recover from life, economically or socially," if again taken to the expulsion ban on a national level.
Many councillors hope that a local resource that reaches the inhabitants of individual towns, cities or regions will be sufficient to hold back the virus in the next round if it comes.
Five new infections in Iceland - Three inland
Three inland crossings were detected yesterday and two more at the border.
Five people with a positive Covid-19 infection were diagnosed in Iceland yesterday.
In a press release, the public said one infection was related to the infection that was reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football tournament.
He has been sent in isolation and sixteen who were in close contact with him in abeyance.
The infected person was a participant in the social work of the sports association in Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k and is, according to the announcement, "only part of the sporting team" in the fallout.
Others who have been sent have been in contact with the man in a different way.
The origin of this infection is undetectable and the contagion is in full swing with the contagion team of the Director of State Police.
ReyCUP’s recipients have followed the guidelines and rules of the GP and the general practitioners that are still in force and have taken appropriate measures.
However, yesterday's photos of the tournament attracted attention, as they were able to see in very close communication to celebrate the good pace of their team on the field.
Just before 11 a.m. today, the recipients posted the following message on their Facebook page.
It says, “ATH: Parents please respect the rules that competitors bring their own daughter to school.
Parents are not allowed to do that.
Thank you for your understanding.”
Another infection was detected yesterday, but is related to the infection reported yesterday.
According to the report: “The Icelandic genetic analysis has identified the infection and has revealed a new type of virus that has not been detected here before.”
Contamination in this case is also carried out and the infected person is isolated and 12 is in solitary confinement because of the infection.
The third case is from a man who arrived in Iceland 11 days ago, on 15 July.
It was located in the southwest corner of the country.
He is now in solitary confinement and six who were in close contact with him in solitary confinement.
Two of them are already showing signs of viral infection.
In addition, two persons were identified at the border and the outcome of further research is awaited, such as work on border infections.
Finally, the announcement states: The Public Health Department of the Chief of State Police and the office of the GP urge people to be careful and consider the individual contagious agents.
Games have the slightest doubt about whether the symptoms of the Covid-19 virus are present, the same person is asked to go for a sampling at the next health center.
Patreksfjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur says the camping area booked for a shopping weekend - Directs guests another
The tent site in Patreksfjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur is fully booked on weekends, according to the announcement of Vesturbyg<0xC3><0xB0>ur.
If you're looking for a place to stay, check out other options.
Names Vesturbygg<0xC3><0xB0> Bildudal, T<0xC3><0xA1>lknafjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur, Melanes <0xC3><0xA1> Raudasand, H<0xC3><0xB3>tel Fl<0xC3><0xB3>kalund and H<0xC3><0xB3>tel Brei<0xC3><0xB0>av<0xC3><0xAD>k as other options in the position.
It is enough to be on Patreksfjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur this weekend, because, as in previous years, Skjaldborg, a festival of Icelandic authors will be held in the city.
It has been held since 2007 and has become a strong tradition in the city.
By the application in the camp site to be judged, one can expect a good attendance this year, if the weather does not put a strike in the account, but DV earlier today said of the final prediction.
However, we can expect the worst weather in the south, and hope for Patreksfir<0xC3><0xB0>ig.
The website bb.is first reported, and said that all other accommodations in the town were already fully booked.
Whole mansion caves down to the best place in town
Romanian workers live free at Dunhaga 18–20.
In the meantime, owners apply for building permits for renovations, but their work has flourished in the system for the third year.
In one of the oldest, greenest and most expensive districts of Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k city, there is a large apartment building on three floors.
On the ground floor of the house is about 600 square meters of shopping area.
Behind the house there are two staircase doors that each contain four rather spacious apartments.
They range from 93 to 130 square meters, though most are over 100.
The house has a lot of history to hide.
It was built in 1959 and has hosted video rentals, Sk<0xC3><0xB3>stofina, Milk Shop of the Milk Market, J<0xC3><0xB3>a Gunsusmi, fish market and now the last University Press.
The house has, as soft as it sounds, remembered its fiendish beauty.
The house is now under heavy damage, as can be seen in the accompanying pictures.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
The owners of D18 ehf. are according to the company register, among others, Magn<0xC3><0xBA>s Magn<0xC3><0xBA>sson and Gu<0xC3><0xB0>r<0xC3><0xBA>n Helga L<0xC3><0xA1>rusd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir.
Magn<0xC3><0xBA>s went for the owner group of Borgunar and was a defender of the ownership company of Borgunar.
In the group of owners of the ownership company Borgunar, St<0xC3><0xA1>lskip ehf.
St<0xC3><0xA1>lskip ehf. is the investment company of Gu<0xC3><0xB0>r<0xC3><0xBA>nar Helga L<0xC3><0xA1>rusd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir and her children.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>r<0xC3><0xBA>n is also the owner of a third stake in D18 ehf.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>r<0xC3><0xBA>n and her husband, <0xC3><0x81>g<0xC3><0xBA>st Gu<0xC3><0xB0>mundur Sigur<0xC3><0xB0>sson, once built the Steel Ship.
D18 ehf. bought the house in the summer of 2009 and has therefore little that has not been kept since then.
Tell the neighbors that the condition of the house has steadily deteriorated since, although most in recent years.
A local resident said on his Facebook page that the house had “not been particularly lively in the last few years.”
There may be a play in which the owners have about a few years left after changing the house and the lot.
Other neighbors say the house has not been well for a long time.
“It’s been a long time to do something kind with this stain and it’s boring that it’s been dragging on like this.”
He also says that he is a fool to the owners of the house for not having dared to finish this, find some common ground with the neighbors of the house and stop this "legal stick".
“Just do this in consultation with the community around you so that you can move on and finish it.”
The "legal step" to which the resident refers is the organizational process of the field that has been underway at least since 2017.
The owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 then agreed to build a floor on top of the current mansion and in front of the house, a new elevator and a one-floor extension as well as basements.
The building permit granted for that implementation was appealed to the Committee on the Environment and Resources Decisions and removed it from the Committee as the implementation did not have a subdivisional structure and a thorough notification was not sufficient.
Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k city then started with divisional planning work and ended it with an announcement in the Government Newspapers in July last year.
That arrangement was also cherished and the committee repealed it in March 2020.
At this point, it was almost three years since the initial application for a building permit and the owners of the house were in the process of getting started.
By this time, the house had fallen down considerably and the neighbors were getting tired.
When DV asked the neighbors of the house about the situation and the reaction of the neighbors, the answers were in various ways.
Some of them understood the intentions of the owners of the house, others did not.
Some people were angry with the city, others were not.
They were angry, but not necessarily angry at anyone.
Still others said the parking lot was troublesome, but neighbors have used the unused Dunhaga 18-20 parking lot under their vehicles.
One of the complainants in the case said tired of the administration:
“The fact that we have to go through the process three times is absolutely incredible.
“It’s like the city of Reykjavik can’t read.”
Today the house is empty, abandoned and neglected.
Memoirs of the city’s sublime administration and the noble intentions of the owners and the many years of their work that is now in its infancy.
When a reporter was in the garden at Dunhaga 18, we blew open doors and garbage cans.
Playstation PCs and recent TVs lay within another rubbish dump on Earth — victims of Icelandic summer blues.
It was opened in the old office of the University of Applied Sciences, and there were a lot of cats of the smell to judge.
It is clear that someone has cleaned himself in one corner but no one is visible.
Stacks of sofas and beds and a few boards of geological journals, which were probably to become a book, blew us away.
The staircases of the apartment were also open and there was life in both.
A journalist was so lucky to shoot at another’s inhabitants.
There the Romanians cooked a potato dish for dinner and invited a journalist in.
The Romanians work for the employees of Zstrongforce ehf.
They have been there for some time and impersonate DV sources that the company has paid nothing for the housekeeping except heat and electricity.
Due to the condition of the house, it is not advisable to collect the rent.
From the post office in the front door of the house to judge it is clear that there have been a lot of foreign workers on the last losses.
Operational staff rentals have not been a minor part of the Covid-19 situation, since contracting in tourism has led to contracting in the construction sector and these two industries have been the most efficient to use the services of staff rentals.
Nevertheless, the locals at Dunhaga 18 seemed to have plenty to do and the work streets and plazas in the community hung to dry after a long day of work in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the terrible condition of the house, the apartment that the boys shared seemed to be well maintained.
When a journalist squatted the Romanian boys, he suddenly became aware of the idiom: In the best place in Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k, there is 1,500 square meters of real estate downgraded.
Owners want to change the house for the better and neighbors want to improve the situation but share the definition of "bath".
In the meantime, the city’s planning area sits on the starting line, victims of endless appeals and sympathy opportunities in the planning process, and the final decision of the Committee on Environmental and Resource Issues.
In the house there are so many Romanian workers, perhaps precisely those who are going to improve the situation, when the Icelanders cease to fight.
The article was originally published in the weekly newspaper DV on July 17.
In the fight against overweight following the Coronavirus age
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will provide <0xC2><0xA3>10 million in an anti-obesity campaign, which will, among other things, be banned from quick-biting ads, as a result of he becoming seriously ill, in part because of his weight.
Johnson is due to unveil the campaign, which has been dubbed Better Health, tomorrow, Monday, but with the campaign, doctors will be encouraged to prescribe bicycles for their overweight shelters and will also be attacked in support of the increase in cycling walks.
Then, advertisements of emergency food restaurants on television will be banned before 9 p.m. in the evening, according to British media sources.
“COVID-19 has awakened us to the short- and long-term risks of being overweight, and the Prime Minister is determined that we must use time to become healthier, more active and eat healthier diets,” a government spokesman said.
Johnson himself has been dealing with weight problems to fight, but he was put on parole when he contracted the coronavirus in the spring, and it is in part to his weight because he is believed to have fallen so seriously.
It’s better for women to make the changes.
She said that the new constitution is the biggest step that the nation can take towards greater power distribution, transparency and in the fight against corruption and the interests of the whole.
“We need to change gears a little bit now and who better to lead such changes than the group of society that should be easier to be in these values.
“There are women,” said Helga.
“Women in Iceland are famous for their gender identity.
To stand together and be together in leading change.
So now it’s just up to us to make those changes.”
She said she was a little outraged by the focus on Iceland as “the best in the world” in both gender equality and human rights.
“We’re not ready to see what needs to be done.
Like the Germans are very aware of their history and look at everything that needs to be done.
That's a lot.
We need to know where we are coming from and know the story and listen.
Listen to the voices of other groups.
We don’t all have the same rules here,” said Helga.
In response, she said that women are in many ways in good shape in Iceland, but added that, as in many other places, Icelanders were building at a very low masculine level.
She said that politics revolves around the formation of self-interest, sovereignty and power that are the forces that uphold injustice in all societies.
“Women have now formed this group and are coming together and are just getting a little bit annoyed that the parliament is going to move in a move to look past this 2012 referendum,” she said.
“It’s the feminine values that we’re thinking of.
From the point of view of human rights and the protection of nature, cooperation and that we are all really at the same table," she said, adding that the aforementioned values were the basic values of the new constitution.
“We are a very rich country of natural resources and it is ridiculous that there are people living in poverty.
It’s ridiculous, we can change things differently,” said Helga.
“It’s ridiculous that it’s a natural law that women’s jobs are always lower paid.
It’s ridiculous that pilots and nurses need to be in a janitor’s fight forever just to get a decent wage.”
The signature list for the new governmental register can be signed here through electronic Iceland.
Attempted to rob a pedestrian in the city centre
A man was arrested in the city centre last night after he threatened pedestrians and tried to get money from him.
The police also stopped the production of drugs in <0xC3><0x81>rb<0xC3><0xA6> where two were arrested for the case.
The police then stopped the driver of a motorcycle in Hl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC3><0xB0>in where the driver was at a speed of 146 km where the maximum speed is 60 km/h.
In addition, he had previously been deprived of driving licences.
Police in the capital area had enough to turn around last night and there were more than 80 cases recorded in the police diary from five yesterday to five this morning.
There was a lot of noise due to the noise.
On Saturday night, there were reports of eleven noisy gatherings and it was widely reported in the police diary.
Last night, however, 22 noise incidents broke out at the police station.
Six were kept in a prison cell last night.
Police were called at night when the planes were fired into the air.
However, they had already escaped when police officers were at the park.
At that time, nine drivers were stopped for drunkenness and or drug addiction.
Four people were arrested for fighting in the city centre last night, one of whom was kept in a prison cell.
Then two were transferred to an emergency room after they fell on their faces, one in the city center and the other in the West City.
One was transferred to an accident department after he was injured while jumping on a trampoline in Kopavogur.
In addition, police officers stopped the driver who pulled a caravan at Kjalarnes yesterday.
The vehicle was, according to a police log, in "very bad condition" and was stationary.
You can stay at the Monet House on the weekend of shopping
The house, in which Impressionist Claude Monet spent the last forty years of his life, is now available for rent on the Airbnb site.
The next free nights in the house are about the shopping weekend.
The house is small and cobbled, located in the town of Givenry in Normandy in France.
The painter lived in the house from 1883 until his death in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two sitting rooms and three bathrooms.
Monet first got inspired to paint his gardens famous in this house.
If you plan to rent the house, you must rent it for at least two nights.
Based on Airbnb, it’s free next week, on Sunday, so it might be ideal for some shoppers on holiday to rush into booking the painter’s house.
The two nights over a shopping weekend cost only 964 U.S. dollars or just over 130 thousand Icelandic kroner after the Newspaper arrives next.
Dozens in diarrhea and several of them begin to show symptoms of the disease caused by the coronavirus
Five have been diagnosed with the coronavirus at home in the last three days and are most of the infected unrelated.
Dozens of people have become ill because of this, and several of them begin to show symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three were diagnosed with the Coronavirus at home yesterday and two at the border screening.
A specialist in the field of veterinary medicine says that the growing number of domestic infections does not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading far into the community.
“It’s been sorted out from the last domestic meeting and it’s a virus that hasn’t been seen here before so we don’t have any particular reason to think it’s been hidden in society for some time.
This is probably something that has recently come to the country, but of course we need to be very careful now," said Kamilla Sigr<0xC3><0xAD><0xC3><0xB0>ur J<0xC3><0xB3>sefsd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir, an expert in the field of epidemiology of the official local doctor.
Most of those infected have been in contact with individuals who came from abroad.
Further samplings are carried out in the future than some, who were in contact with those infected have begun to show the symptoms of the coronavirus.
“Now there is no flu going on and less about other respiratory tract infections so we can be quite free to do this test on individuals who at the time of the flu would have found a reason to do something else first,” Kamilla said.
The treatment is mostly completed, but it is not excluded that more need to go to the hospital.
Two of the infected people were identified after attending a sports event.
It raises questions as to whether it is appropriate to hold such an event.
The director of public relations says it well as long as people follow the criteria and rules.
Kamilla says she almost ruled out that the infected people had been infected at the sports tournaments.
“If there is no more isolation from these individuals after having interacted with them at these sporting events, then we can maintain that our anti-abortion measures at the events have worked.
“It’s not going to happen,” Kamilla said.
The work of the Department of Public Safety is under constant review.
“We need to be prepared to intervene with further advice or restrictions if it seems appropriate,” Kamilla said.
A week later, the number of people in the country will be reduced to a thousand.
This new position could have an effect on the constraints.
"Determined Thinking to Cook" - See the menu of El<0xC3><0xAD>sa Vi<0xC3><0xB0>ar
El<0xC3><0xAD>sa Vi<0xC3><0xB0>arsd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir is a professional footballer who plays with Val.
She is also a master's student in nutrition, a mother, and works as a food scientist.
She needs a lot of energy for the beat of the day and usually gives herself time to cook good and nutritious food.
My normal day at work starts at 8:00 a.m.," says El<0xC3><0xAD>sa.
“After work, I go to the store to prepare dinner before I pick up my girl at the kindergarten at three o’clock.”
Elise finds it very nutritious to pick up her daughter early in kindergarten.
“It’s good to have time with her before I go to practice the second part.
After the exercise, it is good to come home and just need to warm up the food.
At night, when the girl is asleep, we like to watch one episode to empty our minds.
Eliza does not follow any particular diet.
She’s putting her final hand on a master’s degree in nutrition and knows what’s right for her to eat to have enough energy to do work, school, family, and exercise.
“What suits me is to eat a variety of foods that are well composed of proteins, carbohydrates and fats.
However, I think the most important thing is to have a healthy relationship with food and not classify food in bad or good, rather nutritious or nutritious.
It’s okay to eat everything, just not all at once and not always.”
Eliza is very interested in cooking.
“I think it’s a bit of a reflection to stand in the kitchen to cook and get a lot into it.
I have to say that self-confidence is with me in the kitchen and I sincerely believe that I am a good cook."
Breakfast: Hafer, chia seeds, hemp seeds, salt, a little lemon juice, leave in almond milk overnight.
Try to make this meal with whatever you have.
Usually it's bananas and sponged musli & coffee.
I'm a big coffee drinker.
Intermediate: Incredibly mismatched, but fruit or vegetables, flat cakes, clean shrimp with bananas and muslin, bread with pasta and so I could eat hummus with a spoon up out of a box if applicable.
Lunch Meal: I often eat all kinds of delicious salads from what’s in the fridge, quinoa or barley, falafel bowls, rock salad, baked vegetables with a good dressing is a bit of what I’m working on.
If the arrangement goes completely out of bounds (which happens often) then the egg maker at work has brought me quite often to the rescue and then there are 2 slices of bread with butter, cheese and boiled eggs, don't put more on you.
Pros: Get me something rich in carbohydrate for exercise, bread with appetizers, breakfast cereal or fruit.
Dinner: Fish will be very often for the choice of my home, otherwise some delicious vegetable dishes.
Conflict Between Police and Protesters in Seattle
The city of Seattle, Washington, has declared a state of insurrection in the aftermath of mass protests in the city.
Yesterday, police raided a bomb and a pipe roof to try to tear down a large area under which protesters were holding their ground and stretched over many streets in the vicinity of the city’s parliament building.
Police announced on Twitter that at least eleven protesters had been arrested and that an investigation was underway into damage done to a police station in the city yesterday, possibly by some sort of bomb.
City and police authorities say protesters stoned police with stones, bottles, shells and other loose stones and one policeman was taken to a hospital where he was injured.
The protests in Seattle, however, were peaceful for a long time.
The blue was for them to show the protesters in Portland, Oregon, solidarity, but in the city has repeatedly led to fierce clashes between protesters and heavily armed federal police.
There, as in many U.S. cities, people gather under the banner of Black Lives Matter, recalls Georges Floyds, who was killed by a Minneapolis police officer on May 25, protesting systemic racism in American society and demanding redress.
Not withdrawn until after the vote has been taken.
It is not yet clear whether their cancellations of Icelandair, which are due to take effect in the next month's meeting, will be revoked.
Icelandair’s electronic voting on the Icelandic Air Force’s charter agreement on behalf of air carriers will end at noon tomorrow.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>laug L<0xC3><0xAD>ney J<0xC3><0xB3>hannsd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir, the company’s chairman, is confident that Icelandair will not take a decision on the terminations until the outcome of the vote is available.
"It's very close," said Gudlaug L<0xC3><0xAD>ney.
“There have been no cancellations, this has to be done so that the machines can be manned.
So, of course, people are dissatisfied after getting to know if there will be work after the month-long meeting."
The agreement was signed a week ago, on the eve of July 19.
It is expected to be valid until the end of September 2025 and based on a contract previously entered into by air traffic controllers in a vote.
On July 17, the board and the board of trustees of the Icelandic Air Force approved the announcement of an all-army work stop at Icelandair, which was approved by members in a vote.
It never came to her, but this was decided as a result of Icelandair's decision to suspend negotiations with the airline, terminate all its airline companies and seek agreements with another airline.
Then the pilots of the company should take over the work of the safety team on board temporarily.
Asked how she thinks the voter turnout will go, Gudlaug L<0xC3><0xAD>ney says it’s hard to say.
“People are hurt by this move by Icelandair, when all of the airline’s airlines were terminated and it was announced that there would be an agreement with another airline.
Now it’s clear if it will have an effect,” she said.
At the end of April, 940 flight attendants were employed by Icelandair, of which 900, about 95%, were terminated.
Their termination period is a miscarriage, for those who have the shortest working life it is three months and ends during the month of July-August.
About 90% of Icelandair airlines are in this group.
What will happen if the agreement is not accepted?
“We are looking forward to continuing discussions with our colleagues.
With this agreement, we are meeting the requirements of Icelandair.
If he is rejected, it is clear that the flight attendants seem to have gone too far.”
Icelandair announces the conclusion of the second quarter of the agreement and the conclusion of the second quarter of the year
The vote of the airliner on the new charade agreement will end at 12 noon tomorrow.
Icelandair’s statement for the second quarter will also be published tomorrow, but preliminary surplus results indicate that the company’s revenues have fallen by 85 percent from the same period last year.
The e-vote on the Icelandic Air Transport Association and the Association of Professionals for Icelandair started on Wednesday, July 22, and ends tomorrow, Monday, July 27, at 12 noon.
The employees of Icelandair who are entitled to vote for the contract are employees of Icelandair who pay company fees to the airline.
Icelandair and the FF<0xC3><0x8D> signed a new charter agreement on Sunday, July 19, but on Friday, Icelandair had negotiated with the company after air traffic controllers dropped the previous agreement in a vote in early July.
Then Icelandair had told all the airliners and airliners of the company up on Friday but they were pulled back after a new charter was signed.
According to the new charter agreement, pilots need to fly five more hours a month for the same basic salary.
The agreement will remain in force until 2025, which will include provisions for pilots and flight attendants on how long they can fly on a single watch.
The agreement was presented to members of the FF<0xC3><0x8D> at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica hotel last Monday and described many airlines that the news agency discussed with them about dissatisfaction with the agreement.
However, most people agreed that it would be necessary to accept the agreement to keep the FF<0xC3><0x8D> alive.
Icelandair’s calculations for the second quarter will be presented tomorrow, but the company’s EBIT, its operating income for members and taxes, is negative by 100 to 110 million U.S. dollars or about 15 billion krona, according to preliminary results.
Icelandair sent its interim calculations to the Copenhagen Airport last Wednesday, where it said the company's earnings amounted to about $60 million in the quarter, or about SEK 8.3 billion.
At the end of the quarter, the handheld and its equivalent amounted to about 154 million U.S. dollars, about 21 billion kroner.
Icelandair also plans to offer the company’s share capital in August.
Icelandair aims to finalize contracts with 15 borrowers, the government and the Boeing aircraft manufacturer before the end of the month before it enters into a partial tender.
A new variant rather than a new type of virus
“A new virus just means that this has been an individual who came from abroad.
This is not something that has been painted here at home," says M<0xC3><0xA1>r Kristj<0xC3><0xA1>nsson, a doctor at the infectious disease department of the Landspitalan, about the rumors that "a new type of virus" has been detected here in the country.
Three inland crossings were detected yesterday and two at the border.
One person who was identified had participated in the association's work at the Rey Cup football tournament, but the origin of the infection was not found and the infection remains.
An infection was also detected in a person who arrived in the country on 15 July and two people who were in contact with him began to show symptoms of COVID-19.
Then, yesterday, an infection related to an infection that was reported yesterday was detected and after an analysis by the Icelandic genetic analysis, a “new type of virus that has not been detected here before” was discovered.
The smearing is completed in connection with that infection.
M<0xC3><0xA1>r notes that this is not a new virus, but the same virus that has spread around the world, i.e. the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
It is more appropriate to talk about a new variant of the virus than about a new type of virus.
Asked what it meant and if it could say anything about the beginning of another wave of epidemics, M<0xC3><0xA1>r says that as if it were an isolated incident and it could go so that there will be no more of it.
“However, if there are domestic cases that are not related from abroad and have the same genotype as this particular variant, then that conclusion [of the second wave] could be drawn, but it is untimely for them to support it,” explains M<0xC3><0xA1>r.
Happiness in the Hot Pot
Is the secret to the happiness of the Icelanders hidden in the hot pots?
BBC programmers are leading the way in a fun video that sheds light on the country’s swimming pool and hot tub culture.
The Icelandic bathing culture is unique worldwide and it is stated that nowhere in the world are so many bathing places per capita.
The natural geothermal energy is the basis of it, but also the tradition of swimming that prevails here.
Children’s health education was legalized in 1940, but older citizens are nevertheless able to use their hot water for health.
Snorkeling is described as an integral part of the general well-being of the country.
In the pot, everyone is equal, regardless of position and position.
With mobile phones, people chat on personal notes around the home and store or take advantage of the similar power of water: meditating and charging the batteries of the soul and body.
A hundred days to go in the polls.
There are 100 days until the U.S. goes to the polls and elects a president for four years.
Donald Trump is seeking re-election, but he is still on the run.
Joe Biden, an expected Democratic candidate, has a big lead on Trump nationwide, according to the polls.
According to a recent AP poll, the estimated number of Americans believe the nation is on the wrong track.
Trump’s response to the new coronavirus pandemic is also highly unpopular, with more Americans considering Trump’s handling of economic issues more unpopular than before.
More specifically, only two out of ten Americans say that the United States is on the right track.
32 percent say they support Trump’s response to the pandemic, and 48 percent say he has done well in economics.
In March it was 56 percent and in January it was 67 percent.
According to an average of FiveThirtyEight, Biden is followed by 49.9 percent nationwide, while Trump is followed by 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has tried to draw attention from his performance against Biden’s epidemic, pushing for so-called cultural strife and promulgating policies that should turn law and order.
Biden’s offer, however, puts a lot of strain on keeping Trump’s attention and is likely to win if the election is really about how Trump has been in office for the past four years.
Trump’s infatuation also appears to be aimed at Republican lawmakers and fears Democrats could even reach a majority in the U.S. Senate, which has hitherto been very quiet.
Politico said in the days that the following groups and candidates are similar and it is now that the Republican Party would receive its greatest defeat in decades.
The outskirts proved particularly bad for the party in the 2016 parliamentary elections and now it looks like that development will continue.
In recent days, Trump has tried to scare the residents of suburbs to follow him, including by saying that he will become President Biden, he will destroy the suburbs of the United States and push for racial divisions.
Among other things, Trump has repealed a regulation from the time of Barack Obama in the White House that was intended to increase diversity in the suburbs.
He then encouraged “housewives” of U.S. suburbs to read an article after former assistant head of state New York, where she argued that Biden would wipe out U.S. suburbs and took Trump under it.
“Biden will ruin your neighborhoods and the American dream.
I’ll keep it, and even make it even better,” the president said.
Residents of the suburbs of the United States are an ever-growing group of voters.
According to the NPR, they are about half of all voters in the United States.
Ever since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who has won the majority of this group's votes has become president.
Except in 2012 when Mitt Romney got the majority of votes from this group but lost to Barack Obama.
Opinion polls have shown that despite Trump securing a majority in the 2016 outskirts, his escort there has shrunk significantly.
Although there are differences between the polls, Biden has measured about fifteen percent advances on Trump in the polls recently.

Will the Olympian Light be at the end of the hallway?
After a final decision had been made to postpone the Olympic Games, an event that only world wars have anticipated until now, the president of the International Olympic Committee said that the Olympic Games would become famous "the light at the end of the corridors," and that the world would be divided.
Africans have an extra year to prepare and the authorities in Japan are reimbursing their costs because of the delay.
Everyone has a lot of head in their head.
When it was announced that Tokyo, Japan, would be the venue for this year’s Olympics, the joy of the Japanese representatives was genuine.
They cried and laughed at each other, as Tokyo had applied to host the 2016 Olympics, but this time it was lower held for Rio in Brazil.
This time, Tokyo and Japan would bathe in the world’s attention.
The games were scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August but have been postponed for a year and will begin on 23 July 2021 and end on 8 August.
If they fail to keep the game then, if the corona virus is still too much of a threat, the game will be stopped.
No one wants to think about it to the end.
The Olympics are not a regular sporting event.
There is nothing to save, the show must always be magnificent and strive to top the last game.
The selection of a city for the Olympic Games is based on the evaluation of the selection committee on the presentations of the cities.
The more awesome the presentation is —the more likely you are to receive the buckle.
Tokyo spent $150 million trying to hold the 2016 Olympic Games, or roughly CZK 20 billion.
For the second time, when the 2020 Games were announced, 75 million dollars, about ten billion crowns, were put into the presentation.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo would receive the Games this year, the Japanese authorities had already donated as much as 30 billion crowns to the project.
However, this amount is only a drop in the ocean, depending on the cost of building Olympic villages, stadiums and in general strengthening the infrastructure of the country to cope with such a tournament, prepare it and hold the games themselves.
Planners in Japan have said that the Tokyo Olympics, which should have been held these days but have been postponed by one year because of the coronavirus, would have cost $12.6 billion.
However, a report by an auditor in Japan that came out at the end of last year showed that the cost was closer to double that number.
It will probably not be possible to fully estimate the cost of delaying the games, but it has been estimated that it can cost in the range of two to six billion dollars in addition to the initial cost.
The total cost to the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could therefore range from $15 billion to $30 billion.
There are such high figures that all the tax revenues of the Icelandic state only accounted for about half of the Olympic Games, based on the lowest possible cost.
The Olympics are an event of the magnitude that they have gladly become the subject of discussion by economists, who try to examine in numbers and view the benefits and benefits of the games.
In the shortest case, many seem to have come to the conclusion that the impact of the Olympics is less than positive for the economy of those who hold them.
Short-term impacts are some, for example, a large number of jobs very much for a short time, but for the longer term, cities are willing to sit up with debt debt and high operating costs of low-use structures.
Rio, Brazil, is in deep debt for the 2016 Games and has been in trouble with the cost of maintaining all of the major sports facilities built for the Games.
The 2012 London Olympics have seen evidence that only 10 percent of those who got a job at the Olympic Games in the city were previously unemployed.
This means that it was not about new jobs except to a small extent.
In general, cities have not been particularly successful in financially maintaining the Olympic Games because of the rising costs associated with the structures built for the Games.
However, the benefits are often seen in the increased traffic of tourists who want to visit the Olympic cities in the aftermath of the Games, although there is great uncertainty about the 2021 Games.
It is also unclear whether it will be possible to accommodate all the number of spectators who usually download the game.
The main thing, however, is the honor that cities are about to get elected, but it is difficult to estimate the funds.
Because despite the enormous cost, it can also be said that the joy that the games bring is not in the nature of being able to put on it.
But even though the show is very busy and there is no saving, of course, it is not just about money.
It’s the heroes that are at the forefront.
For some Africans, it’s surprisingly nice to just postpone the games.
For example, the Australian five-time winner and gold medalist at the Olympics, Chloe Esposito, is a bit of a mess and would have been a lot of fun this summer, but hopes to be in competition form for the 2021 Olympics.
She is therefore one of those athletes who is just quite happy with the delay, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who were going to stop after the games this year, if they had been held at the right time, the postponement of the games in some cases means that they stop racing before the games take place.
Rely on your body simply not to go through years in addition to rigorous exercises.
Few athletes were as adept in the hearts of spectators at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio as was the five-star Simone Biles.
She came home with four gold coins and one bronze.
Biles has recently appeared in several interviews in his home country of the United States to discuss the Olympics.
She’s going to play in 2021, but she’s not sure if she’ll still be at the top of the game next year, as she’ll be 24 years old.
Although it is generally not considered high age, it is generally higher for a fifteen-year-old woman in the lead.
“This is a sensitive issue,” says Biles, but smiles at another in an interview posted on the Olympic Committee’s Instagram page when asked if she intends to reach as far in the 2021 games as she did in Rio 2016.
“I really don’t know if I’ll still be at the top after a full year of practice,” says Biles.
She has previously said that her body does not tolerate the stress that comes with fitness training much longer.
However, she is still training for the 2021 Olympic Games.
Biles acknowledges that it has been an uncomfortable feeling to suddenly have to stop exercising when the world war was at its highest point and the gym was closed.
There were no exceptions for Biles rather than others while all sports facilities were closed for seven weeks.
All of her Olympians could not buy any access over the others, she had to find various ways to stay in shape like others.
The basics are certainly better than most people.
“We’ve got a tough plan now.
It was difficult to start exercising again until after the gym opened.
We started slowly but we are on the brink of a new start and I will increase the exercises evenly depending on what is going on this year.
Of course, we do not know exactly how these games will be or whether they will be held, but we still live with the fact that they will be, we can not do anything else.
I’ve put too much effort into quitting the sport now,” says Biles.
With it, like many others, doubts or perhaps rather the awareness that the position can emerge that the games will not be held at all in 2021, but rather.
Predicting it is hopeless.
No one can know how the position of the global coronavirus will be in July 2021 and nothing else to do but prepare for the Olympics given that they will be held this year.
Maybe the Olympics will be the light at the end of the Covid cycle.
Delayed wedding due to epidemic
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding due to the coronavirus outbreak.
She was due to marry former Bachelorette contestant Wells Adams this summer.
“I think there are other more important things to think about right now,” the actress told People.
“We definitely want to get married someday and then have the dream wedding and have all the attendees who are dear to us.
But we decided to put it on time and focus on what is important right now and that is to help share information about the importance of wearing masks and staying at home.
I’m more interested in weddings than weddings these days.
There’s a lot going on and we need to pay attention to what’s happening in the world.”
