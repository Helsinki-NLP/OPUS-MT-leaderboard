Members of the Welsh Assembly are worried that they will "seem like fools"
There is consternation among some MEPs over the proposal to change their title from AM'e to MWP'e (for Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was caused by plans to change the name of the meeting to the Welsh Parliament.
Members from across the political spectrum are afraid that it could trigger a mockery.
One member of the Workers' Party says his group is concerned because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wallis: In Wallis, twp means stupid and pwp means stool.
A member of the Assembly of the Plaid Cymru party says the group as a whole is "not happy" and has proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was "receptive" about the name change, but noted that it was a short speech jump from MWP to Muppet, the British equivalent of fool or fool.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced like the Yorkshire-English pronunciation of the letter you.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptions of what are called Members of the Assembly will, of course, be a matter for the Members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals that received broad support to call the meeting a Welsh Parliament.
As for the AM's title, the Commission chose Welsh Parliament Members or WMP's, but the MWP option received the most approval in consultation with the public.
AM's are apparently in the process of proposing alternatives, but the struggle to get consensus could be a headache for the chairman, Elin Jones, who will have to submit a bill on the changes within weeks.
The legislation on the reforms will also include other changes to the way the meeting works, including rules on disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AM's will get the last say in the question of what they should be called when debating the legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia."
The referendum was arranged in an attempt to clear a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has been insisting for some time that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim in its territory and has repeatedly opted out of its applications for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the popular vote on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
Supporters of the referendum, however, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are ringing because churches in Harlem are struggling
"Historically speaking, the old people I spoke to said there was a bar and there was a church on every corner," Adams said.
"Not one of them is there today."
He says that the disappearance of pubs is understandable.
"People are socializing these days in other ways," he says.
"Croatia is no longer a neighborhood of family rooms where people go regularly."
As for churches, he is concerned that the money from asset sales won't last as long as leaders expect, "and sooner or later they're back exactly where they started."
Churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums full of the kind of people who won't help the neighborhood's remaining shelters.
"The vast majority of people who buy units in these buildings will be white," he says, "and therefore will bring even closer the day these churches completely close, because most of the people who move into these condominiums are unlikely to become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist church moved away in the 1930s.
A black community that worshiped nearby took over the building's title.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community led by H.E. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, who did not want to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's members made plans to rebuild it, they ordered the carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the poor people's bells."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What has been played out in the past few months at St. Martin's is a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the church's lepers, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The church council, the municipality's governing body, which consists of leper leaders - wrote to the diocese in July with concern that the diocese "go try to pass the costs" to the church council, even if the church council was not involved in the appointment of the architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some council members complain about a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old at Crab Dive in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he dived for crab on the first day of the crab season in California, officials said.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then approached a group to help him pull out of the water.
Hammel says at first he thought it was just the excitement of a first crustacean catch, but then he realized "that he's screaming, 'I've been bitten!
I've been bit!"
His entire keybone was torn open," Hammel saw as he came out to the boy.
"I called out to everyone to come out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The boy was flown to the Council Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is described as critical.
It is not known which shark species is responsible for the attack.
Lifeguard Capt. Larry Giles said at a media briefing that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim sustained traumatic injuries to the upper part of his upper body.
Officials closed the beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to expand to the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's says Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams are struggling with department store-type beauty walks staffed by specialist assistants.
As part of a major expansion into the UK's <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow while sales of fashion and homewares decline, the larger beauty corridors will be tested across the country in 11 stores and if successful next year will be taken to more stores.
The investment in beauty takes place while supermarkets are looking for ways to fill shelves that were once used for TVs, microwaves, and household goods.
Sainsbury's says it will double the size of its available beauty products to 3,000 products, which for the first time will include brand names such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also gain more space with brand-specific areas similar to those seen in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also launching its Boutique make-up range again so that the majority of products are wipe-friendly - something that more and more younger buyers are insisting on.
In addition, the perfume retailer, The Fragrance Shop, will test concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon in South London and a second that will open later this year in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Internet shopping and a move to smaller amounts of food purchased daily at local convenience stores means supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury's chief executive officer, said the stores will look more like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight back with more services and non-food products against the discount stores Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and also launched a number of Habitat outlets since it bought both of these chains two years ago, which, according to them, strengthened grocery sales and made the purchases more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to renovate its beauty and pharmacy departments has failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after an argument about how to split the profits from the pharmacies within its stores.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business for <0xC2><0xA3>125m three years ago to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
It says Lloyds will play a role in the plan by offering an extensive range of luxury skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's Chief Commercial Officer, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty walks to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be on hand to provide advice.
Our range of brand names are designed to cater to every need and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a predominant beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones ran away "angry" after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled her out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby didn't have time for their home apparel and accessories brand, Truly.
The couple's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop trade name.
The This Morning provider, 37, announced on Instagram that she is pulling out.
Holly Willoughby has angered Dragons Den star Peter Jones by pulling out of their lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute - to focus on her own giant contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "enraged" when TV's golden girl announced Tuesday at a tense meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new opportunities - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant she could no longer have enough time for their home clothes and accessories.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop trade name and would have doubled Willoughby's estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones climbed on a jet and traded Britain for one of his holiday homes.
A source said: "Truly Holly's top priority was at a distance.
It would be her long-term future that would carry her through the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw from her was absolutely fouled by all those involved.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods at the Marlow headquarters that stands ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the This Morning provider, one of Britain's stars that makes the most money inflowing, the firm could drive millions out of the bag due to the hefty investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clergy and home clothes, and the possibility that its launch may encounter even more delays.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby formed Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple are on vacation together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the provider of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his business affairs."
The words "and then we fall in love"
He joked about criticism he's going to get from the news media because he made a comment that some would consider "unpresidential" and because he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his "newsreader's voice."
"I didn't give up anything."
He mentioned that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
Negotiations on nuclear disarmament have been stalled.
North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday, more than three months after the June leadership meeting in Singapore, that the North does not see a "coherent response" from the U.S. to North Korea's early disarmament activities.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure on.
Trump took a much more optimistic turn in his convention speech.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
"We were on our way to start a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this wonderful relationship."
He says his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results - ending firing tests, helping to free hostages and causing the remains of U.S. soldiers to be brought home.
And he defended his unusual approach to descriptions of relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have almost 200 people standing just there," Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Indonesia's tsunami and earthquake devastated island, killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were said not to be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population is de-rooted, no national disaster has been announced, a prerequisite to catalyzing international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they were not asking for international help, which makes it a bit difficult," Sumbung told me.
Although Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not sure whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Given the earthquake that Indonesia constantly endures, the country remains sadly ill-prepared for the wrath of nature.
While tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, it is not a common face to other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu likely contributed to the loss of life, albeit a warning of power.
It is at its best challenging to travel between Indonesia's numerous islands.
Natural disasters make the logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesia's flimsy infrastructure a core of his election campaign and spent lavish money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration is plagued by funding shortages as he faces re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also facing pressure from declining sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced, such as Christian and Muslim gangs with razor blades, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons fought on the streets.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge kicks good equaliser against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute.
Xherdan Shaqiri indicated to Sturridge when he was about 30 years ahead of the Chelsea goal and his team was 1-0 behind.
He hit the ball to the left before kicking far to the goalpost.
The attempt sailed high over the window as it hovered to the upper right corner of the net.
Eventually, the ball tumbled over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and into the net.
"It was just trying to get in that position, to get on the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as far as possible, so I just tried to create as much time for myself as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and tap once and didn't think too much about it and just kicked."
Chelsea were 1-0 ahead after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues' goalkeeper played Mateo Kovacic again in that back-to-back playing area before touring near the midfield and innings in the Liverpool half.
Kovacic quickly received and indicated in the middle field.
With a beautiful forward kick, he then led Hazard into the window.
Hazard passed the defence and finished with a left-footed kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker in the furthest goal.
Liverpool play at 3 p.m. on Wednesday in the group stage of the Champions League at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton at 3 p.m. in the UEFA Europa League in London on Thursday.
Death toll rises to 832 following Indonesian tsunami
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami rose to 832, the country's disaster agency said on Sunday.
It has been reported that many people have been trapped under the rubble of buildings that caused the earthquake, which struck on Friday at a magnitude of 7.5, to collapse, and caused burns of up to 20 feet, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with its more than 380,000 people, was dotted with the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman stabbed to death
A murder investigation was launched after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old was found at 7.55 a.m. in Grayson Mews in John Street with knife sticks, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police urged people in the area who had heard or seen anything to come forward.
Investigator Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage but I appeal to anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught anything on dashcam footage, to contact us as they may have information that may be indispensable to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman showed up at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are continuing as the police said they were in the process of informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver who lived in Grayson Mews had recently tried to return to his apartment but was told by police that no one was allowed into or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now told it will take hours before they are allowed back in.
It has been heard that a police officer told one man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears on the scene.
She said repeatedly, “It’s so awful.”
At 2 a.m. there were two police cars inside the cordon with another car just outside.
A number of officers were left inside the cordon to monitor the block of apartments.
Anyone with information is asked to call <0x40>MerPolCC to DM, 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 with log 247 of 30 September as a reference.
Parliament's Statute of Cromwell Becomes Latest Commemorative Score With 'Rewrite of History' Dispute
His banishment would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artefacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's proposal as "sadness" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate about the removal of statutes that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The image stormy of the English Civil Wars was neither commanded by Cromwell nor carried out.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's manifold depiction of Cromwell was evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the history of a figure that many still believe to be memorable.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate representation is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the middle 17th century gave shape to the later development of our nation, and that Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of that separation.
His success as a Protector is also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
Murder Swine Rifle Chinese Farmer
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China.
The man, identified only by his of, "Yuan," was found dead with a torn butcher covered in blood near a hut at the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to inject pigs with vaccines at a pig farm in Xining of Qinghai Province, China on May 30, 2005.
He was reportedly traveling with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his nephew found him dead and found a door to a neighboring piggy bank open.
He said there was a large male pig in the cage with blood on his mouth.
A forensic investigation has confirmed that the 550-pound pig killed the farmer.
"My cousin's bones were bleeding and torn," said the cousin, who was named on his of, "Wu," the Guiyang Evening News quoted him as saying.
Security camera footage showed how Yuan entered the market on Thursday at 4.40 pm to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man does not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening New that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking someone else, while the police collected evidence on the scene.
Yuan's family and the branding authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although strange, cases of pigs that attack humans have been reported before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig tied a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife deterred the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBS News that pigs are not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as "faster."
"They're just playful.
They're picky, very curious... they're not about to hurt you.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa will bring widespread heavy rain to the southwestern United States.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over the cooler waters of Mexico's north coast.
However, Rosa will bring flooding across northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. over the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 85 mph, a Category 1 hurricane, from 5 a.m. on Sunday, and was placed 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough over the Pacific Ocean begins to take shape and move eastwards to the west coast of the U.S. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, heavy tropical humidity northwards will begin to drive the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical humidity in response to the approaching trough will bring widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest over the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous kite floods, waste streams, and possible landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause site-to-site rainfall rates of up to 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially over most parts of Arizona.
Kite floods are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the widespread nature of tropical rains.
It would be extremely unwise to venture it on foot into the desert with the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rains can cause deep-clouded desert rivers to hit and thunderstorms will bring heavier local winds and dust clouds.
The approaching trough will bring some local heavy rain to parts of Southern California's coastline.
Rainfall total figures of more than half an inch are possible, which can cause low waste flow and smooth ripples.
This will be the region's first rainfall of the wet season.
Some widespread tropical rains will make Arizona late Sunday and early Monday beginning closer before the rains make Monday and Tuesday more widespread.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
October can see intense temperature fluctuations across the U.S. as the North Pole cools down, but the tropics remain very warm.
This sometimes leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature differences across the central U.S. is on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, thriving summer heat will try to rise and expand again.
Large parts of the central and eastern U.S. are expected to start warming in October, with widespread 80s from the Southern Lowlands to parts of the Northeast.
The city of New York can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a higher chance of above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. for the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh trial.
More than 20 million people watched on six television networks on Thursday the touching testimony of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christiane Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault alleged to have occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programs for Friday's on-the-fly turn: an agreement reached by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh betaed her in intoxication and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a heartfelt testimony, said he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched it on Friday, Nielsen reported.
The company counted average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures were not immediately available for other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN, and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen sometimes finds it difficult to meet people who are looking in offices.
To put it in perspective, it's an audience as big as one for a decisive football match or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose pollsters strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had all the networks in front with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long hearings, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest was always high after the trial.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he was going to vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was caught Friday morning on CNN and CBS where opponents shouted at him when he tried to take a lift to a Judicial Committee.
He stood for a few minutes with his eyes slammed down while CNN vividly depicted him being beaten up.
"I'm right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth?"
It was said to him, "You have power while so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office issued a statement and walked in before the elevator door, saying that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcast networks all later covered live hours when the Judicial Committee would vote to promote Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would look into the allegations against the candidate for next week, as requested by the Democratic minority.
Flake is partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators thereafter, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was powerful because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
May accuses critics of 'political game' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has criticized her plans to leave the European Union, accusing it of "political play" with Britain's future and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May is due to attend the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In another interview alongside one with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs was "completely ridiculous."
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and arrested on a charge of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims had lost his glasses during the set-up.
Police found the glasses on the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on it, according to CBS affiliate WAFB.
After they interrogated Simpson, the police said he admitted that he had shot Wayde.
His bail was set at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
East Baton Rouge Parish's law enforcement agency released a preliminary report on Friday saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head at the neck.
The department praised the Louisiana State Police's fugitive task force, the state police's crime lab, Southern University police, and local citizens for their help with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletics director Joe Alleva thanked regional law enforcement for his "agreement and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot-six forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played for LSU basketball.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball frigate Will Wade said the team was "plagued" and "shocked" over Wayde's death.
"That's what you're worried about all the time," Wayde said.
Volcano spewing as on Mexico City
As spewing from the Popocatepeti volcano, the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital have reached.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after picking up activity in the crater and registering 183 releases of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The center has multiple spins and shooting monitors.
Images on social media showed how thin low-gas engine windshields near Mexico City like Xochimilco covered.
Geophysicists have seen an increase in activity at the volcano, which sits 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.1 struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists to commemorate independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and thousands joined counter-protests to commemorate the first commemoration of Catalonia's polarizing vote for resignation.
A group of masked pro-separatists held back by riot police fired eggs and threw powder paint that caused dark dust clouds in streets that usually swarmed with tourists.
A riot broke out later in the day and the police had to use their knuckles to keep the fighting in check.
Over several hours, pro-independence groups chanted in one tone "No Forgetting, No Forgiveness" in confrontation with the unionists' cry of "Long Live Spain".
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries sustained in the parades, the local press reported.
Tensions remain high in the independence-minded region a year after Madrid's October 1 referendum was deemed illegal but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly voted to become independent but the turnout was low, with those against dismissal largely boycotting the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried in violent clashes to prevent the voter turnout at polling stations across the region.
Pro-independence groups camped on Friday night to prevent a protest in support of the national police.
The protest continued but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist demonstration with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful for the prospect of Catalonia gaining independence.
"Last year we had one of the best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy because they could vote but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite a life-threatening, however, nail-biting victory in regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties this year struggled to maintain momentum, with many of their best-known leaders either in self-imposed exile or in detention in pretrial detention for their role in organising the referendum's involuntary election.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who picked up the protest in support of police on his phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since late last year, announced that he will stand in European Parliament elections next year.
"To stand as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to reject the decline in democratic values and the repression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Man arrested after driving home vasry
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly rammed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident unfolded on Thursday at around 19:30 BST in Ballynagardsingel.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was done to the gates and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been fired at the car at some point.
Menga goal gives Livingston 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secures victory
Promoted Livigston stunned Rangers to transfer Steven Gerrard to only his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal was proof of the difference when Gary Holt's team moved with Hibernian to second.
Gerrard's team stayed that season in the Premiership without a win and will face the forwards Heart next week, which they are eight points ahead of.
Rangers will be hosting Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston extends their undefeated run in the division to six games, with head coach Holt still not defeated since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses chances against bot visitors
Holt's team had to advance long before they scored a goal, with their round-breastedness pulling Rangers into all sorts of trouble.
SR broke through, but turned in front of the goal cage, then AL could only play wide after he came closer and CH's head held across the goal cage.
The hosts were pleased to have Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could get the visitors with death game moments.
And so the decisive goal came.
Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston created an opportunity, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson giving Menga the chance to kick and score a goal from the middle of the frame.
By that time, Rangers had dominated possession but could not penetrate through the home defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely unconcerned.
That pattern continued in the second half even though Alfredo Morelos forced a beating from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was sacked by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow tapped wide to evade yet open play from Livingston.
Crossings repeatedly reached Livingston’s window and repeatedly turned over, while two penalties – after Halkett’s challenge of substitute Glenn Middleton and one for handball – were dismissed.
Livingston’s ‘Phenomenal’ – analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
It's a great game for Livingston.
Until the last man was excellent; they still exceed expectations on this uphill course.
Their style of play and team have been almost unchanged since their return to first place, but much honor comes to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hackett was huge with his manifold defense rank while Menga kept on their toes for Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
The Rangers are inspiring.
As good as they were at times under Gerrard, they could not maintain those standards.
Their final ball was missing and only once could they penetrate through the home team, which is somewhat of a wake-up call for Rangers, who are in the middle division.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an to receive mixed reception in Cologne
There was smiles and blue air on Saturday (September 29th) when leaders from Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which had to restore relations between NATO allies.
They had a stalemate on issues that included human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent the 25,000-strong crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters also showed up to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many of them Kurdish – have also blunted their voices and condemned both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The protests reflect the dissension of a visitor who is hailed as a hero by some German Turks and ousted by others as an outlaw.
Deptford road accident: cyclist dies in collision with motor
A cyclist was killed in a collision in London involving a car.
The collision occurred around 10:15 BST near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics were present but the man died on the scene.
The collision comes months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, about a mile from where Saturday's accident occurred.
The Metropolitan Police said officials were working to identify the man and alert his relatives.
Road closures and bus routings are in place and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six detainees injured in riot
Six detainees were injured in a riot at a high-security human prison, the prison office said.
The protest erupted around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire.
Specialist "Tornado guards" have been summoned to handle the riot, which includes eight prisoners and is limited to one wing.
The guards were treated on the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prison ministry spokesman said: "Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed to pay attention to a continuing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and can stay behind bars for longer."
HMP Long Martin houses more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
It was reported in June that the prison's chief aide received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot officials were summoned to pay attention to serious disturbances during which personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Floods (Drying Areas May Take Advantage)
It's unusual for a tropical low to hit Arizona, but it's exactly what could happen early next week if Hurricane Rosa's remaining energy moves across the southwestern desert, bringing kite flood risks.
The National Weather Service has already issued kite flood watches for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday, and by late Monday will approach with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones since 1950 have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border.
The National Hurricane Center's models predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon outskirts of Arizona.
Other parts of the American Southwest, including the Central Rockies and the Great Comet, are likely to get 1 to 2 inches, with isolated totals of possibly up to 4 inches.
For those outside of kits flood risk, Rosa's rain is likely to be a blessing as the region is plagued by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious issue, this rainfall is likely to be beneficial as the Southwest is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, only about 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least extreme drought, the second highest category.
First, Hurricane Rosa's path leads to approaching land around the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still at hurricane strength Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm hits cooler water in the Pacific Ocean and therefore takes its force off.
So it is expected to reach the country on Monday afternoon or evening against tropical storm strength in Mexico.
Rainfall over parts of Mexico can be heavy and carry a significant flood risk.
"Total rainfall of 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before it reaches the Arizona border as a tropical depression in the early hours of Tuesday morning and will then move through Arizona and to southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
"The biggest danger expected from Rosa is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the U.S. Southwest," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening kite floods and debris flows in the deserts and landslides in the mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage sons of a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stabbing wounds in Somerset.
The injured teenage son was found on Saturday at about 04:00 BST in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital where he is still in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Officials have appealed to anyone who may have any cell phone footage of what happened to come out.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffered from the community, the anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the relentless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered from the community, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday and fiercely and emotionally denied an allegation by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her allegation.
The president said on Saturday that Americans saw "the brilliance and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote to uphold Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to uphold one of the most competent legal minds of our time, a jurist with a pure record of public service," he told the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican uprising in the mid-term elections.
"Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
"I'm not standing, but I'm standing," he said.
That's why I'm fighting everywhere for these candidates."
Trump said the Democrats were on a mission to "resist and obstruct."
The first major procedural vote on the Senate floor over Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP leadership assistant told CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesian shooting, tsunami, with figures still rising
At least 384 people were killed and many washed away when huge waves broke on beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday for a party on the beach when burners of up to six meters (18 feet) high broke at sunset on the beach, many washed away after their death and destroyed everything that was in the road.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and did not run immediately and they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for Indonesia's disaster intelligence agency BNPB, told a news briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come on its own, it dragged cars, bumps, houses together, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was moving across the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before it hit the coast.
Some people climbed trees to free the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency show numerous buildings and shops destroyed, bridges tangled and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the city was still under fire.
A series of earthquakes have been felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's agency for the evaluation and application of technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's giant blast was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which sits at the tip of a long, narrow bay, could have aggravated the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found where they were trapped under the debris of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the accidents and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala that is closer to the earthquake site.
Communication "is completely impeded with no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a disaster, but it can get much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not reporting a tsunami hit Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In amateur footage shared on social media, one can hear a man on the top floor of a building screaming desperate warnings about the upcoming tsunami to the people down the street.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the beach and sloping buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't immediately explain the footage.
The shaking and tsunami caused major power outages that cut off communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuations were still in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has only been reopened for relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia-Tsoenami death toll rises to 800.
This is very bad.
Although World Vision’s staff from Donggala arrived safely in Palu city where employees were sheltered in cover shelters erected in their office’s courtyard, they passed on their way to scenes of devastation, Mr. Doseba said.
They told me that they saw many houses that were destroyed," he said.
This is very bad.
Even as aid groups begin the atrocious task of setting in motion the disaster relief task, some people have complained that foreign aid workers with a lot of experience are prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian guidelines, funds, supplies and personnel from overseas can only start running after the area of the disaster has been declared a national disaster area.
This hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says, 'Okay, this is a national disaster,' we can open it up to international assistance, but it still doesn't have a status."
With the arrival of the second night on Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing are hoping that their loved ones will be the miracles that will bring relief to the sad storyline of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of a sewer pipe.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman who had been trapped under debris for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia's national parachuting team, has cleared two of the missing parachuting teams for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Another of those who were trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, Mr. Mandagi included, were his students.
"As a senior in the parachuting field, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon tells how, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel circulated on social media among the parachuting community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants who participated in the beach parties.
However, his messages were only answered with a grey check mark, instead of two blue check marks.
"I think that means the messages aren't delivered," he said.
The thief steals $26,750 during refill of OTM by Newport on the Levee
The thieves stole $26,750 on Friday morning from a Brink's worker who refilled an ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a news statement from the Newport Police Station.
The car's driver was busy emptying an ATM in an entertainment complex and preparing to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man "came running from behind the Brink's employee" and stole the bag of money that had to be delivered.
According to the release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing from the scene, but the police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye
With the announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The creature formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live where he is expected to introduce his new all-Yandhi.
He replaced Ariana Grande on the program that cancelled for "emotional reasons," the program's manufacturer said.
In addition to the fact that it is an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has already said in the past that the word has religious meaning for him.
"I believe 'yes' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year when he discussed his album title with radio provider Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, this is us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – just the reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are."
He is one of a number of well-known rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs was previously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, has also come up with or without a hyphen and capitals.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed in the run-up to the country's 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against students to never use military power against civilians.
Lopez Obrador vowed at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that he would "never use the military to tame the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, soldiers shot at a peaceful demonstration in the plaza where up to 300 people were killed at a time when leftist student movements across Latin America were poaching.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and a lack of training opportunities are attracting the youth to gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding
With China becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. must double the amount it spends on research in that field, said investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The remarks come after several parts of the U.S. government made AI announcements, even briefly the U.S. has an overall formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China last year announced its plan: they aim to be the No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the AI research budget will be a good start, given that all the other countries are so far behind the US and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI," Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the chances of the next big AI performance being achieved in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the HUB of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the highest-rated American Othello player and later served as a board officer at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee has acknowledged previous technology competitions by the U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotics challenge and asked when the next one will be, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes away the academic leaders; it's the corporate ones," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired influential people from other universities to work on AI.
Lee says immigration policy changes can also help support U.S. AI efforts.
"I think green cards should be automatically offered to PhDs in AI," he said.
China's State Council issued its Next Generation Development Plan for Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint center for artificial intelligence that aims to engage partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a review committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million per year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has come under fire for months.
Macedonians vote in elections or country's name should be changed
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether their name should be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia," a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that blocked its membership bids for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, insists that its northern neighbour's name represents a claim in the field and has refused their admission to NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June, based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argued that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign cast doubt on whether the vote would meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot read: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have argued that it is a price that can be paid to seek admission for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough MEPs have said they will accept the outcome of the vote to decide on it.
The name change will require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of inconvenience at 1 nm.
But the turnout was then only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia's EM, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko cast their votes for the referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name that will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
Before the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small raise and drew chairs in front of tents set up by those who are going to boycott the referendum.
"We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of the Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the vast majority will be in favor of it, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he cast his vote.
He said a "yes" result would be "confirmation of our future."
A poll published last Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research said between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - less than the required amount.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A setback in the referendum would be the first serious setback for the policy of a pro-Western government since the government took over in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero navigates throughout Brighton defense for goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling cleared the Brighton defence in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy during his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine goalkeeper received a hint at the midfield at the start of the series.
He chased through between three Brighton defenders before hitting the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He passed by one defender before passing several others on the edge of the Brighton field.
He then pushed a sign to the left, where he found Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the cage to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a kick to the right of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with problems with his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
This is what happened.
We're happy that he scored a goal at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League wrestling.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep in the Brighton area.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane had a few touchdowns before he led Sterling to the farthest goal corner.
The Sky Blues' forerunner kicked the ball into the net just before he was over the rear line.
City takel Hoffenheim in Champions League Tuesday at 12:55 nm. at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play against the Rockies
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there's not much reason to force another start.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer wants to take on the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, who have a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies scored at least a promoter's pick with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but still want to fix their first division title.
"Although we don't play for nothing, we can at least play the game knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team is likely to play at the highest level from any point I will face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to take part in it?"
The Nationals have yet to announce their starter for Sunday, but are reportedly in favour of having Scherzer throw in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will have his 34th start, had a throwing practice session on Thursday and will play on his normal rest Sunday.
The Washington right-handed are 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 draws in 220 2/3 turns this season.
Trump to hold meetings in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court election, Brett Kavanaugh, as he spoke about the importance of Republican uprising in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
It's one of the big, big ones - I'm not standing, but I'm standing, and that's why I'm fighting everywhere for these candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "One sees this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, one sees it happening now.
And they are now determined to take back the power by using any possible way, one sees the community, the genius.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to walk over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and strength, we're not going to give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "resist and obstruct."
"And one sees it over the past four days," he said, calling the Democrats "evil and mean and funny and fake."
He referred to the name as the Senate Judiciary Committee's high-ranking Dianne Feinstein, who received harsh beatings from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?"
Have you leaked the document?
- Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I’m waiting for one – it was really weak body language – the weakest body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer a broad church.
It's intolerable to those who say what they think.
When Momentum's activists in my local party voted to put me under censorship, it wasn't exactly a surprise.
After all, I am the last person in a string of Workers Party LPs to be told that we are not welcome – all because we have said what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she stood up in a fearless way against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censorship criticized me for differing from Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically enough similar issues on which Jeremy differed from previous leaders.
The announcement for the Nottingham East Workers' Party meeting on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as the local Workers Party LP, it was exactly what Friday night's AR meetings were.
Unfortunately, today it is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of "friendlyr, more benevolent" politics has long been forgotten, if it ever began.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated within the Labour Party and each opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party's leadership.
It began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I thought I had previously shared similar political views began to expect me to make a U-turn and take positions that I would never otherwise have agreed with – whether on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – there is a tidal wave on social media that asks me not to be re-elected, rejection of politics from the core, and telling me I shouldn’t be in the Workers’ Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I'm actually happier than my colleagues because the comments that are directed at me tend to be political.
I have a lot of respect for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist insults every day, but never shudder away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult have normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn last week argued that the Workers' Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every "movement of distrust" or change of selection rules, the party gets worse.
I've had a lot of advice over the last two years that encourages me to stay under the radar, not to be so outspoken and that I'll be "okay."
I don't have the policy to do that.
Since I joined the Workers’ Party as a schoolboy 32 years ago, spurred by the Thatcher government’s neglect that literally left my state high school failing, I’ve been trying to fight for better public services for those who need it most – whether as a local councillor or government minister.
I never hid my politics, even at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been at all confused about my policy positions and areas where I differ from the current leadership.
To those who advocated the motion on Friday, I can only say that with the country sending on a Brexit that is going to hurt all households, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Workers' Party.
But the one message I actually have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it's to my constituents, whether they're now members of the Workers' Party or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats of not being re-elected or political advantage will stop me from doing what I believe is best for all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unconquered Ayr above
Two late threes may have diverted the final result slightly, but there's no doubt Ayr deserved to win in this wonderfully entertaining Tennent's Premiership game of the day.
They are now at the top of the pointer, the only undefeated team of the ten.
In the end, it was their excellent defense, as well as their better shots, that carried the home team and coach Peter Murchie has every right to be satisfied.
"We've been tested so far in our matches and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Honor to Ayr, they took their chances better than we did."
Grant Anderson's three in the 14th minute, which was foiled by Frazier Climo, made Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scotland player Rory Hughes, which was made available for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to count the numbers and Jason Baggot scored one.
Climo increased Ayr's lead with a penalty kick, just before he set a solo three-time goal to make it 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's three, targeted by Baggot, reduced the setback to five points.
There was a long delay for a serious injury at Ruaridh Knott that was carried down on a portable, and from the start Ayr increased the lead with a Stafford McDowall three, targeted by Climo.
Ayr's observant captain Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card and again Melrose took advantage of the extra player with an undetermined three by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a lot of pressure play.
The home team made a comeback and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he killed Climo without the ball, and from the penalty spot MacPherson pushed the ball dead behind the incoming Ayr free kick.
Climo set it up, as he also did almost from the start, after Kyle Rowe scored David Armstrong's goal and sent flank Gregor Henry away for the home team's fifth-three.
Still game star looks like he's starting a new career in the restaurant industry
It looks like Still Game star is going to move to the hospitality industry after it was discovered that he was appointed as the director of a company of licensed restaurants.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he writes and plays with old comedian Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the show's last, and it looks like Kiernan is preparing for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, though a source at the Scottish Sun suggested Kiernan wanted to get involved with Glasgow's "flourishing restaurant industry."
'The sea is ours': surrounded Bolivia hopes court will reopen away to the Pacific
Matrose patrols a massively-covered naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a navy blue flag.
Fleet bases from Titicaca Lake to the Amazon are lined with the slogan: "The sea is rightfully ours.
It's a duty to get it back."
Across the landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the coastline they lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still fresh – as is the need to sail the Pacific again.
That hope is likely the highest it has been in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the international court on October 1, after five years of talks.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peace, and of course expects the outcome with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the IGH ruling on big screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will find in favor of Bolivia’s claim that – after decades of sporadic negotiations – Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign passage to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president – who faces a controversial fight for re-election next year – also has much to depend on Monday’s ruling.
"We are close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will decide in Bolivia’s favor – and that little will change if it did.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to assign Chilean territory, and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the IRH's ruling comes just six months after the last, shows that the case "was not complicated," says Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And rather than helping Bolivia's cause, the past four years may have slowed it down.
"The issue of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian administration," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has affected any remaining Chilean benevolence, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to hold talks at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold talks in the aftermath.
The two countries last exchanged ambassadors in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was extremely quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will "bring an extraordinary opportunity to begin a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of differences with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the maritime issue as a political stool.
Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't come unless they can trust the U.S.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his country would never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it could not trust Washington.
Ri was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He appealed to the United States to deliver on the promises made during a summit in Singapore between the competing countries' leaders.
His remarks follow U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is apparently on the verge of restarting nuclear diplomacy, which has reached a dead end, more than three months after Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a "dream image" that continued sanctions and U.S. captioning of a declaration that ended the Korean War will also bring the North to its knees.
Washington is cautious about agreeing to the declaration without Pyongyang first taking meaningful steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about relinquishing an arsenal that the country considers the only way to ensure their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris Fashion Shows Reveal Latest Series of Large Headwear on the Road to the Stores Near You
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely dislike the sun, you don't need to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne introduced a series of laws oversized headwear at their SS19 collection on the walkway that enchanted the style at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats went through Instagram this summer and these designers paraded their stunning creations on the runway.
The highlighter by Valentino was an oversized beige hat with a feathery wide rim that swallowed the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included watermelons decorated with jewels, a magic hat, and even a pineapple – but it’s not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had worked lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One ship looked like scuba gear, with a snorkel and diving goggles included, while another looked like a melted ice cube.
And if you continue the great fashion trend, this is your lucky day.
Stylists predict that the huge guards might be on their way to the shops near you.
The oversized hats follow briefly on the heels of 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two-foot wide rim seen on everyone's heads, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely impractical hat spread across social media sent another great creation across the runway – a straw-beach bag that was almost as big as the swimsuit-wearing model that wore it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, finished with raffia frays and finished with a white leather handle at the top, stood out at Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL, “I expect to see big hats and beach bags appear in stores next summer – as the designer has made such a huge impact that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for the citizens of the world
Scotland's independent schools have a track record of academic excellence, and this was continued in 2018 with another set of excellent exam results, which have only been enhanced by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other community enterprises.
With more than 30,000 schoolchildren across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their schoolchildren and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their pupils for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their position as world citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailor-made school curriculum, we see world languages continuing to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
It's a powerful reminder that we can't just rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's recent exam results, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest pass rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of schoolchildren who studied foreign languages achieved a higher grade A.
The data, collected from SCIS's 74 member schools, showed that 72 percent of students achieved a higher grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 of those who studied French, and 63 of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young adults will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages now, as a subject, have the same reputation as the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools' curricula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission on Vocations and Skills found in 2014 that of the reasons that employees provide why they struggle to fill positions, 17 percent are attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more likely jobs requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career that someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with such a lifelong skill.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically put a multilingual person above the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15 percent.
That's why it's so important to invest in today's children's language education.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with a better chance of getting meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while other languages will teach which are considered essential for the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teaching staff who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare and equip children with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what the future holds.
It cannot be denied at this stage, in a global business environment, that languages are still very important for the future of the country, and therefore they must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should really be regarded as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland's young people.
You have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his debut for the San Diego Lakers on Sunday.
The wait is almost over for fans to see how LeBron James makes his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in San Diego in Sunday's pre-season opening game against the Denver Nuggets.
How many minutes he's going to play has yet to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited amount of time.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six games in the pre-season program.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage in my career to get ready," he said.
Trump's West Virginia convention, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is scheduled to hold a general election in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first of five scheduled gatherings in the next week, including stops in friendly locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the affirmative vote currently being held back for his election to fill the vacancies in the Supreme Court, Trump intends to build support for the upcoming midterm election because Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when it is voted on in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how do you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, was scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's reunion in West Virginia via live stream below.
Trump is likely to pay attention to this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct with an expected confirmation vote held back for up to a week as the FBI investigates.
But the main point of view of these excesses is to help the Republicans facing difficult elections in November.
President Trump's campaign said these five meetings over the next week were aimed at "visiting volunteers and supporters while Republicans are trying to protect and enlarge the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Control over Congress is so critical of his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we reach the busy campaigning season," a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
Tonight's rally, which was arranged for the Wesbanco arena in Wheeling, can draw fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and can be covered by the media in Pittsburgh," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the voting patterns.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him a boost at the ballot box," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team shows they have the courage to fight to keep hope alive when they enter Sunday's singles game
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's four-game teams were probably just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging sling of momentum is an all-encompassing sports concept but one in which players believe wholeheartedly, and certainly in competitions like these.
Where do you think the momentum is now?
"They went ahead with six points and now it's four, so we're carrying it as a bit of momentum, I reckon," Spieth said as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage, four points ahead and twelve more that are being played.
The Americans, however, feel, as Spieth says, that they have such a little wind in their sails and that there is a lot to encourage them, not least not the class of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spieth was deadly from the top to the clean field and led by his example.
That score became harder as his round progressed and he dropped a critical set-up to win game four fully equal while he and Thomas were two laps behind.
She set which won the game at 15 for them was greeted with a similar shout, the kind that tells one that he believes the American team has another chance.
"You really just have to get everything out and worry about your own game," Spieth said.
That's what these players are up to.
18 bucks to print their stamps.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's odd but adorable couple got four out of four and can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't record one on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided one on Saturday morning as well as during the last nine Friday mornings.
That run, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from this lavish crowd, confirms that they are the players to be beaten on Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari who can ring a potential European victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Prefer both at the same time or at different pots.
It's too early to talk about the future of Europe.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short stint with Sergio Garcia, the morning's four-ball hero, when he played alongside Alex Noren.
One keep on track and two doubles on the front nine put the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they could hardly even get out.
On Sunday, there's no one to help you out of your hole.
The four-ball and four-game teams are so exciting to keep a close eye on because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change at a glance.
Europe has always played better as a team so far and has taken the lead significantly on the last day, but this four-game session also showed that the US team has the courage for the fight that some, especially at home, have doubted.
Europe runs 10-6 ahead of the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a healthy advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after they came with a 10-6 lead from Saturday's four-ball and four-game matches.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods to take their score so far at Le Golf National to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, trying to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that performed unequally in the morning's four-balls, so they won the series 3-1.
The U.S. fielded more resistance in the four games and won two games, but they did not shrink the back.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from Sunday's 12 singles games to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, named "Moliwood" after a sensational weekend, are just the second pair in the history of the Ryder Cup to score four points after their first four games.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, they played excellently together to beat a dad Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambreau with an even more convincing 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, sometimes showed flashes of brilliance but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four balls and four games and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning's four balls, returned to play alongside Henrik Stenson in the four games to a 2&1 defeat for Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are first and third in the world rankings.
However, on a pleasant day with a breeze southwest of Paris, Europe did not always get its meaning.
Jordan Spieth who has won a major tournament three times and Justin Thomas set the mark for the Americans on Saturday with two points.
They recorded a difficult 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 3&4 in the four-games after losing the first two pits.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team recovering from a four-point lag when they enter the singles game, although Furyk's team just need to play head-to-head to keep the trophy because they already hold it.
However, after being second best for two days, it doesn't look like they'll manage a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says it will "definitely not" unilaterally disarm without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions aggravated their distrust of the United States and that the country would certainly not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally without such qualities.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea has taken "significant benevolence measures" over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, demolishing the nuclear test site, and promising not to harness nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We don't see any consistent response from the U.S.," he said.
"Without any trust in the U.S., there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances, we will certainly not disarm ourselves unilaterally first."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to nuclear weapons removal according to which North Korea will be rewarded if it takes gradual steps, his words seemed meaningful because it did not do unilateral removal of nuclear weapons unconditionally.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-Oen and Donald Trump at the very first summit between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore when Kim undertook to work for the "destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula" while undermining North's security concerns.
North Korea wants a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls for tight international sanctions on North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on 'destructing nuclear weapons first' and exerts more pressure by tightening the level of sanctions to achieve its goal in a compelling way, and even objecting to the 'declaration of the end of the war,'" Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can force us on our knees is a dream of the people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are aggravating our mistrust."
Ri did not say anything about plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader drew attention to at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings during the past five months between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in and added: "If the party in this issue of nuclear weapons destruction reached South Korea and not the US, it would not have the point of destroying Korea so far."
The tone of Ri's speech was nevertheless dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korea's fireballs would be aimed at the U.S. landmass after "Mr. Bose President" Trump sent a "fireball" to Kim on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage for taking steps to disarm, but he said much work still needs to be done and sanctions still have to remain there until North Korea destroys nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a time frame for this, saying "It doesn't matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia are of the opinion that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps they have taken.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that: "The application of sanctions by the Security Council should continue zealously and without ceasing until we realize the full, final, confirmed destruction of nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to dry up funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the outskirts of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip there did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, but North Korea accused him only hours later of making "benign demands."
North Korea has promised in a meeting with Moon to demolish a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States takes "conforming measures."
He said Kim told him that the "conforming measures" he wants to see are security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore as well as steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on enough rus
A new course at Harvard University this year allows all of its undergraduate students to get more sleep in an effort to counteract the growing macho culture of studying by caffeinated 'all-night sessions'.
An academic has found that students at the world's top university are often unaware when it comes to the basics of how to look after themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the U.S.
He was inspired to start the course after he gave a talk about the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end of it, one girl approached me and said, 'Why are they telling me this now, in my senior year?'
She said that no one has told her how important sleep is - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, offered for the first time this year, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as how it improves their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university had decided to introduce the course after it was found that students were seriously asleep during the week.
The hour-long course involves a couple of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a dormitory, where students need to click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise shoes, and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation and the importance of a sleep-time routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risks of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know this won't change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know what the health impact of choosing to smoke cigarettes is," added Prof Czeisler.
The culture of pride to "study all night" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students has meant that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
To make sure you get enough good quality sleep, a student's "secret weapon" should be to avoid stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he said - even to avoid it from putting on weight, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in a starvation mode, which makes you feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after running one of his classes during his first year at Harvard last year.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to pursue a campus-wide course.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the institution where people compete with each other.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students should consider setting an alarm for when they are going to sleep, as well as when to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm and cause you to struggle.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goal of Menga defeats Gerrard's men
Rangers experienced another sarcia away heartbreak when Dolly Menga's goalkeeper Steven Gerrard's uncompromising team won a 1-0 defeat.
The Ibrox team wanted to win their first as visitors since February's 4-1 win at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team handed Gerrard only his second defeat in 18 games as a driver so his team was eight points behind Hearts, who went hand in hand in the Ladbrokesship.
Menga beat seven minutes ahead of rest, and it didn't seem like a Rangers team would play without a lot of inspiration.
While Rangers now fall to sixth position, Livingston climbs to third and is only behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there may be further difficulty for Rangers after border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an object was apparently thrown off the side.
Gerrand made eight changes to the team that stormed past Ayr after the final match of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livi-11 that took a point from Hearts last week and he would have been in his nods with the way his well-trained team batted their opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have dominated the ball, but Livingston did more when they had the ball.
They actually had to score points after just two minutes when Menga's first deposit passed Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder opened up his big chance.
A deep free kick by Keaghan Jacobs was then found by Captain Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow was only able to miss the rear goal.
Rangers took control, but it seemed as if there was more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos felt he had to score a penalty at the quarter-finals when he and Steven Lawless clashed, but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's demands.
Rangers managed to get only two shots to the target during the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was badly battered by Lassana Coulibaly's header and a soft goal from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opener at the 34th minute may have been against the direction of play, no one can deny that they deserved it, even if it's just for their hard work.
The Rangers once again didn't handle a deep set of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained coolhead and sent it to Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted at the break when he traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the exchange had an almost immediate impact when the wing sent to Morelos but chased the impressive Kelly from his stripe to the block.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play exactly the kind of game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett clinching long ball after long ball.
Holt's team could have increased their lead in the final stages, but McGregor stood up well to stop Jacobs before Lithgow could enter far from the corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton had another late claim for a penalty kick when he clashed with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geigerteller
And now a page from our "Sunday morning" almanac: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and WE TALK AGAIN... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geigerteller has been a pillar of science, and it has also become a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," in which those two unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played:
Man: "What on earth is this?"
Rogers: "This is a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you set up these earphones, you can even hear the effect of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: "Guys, this is about to crack!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' robber cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' and kill predatory cells
Immune learns immune system to identify predatory cells as part of treatment
The method involves the removal of immune cells from a patient, changing it into a laboratory
They can then 'see' a protein that is common to many cancers and then inject it again.
A test substance shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
One woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to identify predatory cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein found in many cancers called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "drives the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, Prof Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to attack cancer cells has worked to beat some kind of leukemia.
Kanye West began a pro-Trump mockery after his appearance on SNL, while wearing a MAGA hat.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was released during a Saturday Night Live in the studio after a lengthy performance in which he believed U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would make him eligible in 2020.
After singing his third song of the evening, which is called Ghost Town and during which he wore a Make America Great-pet, he ran out against the Democrats and repeated his support of Trump.
"I talk to a white man so often and they say, 'How can you like Trump, he's a racist?'
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, the footage of West's scallop was uploaded by comedian Chris Rock on social media.
It's unclear if Rock for West is trying to spot it by putting it on.
West also complained to the audience that it was difficult for him behind the stage about what he was wearing on his head.
"They've been bugging me up the hill.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat on."
They've bullied me!
And then they say I'm in a low place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West preceded, "Do you want to see the low place?" and said that he would put on his "supercoat, because it means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try the love."
His comments sparked an outcry at the audience at least twice, and members of the SNL cast seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there telling the publication: "The whole studio has gone silent."
West was brought in as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, the rhyming cleaver Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West was very surprised with a performance of the song I Love It, dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West was backed by the head of the TPUSA conservation group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest minds: THANK YOU for resisting the damage."
But chat show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "who he is and it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his 'art') who I believe accepts and preaches an ideology that puts my community at risk.
He is free.
"We too," she added.
Before the show, the rhyming clutterer announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he is now "the creature formerly known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Co-Rhyme talker, Snoop Dogg, had the name Snoop Lion and, of course, wacky music-adhesive Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Accused of trying to kill a knife cutter at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.

The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast state court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington criticizes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-swapping role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, criticized the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on screen mean that young boys often feel that they have to be tough to be respected.
Kit spoke to The Sunday Times Culture saying he believes "something went wrong" and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his co-star from Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he feels "reasonably strong" about making this issue work.
"I personally feel pretty strongly about it at the moment - where did we go wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What did our men learn as they grew up with regard to the problem we are seeing now?"
Kit believes that television is most likely responsible for the growth in toxic masculinity due to its extremely masculine characters.
He continued, "What is native and what is taught?
What is being taught on TV and in the streets that makes young boys feel that they should have this certain aspect of being a man?
I think that's really one of the big questions of our time - how do we change it?
"Something's obviously going wrong with our young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not participate in any of the Game of Thrones sequels when the series comes to an end next summer, as he says he is "ready with battlefields and horses."
From November, Kit will play in a new version of Sam Shephard's True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones was to meet his wife Rose.
"I met my wife on this program, so that way it gave me my future family, and my life from here on out," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the premises of Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country are affected, health officials said.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted by sex, representing a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly throughout parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has risen to 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is a critical issue in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very common.
Due to the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of these diseases come from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, China's government has pledged universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to make the case work.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked GOP senators' data, condemns "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters said on Saturday that a member of her staff had posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the legislators' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed the allegations were driven by "ultra-right" experts and websites.
"Lies, lies, and more disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information allegedly included the home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on the Capitol Hill during the Senate panel's hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was linked to Waters' office and disclosed the information of a member of Waters' staff, the Hill reported.
"This unfounded claim is completely untrue and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information, and security have been compromised as a result of this fraudulent and false allegation - was by no means responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely untrue and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly sparked online criticism, including from former Withuis spokesman Ari Fleischer.
"This denial testifies to anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that she does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't be angry.
He shouldn't be challenging.
He didn't question the prosecutor's motives.
He has to be calm and calm."
Fleischer apparently compared Waters' reaction to the Democrat's criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of apparently being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate trying to oust Waters in the midterms, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if that's true," he tweeted.
In a statement, Waters said her office had "informed the appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities of these fraudulent allegations.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continued, "and that they will be legally liable for everything they do that is destructive and dangerous to every member of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again review - blur Rowan Atkinson spy spotting
It is now traditional to look for Brexit significance in any new British-themed film and it seems applicable to this revival of the Johnny English action comedy mockery franchise - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and continued to struggle with Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Will tongue-in-cheek self-satire about the subject of how obvious power we are to be the nation's new executive opportunity?
In any case, the unhelpful Johnny English with his pussy and rubber face had his license to squander everything renewed for the second time - and his name is a clearer indication than anything else that he is a great comic creation for non-English-speaking film audiences.
He is, of course, the ridiculed secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretense of sophisticated elegance, took a bit of Clouseau, a piece of Mr Bean, and a good shot of that old man who contributed a single note to the Chariots of Fire theme song at the 2012 Open Spelling Festival in London.
He is also originally based on the traveler and international man of mysteries, who leaves chaos behind him, who Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard ads.
There are one or two cute moments in this latest version of YOU.
I liked Johnny English who came running to a helicopter while he was dressed in a medieval armor and hooded the screw blades briefly against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is showcased but the humor feels rather blurred and oddly exaggerated, especially when the "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now use comedy with self-confidence as an ingredient.
The humor feels like it's aimed at children rather than adults, and to me, Johnny English's adversity is not as original and focused as Atkinson's silent jokes in the persona of Bean.
The perpetual thematic assumption now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cybercracker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret network of spies and revealed the identity of all Britain's agents in the field, to the agent's dismay at service - a regrettable little role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a prime minister who is a bloated and beleaguered character, already experiencing a total collapse of political infatuation: Emma Thomspson is doing her utmost with this quasi-Teresa May character but there is little in the text to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy is endangered, she must call someone out of retirement.
And that means the struggling Johnny English himself, now serving as a teacher at some decent institution, but giving off the record lessons on how to be a secret agent, there are some cute jokes here when English offers a School of Rock-type espionage school.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency mission and is reunited with his former long-suffering comrade Bough, again interpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, an all-mapping role in which too little is expected of Vicki Pepperdine.
So the Batman and Robin are about to completely squander everything in Her Majesty's secret service completely to service again and they descend on Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister finds himself under the dangerous spell of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the enigmatic Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of ridiculous escapades: disguised as waiters set fire to a French restaurant, they cause chaos when they smuggle themselves aboard Volta's luxury sailing yacht; and English lets pure anarchy break loose when he tries to use a virtual reality headline to get acquainted with Volta's inside.
For that last scene, nothing is spared, but as cute and exuberant as it may be, the whole affair is pretty much like children's TV.
Fairly mediocre.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: can't the British give Rowan Atkinson a role that really brings his talent to justice?
Work denies it's a plan for Britons to work a four-day week but be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party must consider a drastic plan that will cause Britons to work a four-day week - but be paid for five days.
The party claims that company bases savings caused by the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Revolution should be passed on to workers by giving them extra day.
This will allow workers to enjoy a three-day weekend - but they will still take the same payment home.
Sources say it would "fit" the party's economic agenda and plans to put the country in the favor of the workers.
To change after a four-day week was endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an ambition that fits the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of the worker as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party will not be the first to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day working week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, this ambition is not endorsed by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not party policy and is not considered by the party."
Skadu Minister John McDonnell used last week's Workers' Conference to expand on his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from "faceless directors" and "winners" at service companies.
The shadow minister's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not get their entire investment back as a workers' government can make "deductions" on the basis of alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed plans to place workers on company boards and create inclusive equity funds to give 10 percent of equity in private sector companies to employees, who can receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their mind
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising the question of whether the bureau's findings can convince any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican sense. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could deepen anything that could change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed more receptive than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said at the beginning of the trial, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, that accusation came out, and said, "Did you do this?
He was determined, determined, unequivocal."
Graham's voice, however, appears to be immutable.
"I have formed my opinion about Brett Kavanaugh and it will require an accusation of dynamite," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Brett vehemently denied it," Graham continued, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she calls couldn't confirm it.
He is 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is the World Citizens' Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the World Citizens' Festival, an annual music event that has a particularly impressive group of stars performing and has an equally impressive goal; the end of poverty in the world.
The World Burger Festival is now in its seventh year and during the festival, tens of thousands of people will flock to Central Park's Great Lawn to not only enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the opportunity's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens' Day, which began in 2012, is an extension of the World Anarchy Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless you're willing to pay for a GDP ticket), concertgoers had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions," such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or making any other meaningful way of behaving.
But just how successful was World Citizen with 12 years left to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to convince people to call for action, or is it just another case of so-called "clickivisms" - people who feel they make a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Weltburger says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, supporting a multitude of different goals.
It says these actions have helped spur global leaders to announce commitments and policies equal to more than $37 billion that will potentially affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and announcements stemming from its actions, of which at least $10 billion have already been paid out or raised.
The group estimates that the confirmed money so far has had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include the Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children reach their full potential," and vowing to give $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after they donated more than 4,700 tweets.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and world citizens just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd in April 2018 at a concert in London.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions taken to bring the UK closer to improving nutrition for mothers and children, the government has announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the common questions on his website that asks "what makes you think our extreme poverty can end?"
World Citizen replied: "It will be a long and hard road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will be successful because we have more power together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the artists performing at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use fleet for "blockade" to curb exports of Russian energy - Interior Minister
"If necessary," Washington may abandon itself on its fleet to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed Russia's involvement in Syria - in particular where it works at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to act as energy brokers just like in Eastern Europe, the south of Europe," he said.
And, according to an official, there are ways and means to tackle it.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the seas are open, and if necessary, to block, to make sure their energy does not end up on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the attendees of an event offered by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that sees itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the U.S.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran and noted that they are practically the same.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to finance and replace fuel," he said, referring to Russia as a "single talent" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come as the Trump administration was on a mission to give the export of their liquid natural gas to Europe a boost to replace Russia, by far the cheaper option for European consumers.
For that reason, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, have been trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says makes Berlin Moscow's "prisoner."
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's ardent opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak told a meeting with U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. view provoked backlash from Germany, which reaffirmed their commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), told a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will be "seriously considering" standing as president in 2020, the Massachusetts senator said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "consider seriously" standing as president after the mid-term elections.
During a village meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider standing.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and put our shattering government right and that includes a woman at the top of the sport," she said.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider standing for president."
Warren laughed at President Donald Trump during the town hall meeting, saying he was "taking the country in the wrong direction."
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was very vocal in her criticism of Trump and his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
A poll released Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters don't think she should stand in 2020.
Eighty-five percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not stand, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
Thirty-two percent supported the idea that she should stand.
The poll showed more support for the idea that former governor Deval Patrick should stand, with 38 percent supporting the idea that he should potentially stand and 48 against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed for possible standing in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a decision in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin Names Track Palin's PTSV at Donald Trump Convention
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining in September
He was arrested on Monday night and charged with an incident of domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, what he has been going through since he came back, I have sympathy for other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and the injury with which our soldiers are returning," she told an audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans, "they come back a little differently, they come back hard, they come back and wonder if there is the respect for what they and their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the army have given to the country."
He was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on Monday and charged with domestic violence, assaulting a woman, interfering with a complaint of domestic violence and possession of a firearm while under the influence, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Station.
18 states, D.C. support challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that refuses asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district filed a friend-of-the-court legal order in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker and challenge the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the claimant in the Grace v. Sessions case filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been made public.
She says her partner "and his violent gang members," abused her, but U.S. officials refused her request for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of U.S. asylum seekers, as nations facing deep-seated gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals in 2014 that allowed immigrants without the necessary documents fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal, and international laws."
"Federal laws require all asylum applications to be determined on the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such advocacy violates that policy," the friend-of-the-court order said.
Lawyers further argued in the legal order that the policies denying immigrants access harmed the U.S. economy and said they were more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary labor."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to no longer allow asylum to victims fleeing due to domestic and gang violence.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their homeland due to persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his announcement of the policy on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems – not even all the serious problems – faced by people around the world every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly nypend.
"It feels very tense," 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma said as she comforts her feverish baby son at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute there's an ambulance.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents have been seen returning to their devastated homes, searching for impounded possessions, trying to save anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-magnitude shaking, were overwhelmed.
Of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had a fractured back and shoulder, rested outside Palu's Army Hospital where patients are treated outside due to continued strong post-shocks.
Tears fill his eyes as he recounts the violent earthquake that shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I'm stuck in the rubble of the walls, I think," Haris told Associated Press, adding that he and his family were in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my son.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda advertising"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper that praised the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily’s paid insertion into the Des Moines Register — the state of Iowa’s highest-selling newspaper — after accusing China of meddling in the U.S. congressional election on Nov. 6, a complaint China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election, noting what U.S. officials told Reuters, is a new phase in a growing campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught in an escalating trade war that has led to their tariff rounds equating to each other's imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were aimed at hitting exporters in states like Iowa who backed Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former governor of Iowa for a long time, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is now aggravating the harassment by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press."
"By spreading their propaganda, the Chinese government seizes America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, one would find at the newsstand in the street here in Beijing very limited deviant voices and not see any true reflection of the divergent opinions that the Chinese people have about China's worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers shook away from the offer to publish his article", although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans alienate women's voters before midterm elections with Kavanaugh debacle, warns analysts
While many top Republicans at the Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh stand up and defend him in the face of multiple allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that they will see a backlash during the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The emotions about this are going extremely high, and most Republicans are on record as already indicating that they want to continue with the vote.
Those things can't be reversed," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s encouragement for an FBI investigation into the nipple would be enough to pay angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday - they are not going to forget it tomorrow and not in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, said Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is on the way!" as they protested in the Senate's entrance portal while the Republicans who controlled the Judiciary Committee chose to continue Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic said.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to be very high," Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it was already high; it's true.
But it could be higher, especially among swing-themed female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who don't often vote because they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony sets out the details of her allegation of sexual assault against the Supreme Court-nominated, analysts said a counter-reaction could follow if Republicans continue with the confirmation.
"This has become a mess for the GOP," Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the committee's vote or the final vote and whether Kavanaugh is put on the bench, it's also about the way the Republicans handled it and how they treated her," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
But Americans seem somewhat divided about who to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimonies, with slightly more choosing the latter's side.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe Ford's testimony, while 35 say they definitely or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh was likely or definitively joking during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's urging, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford testified last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh assaulted her at the age of 17 while he was drunk.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court-nominated his genitals were exposed to her while attending a party during their student years at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the global web plans to start a new internet to tell Google and Facebook the fight
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global web, launches a startup that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company building on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee mocked that the idea with Inrupt is "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said of the project.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, agendas, calendars, music library, and other personal and professional utilities.
It's as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available at the same time and in one browser.
What is unique about personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user who can access that type of information.
The company calls it "personal authorization by data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's HUB John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, processes, and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, developers on the staff contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers from around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the utilities available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about launching a total change whether or not, where all their business models are completely reversed overnight.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy as well as an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even as he leads Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about this next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross Spiritual Celebration
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won the Victoria Cross as a warrior during World War I was honored 100 years later in his hometown.
Lt. Col Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a sniper and never knew he had won the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was unveiled Saturday by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning achievement.
According to the London Gazette, Lt. Col. Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918 "through very dense mist and under heavy fire from the field and machine guns."
He later rushed to the line of fire and with the "greatest courage" led the line forward before he stormed a man-only field rifle and knocked out three of the division.
Lt. Kol Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never do, but something that is humiliating."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said he "felt grounded to be able to play a role in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given by a bunch of people."
MMA supporters stay up all night to watch Bellator 206, but get Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stay up all night to watch the full-packed Bellator 206, just so you can't watch the main event.
The program of San Jose included 13 fights, including six on the main program that would be broadcast live through the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were on their way to tell each other the battle, viewers in the UK were stunned when the cover changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unimpressed after waking up to the early hours, especially for the fight.
One supporter on Twitter described the switch to the children's cartoon as "some sick joke."
"It's government regulation that the content was not appropriate at 6 p.m. and therefore they had to switch to children's programs," Dave Schwartz, Bellator senior vice president of marketing and communications, said when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig," yes.
Bellator's president Scott Coker said they would work on their schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about the recast, I think we can probably work something out," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to sort it out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But our work on it.
Believe me, when it switched, there were a lot of text messages being sent back and forth and it wasn't all friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We will limit it to five battles instead of six – as we normally do – and we have tried to offer more to our fans and just went over our time.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley 'feels inferior' about sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority about his sexuality – but that gave him the motivation to be a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't go to high school until he realized that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he laughed at his feelings about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that becoming a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The regular provider of the years-long program, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to illness.
When he appeared as a dislike on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less" than anyone else when he grew up, because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said: "Until today, those feelings of feeling less than, and feeling differently, are the real things that gave me the strength and energy to succeed."
He wanted to prove he was "something," he said, so he wouldn't disappoint anyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT fighter and has used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He says he has cheered his feelings because he is so happy to be able to live openly without consequences and want to give others "hope."
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man – U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “captured him.”
Daley was married last year to the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than he is, but says the age difference has never been an issue.
“When you’re going through so much at such a young age” – he went to his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar highs and lows.
The couple became parents in June to a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says his "whole perspective" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was all about 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
"My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley says his dad didn’t accept that he was going to die and one of the last good things he asked was if they already had tickets for London 2012 – because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't say to him, 'You're not going to be here to be in the front row, Dad,'" he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only after he stopped breathing and was dead that I finally admitted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I just knew that this is what I've been dreaming about my whole life - to dive in front of my home crowd at an Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song selection – Proud by Heather Small – which also resonated with him in the build-up to the Olympics and still gives him chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson doesn't drive and retires on Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to make his form to prevent it from being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who plays for a record 12th time in the biennial event, was pulled into the game by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's four-ball games and quarters.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time Major winner will split his day between being a race leader and working on the practice top of his game in the hopes of fixing what's going on.
Even at the height of his career he was never the straightest driver and therefore the 48-year-old is not the ideal person for the narrow Le Golf National course where the long roughness always punishes the wandering holds.
And as if the track on its own isn't challenging enough, Mickelson will face the exact British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their games this week, in his ninth game on Sunday.
If the Americans, who are four points behind, start the 12 singles games well, Mickelson's game can be absolutely essential.
She expressed her confidence in her husband, not that he could say much else.
"He fully understood his role that he had today, gave me a slap on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be right tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is in the Heroes Hall and he has contributed so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I didn't think he was going to play two games.
I put more into the perspective, but that's how things worked out and that's what we thought we should do.
He wants to be there, just like anyone else."
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for the player who played the most Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never really matched the highlights of his individual accomplishments.
Mickelson had 18 wins, 20 defeats, and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence contributed intangible aspects to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's caught, he likes to shave the crazy, and he's a wonderful old man to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players also enjoyed shaving crazy with him, which was fun to see.
He offers so much more than just a game."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows big lead could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead over the last day's singles play in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable experience.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where the team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead, but only won nail scratch with 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"One keeps reminding oneself that we had a great lead at Valderrama; we had a great lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won nail scratches," said Bjorn, in the photo, after watching how the 2018 Class was won by Le National on Friday 5-6-3.
So, history will show me and everyone on the team that it's not over.
You're going to be successful tomorrow.
Go out and do all the right things.
It's not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, and that's to try to win the trophy, and that's where the focus stays.
I still say all the time, I focus on the 12 players that are on our team, but we are also well aware of who is on the other side - the best players in the world."
Rejoicing over how his players got on the difficult golf course, Bjorn adds: "I'll never get ahead of things with this.
Tomorrow is a horse of a different color.
Tomorrow it's the individual participation that comes to mind, and it's a horse of a different color.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're there individually, you're tested to your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message you need to convey to players, get the most out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he needs to get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his peer Jim Furyk will want his players to sail better individually than they did as playmates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Fury himself was already on both sides of that great last-day reversal, where he was part of the winning team at Brookline before he ended up as a loser when Europe achieved the "miracle of Medinah."
"I remember every hidden word of it," he said in response to being asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, spoke courage to his players on their way to that last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but one would like to start well, as seen at Brookline, as seen at Medinah.
When that momentum starts to go in one direction, it puts a lot of tension on those middle matches.
We set up our team accordingly and divided the men that we felt, you know, would bring something magical to us tomorrow."
Thomas got the task of trying to lead the counterattack and came into the main game against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter being the other Europeans in the top half of the classification.
"I chose this group of guys in this order because I think it covers it to the end," Bjorn said of his single-player choices.
Germany's new warship postponed again
The German army's newest frigate would have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era warships, but it won't be there until at least next year, due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reports.
The commissioning of the "Rhineland-Palatinate", the flagship of the brand new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to The Zeit newspaper citing a military spokesman.
This vessel had to join the Fleet in 2014, but the agonizing post-delivery issues plagued the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class vessels ordered by the Fleet in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, a battalion of air defense and anti-ship missiles as well as several secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years away from homeownership.
But continuing delays mean that the advanced warships – which will apparently enable Germany to project power overseas – will already be obsolete by the time they enter service, calls The Time.
The disastrous F125 frigate made stockpiles last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into service and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media have mentioned that a number of essential "software and hardware defects" render the ship useless if deployed in a campaign.
Software defects are particularly important as the Baden-Württemberg-class vessels will be handled by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half the manpower on older Bremen-class frigates.
It also came to light that the ship was drastically overweight, reducing the work performance and reducing the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton "Rhineland-Palatinate" is thought to be twice as heavy as ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the price tag for the entire project – including the training of the crew – also raised an issue.
It apparently reached an incredible <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – more than the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
Problems that have bite the new frigates are becoming especially important in light of recent warnings that the strength of Germany's fleet is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the fleet's "ships that can be deployed are on the rise."
The official said the issue has worsened over time, as old ships have been put out of service, but no replacement vessels have been provided.
He complained that none of the Baden-Württemberg class could join the Fleet.
The National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
New research is being conducted on a estate in the Scottish Highlands that aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common and soprano vertebrate bats as well as the brown longhorn and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed on important locations on the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also do mobile surveys using hand-indicators.
Expert sound analysis of all surveys will check the regularity of the bat groups and determine which species do.
A habitat map and report will then be compiled to create a detailed landscape scale image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation adviser for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat for the bats are the most important and how it is used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management such as pasture farming and how to best manage forest lands for bats and other associated species.
Butterfly populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleeping space and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, as well as fly paper and some chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks by house cats.
The bats aren't really blind.
But because of their nightly hunting activities, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-orientation technique to point out goggas and obstacles on their flight paths.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is very serious about bats.
It has ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys and sleep site inspections and sometimes perform rescues.
The organisation even set up Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal site for them.
"Here at Threeave we have a wonderful area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, lots of veteran trees and all the good habitat.
But there's so much about bats that's still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us better understand what they need to thrive."
He emphasizes the necessity of searching for bats before maintenance is done in properties because it is possible that the unknowing destruction of a single litter can mean the death of up to 400 females and toddlers and can exterminate an entire local population.
Flea mice are protected and it is illegal to kill, disturb, or prevent them from destroying their sleeping places.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to jump in to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations fare."
Ronaldo dismisses rape allegations as prosecutors prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has dismissed rape allegations against him as "fake news" and said people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are ready to sue the German news magazine, Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus forward was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in 2009 at a Las Vegas hotel.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 to remain silent about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In an Instagram Live video in which he addressed his 142 million followers, hours after the allegations were published, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the reports as "fake news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but that's part of the whole thing.
I'm a happy man and everything is right," the player smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyer is preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the claim, which they called "unacceptable reporting of suspicion in the field of privacy," according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would claim compensation for "moral damages for any amount that corresponds to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
The alleged incident allegedly took place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed with Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and said he was "99 percent" a "good old man" who was abandoned by the "one percent."
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claimed she went to the police and had pictures of her injuries taken at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "fearful of retaliation" and worried about being "publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old says she now wants to reverse the settlement because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack and moved to Italian giant Juve in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal this summer.
Brexit: UK will 'forever regret' if it loses its car manufacturers
The UK will "repent forever" if it loses its status as a world leader in automotive manufacturing after Brexit, Secretary of State Greg Clark said.
He added that it is "concerning" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it will have to temporarily halt production at the plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese vehicle manufacturer said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant – which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis – produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production at our factory shut down," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have feared leaving the EU without an agreement and how cross-border trade will function.
BMW, for example, said it would close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what automakers say supply chain risks are in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line runs on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be disruption at the border that the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to maintain more than a day's stock at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production will be halted.
Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid those border checks."
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that, as I say, will allow not only to enjoy the current success, but for us to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The indications from not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers, is that we absolutely need to continue with what was an extremely successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but warned that added costs in the long run could reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite union's caller on the site, says his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when these posts disappear, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a precise and acceptable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed, says Withuis
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed by another week" as the battle over nominees for the high court continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special legal adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, links between Trump aides and Russia and possible law-breaking by the president.
Whether or not Trump is going to dismiss the deputy attorney general, and thereby threaten Mueller's independence, has been fueling Washington's scathing stories for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of carrying a recorder to record talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, amid reports that he was on his way to thank.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "choose not to thank" Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate judiciary hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh and further postponed the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "A date for that has not yet been set, it could be this week, I can see that it is being postponed by another week with all the other things that are going on with the High Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some journalists will disagree with that statement: Sanders hasn't held a Withhouse press briefing since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the scarcity of information sessions is not due to a reluctance for TV journalists who are "effect-hunting," although she said: "I will not argue with the fact that they are effect-hunting."
She said that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president holds more R&D sessions than any president before him," she said, adding without citing evidence: "We've looked at the numbers."
Information sessions will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, then it's infinitely better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it a lot and you've seen us do it a lot over the last few weeks and it's going to take the place of a press briefing when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump frequently answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press releases with visiting dignifiers.
Solo press releases are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, by making an unbound and with time, bizarre appearance to journalists gathered there.
Secretary of Health writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Secretary of Health has written to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to show the country's gratitude and express the wish that they will continue after Brexit.
Jeanne Freeman MSP sent a letter with less than six months left before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of processed status applications for EU citizens working in the delegated public services.
In her letter to me. Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the UK and EU on withdrawal continued, on the way to expected decisions this fall.
But the UK government has also stepped up its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That's why I want to repeat how much I put each staff member's contribution on the prize, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we would love for you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie had an emergency operation after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee team's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee state head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before rest time.
"He came to the sideline and sort of just collapsed there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen along the sideline before he was placed on a portable and taken back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee state official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was out of the theater at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details yet about the type/scale of the injury" and Tennessee is still trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year academic, is in his first season at Tennessee State after moving away from Illinois.
He killed five times on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his total for the season to stand at 18 dead.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal tax when they buy a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal taxes when they buy a property in the UK and the extra cash will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Tory plans.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's effort to attract young voters
The seal tax will be levied on those who do not pay tax in the UK.
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year – to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal taxes when they buy a property in the UK – with the extra cash that will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's effort to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high earners.
The seal tax increase will be levied on individuals and firms who do not pay tax in the UK, with the extra money that will help the government's plans to combat homelessness.
The surcharge – which is outside the current seal tax, including the higher levels imposed two years ago on second homes and homes bought for rent – can be as high as three percent.
The Treasury expects this move to bring in up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built London properties are bought by non-UK citizens who are pushing up prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot in the housing door.
Many affluent areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “ghost villages” due to the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in seal taxes to help more young people own their first home.
He accused major construction firms of keeping property prices high by grabbing land, but not using it, and encouraged Ms. May to renounce quotas on affordable homes to repair Britain's "household disaster."
Mr. Corbyn announced a striking series of proposed housing improvements, including rental management and an end to "no-error-settings".
He also wants to give councils greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my prime ministership to restoring the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means restoring our broken home market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it can't be right that it's just as easy for individuals who don't live in the UK, as well as overseas based companies to buy homes as it is for hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of homeownership has become a distant dream and the humiliation of homelessness has become too great a reality."
Jack Ross: "My biggest ambition is to run Scotland"
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become Scotland's driver at some point.
The Scot, 42, enjoys the challenge of breathing new life into the North-East team, which is currently in third place in League One, three points below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country.
I picked up the second team, but that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But as a child, I often looked at Hampden with my father for Scotland and it's something that pulls me back.
"The opportunity can only come if I'm successful with club management."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he felt no fear of following such established names at such a large club, after previously showing off offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment, success for me will be measured by 'Can I have this club return to the Premier League?'
Due to the structure and facilities at this club, it undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get it there, but I would probably only consider myself successful if I could get the club out there again."
Ross's career in management was only three years, after a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month period on Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa return from relegation to the third league and transformed St Mirren from on the verge of relegation to Champions League winners in the following season.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than he ever felt during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he says when he thinks back to how he took over Alloa's vows.
"I really thought the management was the right place for me, even more than playing.
It sounds bizarre, because I did well enough, made a reasonable existence out of it, and experienced fairly highs.
But the game can be difficult.
There are a lot of things that a person has to do every week.
I'm still going through this in terms of the stress and pressure of the job, but management just feels right.
I've always wanted to drive and now I do, it feels the most comfortable I've been in my own skin all my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 nm. on a Saturday, find recording
The summer heatwave improved Britain's struggling pubs' revenues, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Beverages and pub groups saw sales rise by 2.7% in July – but receptions in restaurants were down by 4.8 percent, figures showed.
Peter Martin, of business consulting firm CGA, who compiled the figures, said: "Progressive sunshine and England's longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup meant that Julie followed a similar pattern as last month, June, when drinking spots were up by 2.8 percent, apart from restaurants getting even more swords.
The drop of 1.8 percent in restaurant shopping in June only worsened in July.
Drink-guided drinking places and pubs fared better and rose more than restaurants fell.
Food-guided drinking spots also suffered in the sun, but not as bad as restaurant operators.
It looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
All over run pubs and drinking places, sales rose by 6.6 percent for the month, with food wasting down by three percent."
Paul Newman, of leisure and hospitality analyst RSM, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home-out-market.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a drop in sales of 4.8 percent year-on-year will be particularly difficult above and beyond ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-guided operators and only the time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we have experienced since August will bring necessary relief."
Total sales growth across drinking places and restaurants, including new places that opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand announcements.

One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One in five children – some as young as 11 – have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, a survey reveals
Survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in "false Insta pages"
The news has heightened fears that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of learners say they have a "main account" to show to parents
One in five children – some as young as 11 – create social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in “false Insta accounts” – a reference to the photo sharing site Instagram.
The news has heightened fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of learners said they have a clean "main account" to show to parents, but also have private accounts.
A mother who landed on her 13-year-old daughter's secret site has found a teenager who encourages others to "rape" her.
The research, at Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half of them admitting they have private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that so many teens are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't track them down."
Eilidh Doyle to be 'vote for athletes' at Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Council of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the governing body's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie has described the move as a wonderful opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her far-reaching experience at the international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh has great respect across the Scottish, UK and global athletics community and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from what she brings to the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I'm keen to act as a voice for athletes and hope I can really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Games in Atlanta under his four gold Olympic medals, is now a regular BBC expert, unable to walk after having a brief ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "Today, a month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but having fully recovered, again learned how to walk and do agility exercises today!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Breast pumpkin advertising that compares mothers with cows share opinions online
A breast pumping company has shared opinions online with an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers to cows that are milked.
In celebration of the launch of what's called the "world's first silent portable breast pump," consumer technology company Elvie has released a tongue-in-the-cheek music video-inspired ad to showcase the freedom that the pump gives to breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of straw and cows on the palate of a song that includes lyrics such as "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see a tail" and "In case you haven't seen, it's not uiers, it's my breasts."
The chorus section reads: "Pump it out, pump it out, I'm pumping the babies, pumping it out, pumping it out, I'm milking my ladies."
But the ad posted on the company's Facebook page has caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed response from viewers, with many saying it underplayed the "awesomeness" of the dairy industry.
"Very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, but their babies are often stolen from them within days of giving birth," one wrote.

Another commented, "It's traumatic for mom and baby.
But yes, why not use it to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "The advertisement is so out of touch."
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that the song was "screaming funny" to her.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd have had one if I'd always had one.
Milking out made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a bit crazy, but I accepted it for what it is.
"It's a great product," one wrote.
Another person noted: "This is a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who are milking out (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like "cows."
It's not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women show that they all danced with the discreet pump in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who skip milk say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is silent, has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly into a feeding bra that gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while milking.
Ana Balarin, partner and UKD at Mother, remarked: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a great and exciting launch.
By drawing a parallel between women who are milking and dairy cows, we wanted to put the milking process and all its challenges into the spotlight, while in an entertaining way that people can find connection demonstrates the wonderful sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump has picked up the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the run for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children silently moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply even though monthly border agencies have remained relatively unchanged, in part due to strong rhetoric and policies put in place by the Trump administration that make it harder to put children on bail.
Traditionally, most bailiffs were also undocumented immigrants and feared that their own ability to stay in the country would be jeopardized by stepping forward to claim a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential burglars and other adult members of their households would have to take their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement before Congress, testified that the agency had arrested thousands of people who applied to bail unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal records.
"Nearly 80 percent of the individuals who are either bailiffs or family members of bailiffs are illegal here in the country and a large number of them are criminal aliens.
That's why we continue to pursue those individuals," Mr. Albence said.
In an effort to process the children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of arrest, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear via video conferencing call, rather than in person, to advocate their case for legal status at an immigration court.
Those who are considered unfit for emergency relief will be deported quickly.
The longer the children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Lawyers say those concerns are heightened at a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs that a child's struggle is more easily overlooked because of the size.
They added that moving the children to the tent village without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally to say goodbye to friends can aggravate the trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish ‘occupation forces’ to withdraw immediately
When he addressed the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country's war was in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said the foreign powers were illegal on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and would be "handled accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the meeting.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions more unrooted, is "nearly over."
He said Damascus would continue "to carry out this holy battle until we have cleansed all Syrian territories" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising Kurdish forces as well as Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France with more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said conditions are in order for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "irrational fears that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have appealed to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing something that should just be a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib's last major rebel stronghold had created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has defied a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front who would be "exterminated."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings soon of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem prescribed conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee and said the panel's work should be limited to "checking the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 re-election unless, as many liberals are likely to hope, a state of accusation and scandals ends his presidency early.
In what is without a doubt "the most dramatic finale of a presidency will ever be!"
To date, there are no signs of eye fatigue.
Since 2014, peak time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CCN and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNCBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million peak time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" is at the top of cable TV ratings with as many as 3.5 million viewers on big news nights.
"It's a fire that people are drawn to because it's not something we understand," says Neal Baer, program manager of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor" about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Congressional building.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The manager told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" Scovell told me.
There's a lot of fun in this chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the storylines that come from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, or immigrant families can reunite and the health of the world economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond just being an informed citizen when you're in the sixth hour of it to watch a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" from his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 full-length leather-flying swimsuit, said to the Postman's shoe, "a garment of the thickest."
I'll never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he does that makes it feel like a reality show is he feeds you something every night," says Brent Montgomery, chief operating officer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars," about the Trump program's changing role distribution and daily links in the plot (such as seeking Russia with N.F.N.P.R., Kim).
You can't afford to miss one episode, otherwise you'll stay behind.
When I reached for Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not tear himself away, was not on his way with Brett Kavanaugh to appear before the Senate Judiciary and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
"I remember when we did all those crazy programs at the time and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was kind of a joke, but now it turns out they were right."

Out-of-pocket flow after most exciting mid-term election race in the House
It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th sees an influx of money, thanks to a shift of congressional districts that has now brought two office-holders into a race for the same seat.
The recently changed suburban Pittsburgh district has Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring – measuring forces.
Lamb is opposed by another office bearer, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which heavily overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were withdrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally demarcated in the Republican's favor.
The race in the new 17th kicked off with a campaign finance competition between the major parties' financial bones, the Democratic Campaign's Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb has become a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a nail-biting win in a widely watched special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The seat has been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump has won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The U.S. has considered penalizing El Salvador, rather than supporting China, but then retreated
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a cordial meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners expelled the Trump Organization's management team.
State department officials have decided to recall U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," department spokesman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But fines were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic aid.
The proposed fines, which include reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be difficult for the Central American country with its high unemployment and homicide rates.
As internal meetings progressed, only North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level congress and focused on security and economic progress to follow up on a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward in an effort to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
But by mid-September, top administration officials made it clear they wanted Congress to continue to effectively put an end to any consideration of fines for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to address the congress, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the seriousness of the convention for the administration, the diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new nasty messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberation on condition of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst who was close to the administration and also spoke about the condition of anonymity.
Studying the history
The next thing that could happen could be the special deliberation on Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible cross-examination of the court, of which there is now a lot of significant evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is also likely to focus his investigation on whether Mr. Trump's campaign has cooperated with Russia in the country's attack on our election.
Should Congress pass into other hands, Mr. Trump will face liability in that body, only when he prepares to go back before the electorate, and perhaps eventually before a jury of his peer group.
It’s a bunch of aces, and with that I don’t want to say that Mr. Trump’s fall is inevitable – and neither are those of his peers in Europe.
There are decisions that must be taken on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, which will affect how much the battle can be stretched.
In 1938, German officials were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, if the West only opposed him and supported the Czechoslovakia at Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the relentless course of democracy is accelerated or slowed down.
Americans are now facing a number of such turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein had been in hot water since this newspaper reported that he had proposed last year to take the president in secret and speculated about whether he was competent for his office.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times' report is inaccurate.
“How will we respond if Brett Kavanaugh’s newly requested FBI investigation is not complete or fair – or if he is upheld before the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and unfair testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we look at those tests, there is a long winter ahead for democracy.
But I don't think we will fail because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi government that once lived in my ambassador's house.
She survived, emigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to go light Sabbath candles on that table carrying the swastika.
With this as my origin, how can I not be an optimist about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistic about Rapid Vienna fight
Rangers play hosts for Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that victory over the Austrians, following the impressive tiebreak in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance from the season to the 2-2 tie against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers could use this result as a springboard for bigger things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
"We went into the game with the conviction that we could get something and walked away with a point.
Maybe we could have won it in the end, but an equal count is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came out in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday is another big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a difficult game because they had a good result in their last game, but with the crowd on our side, I'm sure we can push through and get a positive result.
"Last year was definitely tough, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes at the club, but there's now a feel-good factor in place.
The group is good and the men really enjoy it; the coaching is good.
"Hopefully we can now push through, sit behind us last season and be successful."
Women lose sleep over the fear of retirement savings.
Despite the fact that survey participants have a clear idea of how they want to be cared for, few people talk about it with their family members.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the steps to have the conversation," says Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide care if you don’t express your wishes well in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as those choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Introduce your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you come up with a way to pay for those expenses.
Your funding decisions for long-term care can include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid cash value life insurance policy to help cover these expenses, or self-insurance with your own assets – as long as you have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Cut out the right struts at the fit.
Get a health care proxy in place so that you appoint a trusted individual to take care of your medical care and ensure that experts meet your wishes if you can't communicate.
You'll also need to pay attention to your finances.
You need to choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid if you are unqualified.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to hospital.
Do you have any questions about allergies and medications?
Play out those details in a written plan so you're ready.
"It's not just the financial issues that are at stake, but who are the doctors?" Martin asked.
What's the medication?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make sure that plan is in place."
Man shot several times in Ilfracombe with windshield
A man was shot several times with a windshield when he walked home after an evening out.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which took place at around 02:30 BST, as a "random act."
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries were not life-threatening and the police asked for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
With communications out of action, emergency relief officials could not get any information from Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the center of the 7.5-circumference shaking.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were brought to safety after the disaster hit.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located on the tip of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit them.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the pillars of the Central Sulawesi Province's economy, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunami several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami caused more than 200 deaths and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996 and caused nine deaths.
Indonesia sits on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the great earthquakes and tsunami's of the past few years:
2004: A major earthquake along the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 that led to a tsunami that hit 14 countries led to 226,000 deaths along the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe shocks hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds have died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude south of Java, Indonesia was hit by the most populous island, leading to a tsunami hitting the southern coast and causing nearly 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude shot hit near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people have died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude quake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, which led to a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and led to about 300 deaths.
2016: A level shake hit the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh and led to destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly shake and tsunami in 2004.
This time it didn't lead to a tsunami, but more than 100 were killed because of buildings that collapsed.
2018: Major shocks hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, with more than 500 deaths, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The shooting destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of Alaska's former governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, has been arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released by Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he picked up a female acquaintance's phone from her when she called the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is being held at Mat-Su Pre-trial facility and is being held on a $500 uninsured bail, KTUU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared "innocent, definitely" when asked what he is pleading for, the network reported.
Palin faces three Class A violations, which means he can be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B offense, punishable by a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time there have been criminal charges against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending before Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference with the report of a crime of domestic violence, and possession of a firearm while drunk, in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he had punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son's behavior to PTSD as a result of his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake-tsunami: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake led to a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been out of action with mortality rates expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulate on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the beach.
Federal Prosecutors Seek Rare Death Sentence for Suspect in NYC Terrorist Attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people — a rare punishment that hasn’t been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan to mow down pedestrians and a cyclist who was in his path in October.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors will need to prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed the eight victims and "deliberately" inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of those defendants face possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury beat Saipov with 22 indictments, which included eight counts of murder for the sake of extortion, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a complaint of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "deep planning and consideration," prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried out it as "abhorrent, cruel and perverse."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, injury and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the Southern District of New York judicially prosecuted a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was finally sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were put to death after being convicted of a plot to carry out espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenberges were executed with the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he did, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charges.
He also requested to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal pro-Deo lawyers representing Saipov, said they were "naturally disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a life sentence with no possible release, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked persecutors not to desire the death penalty.
Tory LP says NIGEL FARAGE should be placed in control of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage has vowed to mobilize "the people's army" during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should feel the "heat" away from Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's own LPs suggested he should be in control of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backer Peter Bone told the Birmingham march that the UK would be "so out" by the time Mr Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the challenge facing Ms May to unite her deeply divided officers was signalled by pro-Roman Tories by joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister struggles to keep her Chequers compromise plan going amid attacks by Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Allies have insisted that she will push through in her attempt to reach a deal with Brussels despite the death toll – and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and “chaos.”
Mr. Bone told the Loop Signs Loop convention in Solihull that he wanted to "throw out Chequers".
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been made a nobleman and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in control, we would have been out of time," he said.
The Wellingborough LP added: "I will stand up for Brexit, but we have to throw out Chequers."
He explained his opposition to the EU, saying: "We have not fought world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone pointed out that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is completely untrue."
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also at the march and told reporters: ‘I just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“Chequers are unwilling with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unwilling with our party and our activists who are actually bombing the streets and making sure we are elected in the first place.
"Please let Chequers go and start listening."
In a direct message to Ms. May, she added: ‘Prime Ministers must keep their jobs when they keep their promises.’
Mr Farge said that the congress politicians "should have felt the heat" if they were on the threshold of wanting to violate the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"It's a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them ‘we won’t let you get away with it.’”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to let our political class, who is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
“We are mobilising the people’s army of this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will not rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a convention for two hours in the city centre.
A few activists have waved Tories against Brexit banners following the group's launch this weekend.
Labour leader Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives for the security issues they endured with a party application such as the conference opened.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus in place, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
“It’s an overall smart.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren Plans to ‘Look Hard’ to Stand for President
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she will look "hard to stand for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a city hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, stands for re-election in November against GOP leader Rep Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She is already in the midst of speculation that she may be going to challenge Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with constituents using the city hall format since Trump was in power.
A resident asked her if she planned to stand for president.
Warren responded that it was "time for women to go to Washington to get our broken government right, and that includes a woman very high."
Arrested in shooting death of LSU's Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, LA, announced on Saturday that a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayne Sims was arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying a man who was seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed early Friday near Southern University's campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and was eventually killed as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde stepped in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was on the scene, owned a gun, and admitted that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested at East Baton Rouge Parish police department.
A 6-foot-6 youth who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 leads last season and maintained an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebound balls per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton clinched world title after team orders gave him his win over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified Saturday ahead of Lewis Hamilton when Mercedes' team commands would play a major role in the races.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost won for Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered the pits first and left Hamilton to drive very far behind in the bundle in traffic, something that must have been decisive.
The Mercedes pitted a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton proceeded to wheel-to-wheel action that left the Ferrari driver reluctantly risk-free the inside view at risk of perseverance after a double-movement to defend on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the rear of the road jumper grid and was seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led for a large part of the races as he clung to his ties to finish quickly and pass Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He eventually entered the pits on the 44th round, but could not accelerate his pass in the remaining eight rounds as Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was said that it was a difficult day, because Valtteri did fantastic work all weekend and was a real gentleman.
The team has done an exceptional job to have a one-two," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a convention on Saturday over her insistence that she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which she accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
The president spoke at a convention in West Virginia and did not directly address the testimony Ford gave before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Instead, he commented that what was going on in the Senate showed people were "common and rude and liars."
"The one thing that can happen and the lovely thing that has happened in the Senate over the past few days, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and liars," he said.
"When you look at statements and leaks and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do that."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you ready?
Remember her answer... you leaked the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't lick it."
Well, wait a minute.
"No, we didn't," he said in a statement to the Senate.
Feinstein was sent the letter that outlined the allegations back in July against Kavanaugh by Ford, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak had come from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations. I didn't leak her story," Feinstein told the committee.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked."
But the president did not approve of her denial and commented during Saturday night's convention: "I'm telling you what. It was quite bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president went on to defend the Supreme Court nominee accused by three women of sexual misconduct and suggested that the Democrats use the allegations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back with any necessary means.
You see the community, the rudeness, they don't care who's hurting them, who they have to surround themselves with to get power and control," the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer has scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars reconciled for Friday's Elite League loss to the Belfast Giants by winning the match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got an early two-goal lead by throws from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led the home team before Dwyer regained the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard tied Dundee before two Lukas Lundvald Nielsen goals secured their victory.
It was the third Elite League win of the season for Adam Keefe's men who first lost matches and won 2-1 on Friday night in Belfast.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the sides, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's open ball came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from a Kendall McFaull assist, with David Rutherford providing the help when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening time, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the provider for Cownie's equaliser at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead until the first break in when he threw his second goal of the evening at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again equalled them with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game late in the second half and he made sure of winning with his team's fifth point halfway through the final half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are home to Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds on plane can escape earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered a hero after he died when he made sure a plane carrying hundreds of people safely took off.
More than 800 people have been killed and more are missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
There are still strong aftershocks in the area and many have been trapped in demolitions in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower that swung heavily at the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained motionless to make sure the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was able to safely take off.
He then jumped off the traffic control tower as he daydreamed it together.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We're heartbroken to hear this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands with the country's disaster relief agency saying access to the villages of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is restricted.
"It is believed that the death toll continues to rise as many bodies are still under construction while many cannot be reached," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves that have reached six meters have torn Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings in bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The miniatures are plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is chasing to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military service: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete every task related to evacuation.
"Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok earlier this year that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini says one man is now missing after seaside plane crash
The airline that handled a flight that crashed into a Pacific seaside lake in Micronesia says one man has now been missing after they said earlier that all 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they could not give an account of a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water as it tried to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, and that all of them were in stable condition.
The cause of the collapse and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane landed near the runway in the shore lake.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had passed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane arrived very low.
"It's a really good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to walk through mid-deep water to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendant panicked and screamed and suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said skeletons working close to improving a wharf also helped with the rescue by using an inflatable boat to get people back and forth ashore before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicate that 111 people have already died in the past two decades in crashes of PNG-registered airlines, but Air Niugini was involved in one.
Analysts set timeline of night that woman was burned alive
The state closed its case on Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cellphone records to gather the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of his death.
Rowlett said he had received location data from various phones that showed Tellis and Chambers were together on the night of her death, which contradicted his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the period he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to speak with Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's train that night, Sanford said he was "joking because my train was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency is that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Phone records indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis Chambers deleted messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He took her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing pleadings on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative outlook of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, of Bristol, claims that hip-hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and addressing social issues.
They want to go back to the foundations and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent revival in the UK by artists like Akala and Lowkey.
"Another black person?"
New York's child-rearing mother-in-law resigns because she was fired after 'racist' text
A New York midwife sues a couple for discriminatory resignation after she received a mis-addressed message from the mother who complained she was "still a black person."
The couple denies that they are racist and compares the matter with "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, cheered her up when she found out that the new childcare provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEEEE A BLACK PERSON," Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to me twice to Maurice.
After finding out her mistake, an "inconvenient" Plasco-Flaxman fired me at Maurice, saying that they were doing a bad job outgoing midwife who was African-American and that she was expecting a Filipino instead, according to the New York Post.
Me Maurice was paid for her one day's work and then sent home with an Uber.
Now, Maurice sues the couple for damages over the resignation and seeks his damages up to the amount of $350 per day for the six months, resident work for which she was initially appointed, even though it was without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you're not doing so well," she told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple backfired on the allegations of being racist, saying it was the reasonable thing to end Maurice's employment and fearing that they would not be able to trust her after they insulted her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist people," Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you put your children in the hands of someone you were rude to, even if it were by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the case to "extortion," saying his wife would have a baby in two months and was in a "very difficult situation."
"You're just going to leave a person behind?"
It's not a very nice thing to do," the investment banker added.
While the lawsuit was still going on, the court of public opinion had been quick to bring the couple on social media and cut them off for their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that a talking bear would not connect readers.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it's published.
It's very entertaining to know about Paddington's great success."
She said her father would have been fervent if his work had been rejected. He had been a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the children's book about the little toy bear. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release after his death last year was "bitterly sweet".
About Paddington, whom she described as a "very important member of our family," she added that her father was quietly proud of his ultimate success.
"He was quite a quiet man and he wasn't an apple-loving man," she said.
"But because Paddington was genuine to him, it was almost like having a child who achieved something: you're proud of them, even if it's not your job.
I think he thought Paddington's success was kind of like that.
Even if it was his creation and imagination, he always gave the honour to Paddington himself."
My daughter was about to die and I had to say hello on the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was rushed to Nice's Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it was sadly bad, that they didn't expect her to make it," said Ms Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got the call from Nad to say that she would die within the next two minutes and that I should have greeted her.
And I did.
"I said, 'Tashi, I love you very much, Hartlam.
I'll be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The medicine that the doctors gave her to keep her heart beating was slowly touching up and leaving her system.
She was dead for a while and the body was about to close.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that this was unfolding.
I couldn't bark or cry or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to pull it off."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who by that time was hurt by the loss of her daughter, went on board the plane with the other passengers - unaware of the ordeal she had gone.
"Nobody knew," she said.
"I had my head down and the tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I got an overwhelmingly sympathetic feeling for Nad on the run.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Sad Women Post Cards to Prevent Suicide on Bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been posting cards for a while on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Me Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he started leading to depression and killed himself at 18.
"I don't want a parent to feel like I feel every day," she said.
Me Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and said her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that her smile made any departure clear."
However, he gave up work before he died, because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he took his own life.
Me Davis said: "I'm constantly concerned that there's going to be a domino effect."
Me Davis designed the maps, "to let people know that there are people out there who you can go to and talk to, even if they're a friend.
"Don't be silent, you have to talk."
Me Humphreys, who has been a friend of Me Davies for years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old husband, not long after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt sick or depressed or anything," she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He reached the very lowest point on Christmas Day - when the children opened their gifts, he didn't make eye contact or anything with them."
She said his death had been very traumatic for them, but that they had to work through it: "There's a hole through the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to go and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still undecided as FBI investigation begins
"I thought if we could actually get something like what he asked for - a timeless investigation that didn't have any cuts - we might be able to bring some unity," Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "falling apart" under austere partisan agitation.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters have to set up an FBI investigation?
They're all about the timing.
The midterm elections are only weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans do not fare well, then they will be greatly weakened in their efforts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush calls on senators to influence them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House and who, through him, met his wife Ashley and was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are present.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes on the Senate floor that will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break a tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea to 'downgrade' numbers under Kim
The number of North Korean runners to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug cited data from the South's unification cabinet, saying there were 1,127 overruns last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates demanded by human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of North Koreans are finally being offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protective demilitarized zone (DMS) between the two Koreas.
China considers the invaders as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them by force.
Relations between the North and the South - who are still technically at war with each other - have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks centered around the staggering nuclear arms removal negotiations.
It came after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore when they agreed in broad terms to work together for the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho on Saturday blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without any trust in the U.S., there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first," Ri said in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysteries," says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
House minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh "hysteries" and said he was temperamentally unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi gave the comment Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman ever acted like this, they would say 'hysteria'," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied emotional allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional and at times almost screamed and sighed as he discussed his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly rejected Democrats on the committee and called the allegations against him a "ridiculous and coordinated character slur" organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it showed he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he's incompetent with those statements and the way he went behind the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi was hesitant when asked if she would try to appeal to Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if Democrats won the majority in the House of Commons.
"I will say this - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not competent to be in the Supreme Court, but to be in the court he's in right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Ommegang Appellate Court.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade as he is considered a conservative right.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh skipped questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'It's not wonderful,'" Pelosi said.
And women have to deal with it.
It's a righteous diatribe, months and years of anger that overcooks, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive officer somewhere, who also said that she was crying when she became angry, but developed a technique that meant that when she became angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, 'You think I'm hooked.
I'm angry."
And then she just started.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are permissible as a partial exit for tomato because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my sharpest memories of an early job in a male-dominated office is where I once found myself crying with nameless anger and caught at my neck by an older woman - a cold driver I was a little afraid of - who dragged me into a report.
"Don't ever let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they've had an impact on you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and he had to leave the races, Schroeder, very frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she could not investigate the idea that she could run for president.
"I didn't think well of the decision," she told me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind with fundraisers and so she made a vow not to enter the races unless she raised $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that of her supporters who gave men $1,000 would only give her $250.
"Do they think I'm going to get fired?" she asked.
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not be launching a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed by emotions - grateful for the people who supported her, frustrated with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than delegates, and angry at the sexism - that she hated.
You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalled about how the press had reacted to her.
"You would have thought that Kleenex was my corporate guarantor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my gravestone?
"She's crying?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The opening salvo of the U.S.-China trade war had been overwhelming and while the battle is far from over, a disagreement between the countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the U.S. president, fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most interesting escalation this week rolled in with new tariffs affecting $200 trillion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 trillion) of items and effectively taxing half of the goods entering the US from China.
Beijing has been reversing goods every time and has recently slashed tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has promised to equate the U.S. shot-by-shot and the world's largest economy is not going to move anytime soon.
To get Washington to stand back means to surrender to requests, but to publicly comply with U.S. requests would be too much of a embarrassment to Xi Jinping, China's president.
Experts still say that if Beijing plays its cards right, pressure over U.S. trade war over the long term can positively support China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create the conditions that could trigger an economic toll flight in any of the countries is actually far more dangerous than spectators have previously admitted," said Abigail Grace, a research assistant focusing on Asia at the center of New American Security.
Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by a war for more than seven years.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, the situation at ground level is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists to normal.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that targeted their daily lives and their existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need philanthropic assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the low-lying country.
But he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that had secured the invasion.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup and Team USA won with a final point of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored the 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for most of the tournament, blew his T-shirt into the water at the par-3 16th hole and conceded his game to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has blossomed in all of his rounds and has become one of the 1-of-4 players to ever go 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was blown out 5&4 by the player with the lowest rank on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The player with the world's highest rank, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to land Poulter of England who may have played in his final Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, has become the tournament's all-time European winner with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a rough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He handed over the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who beat U.S. golfer Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single game on Sunday.
The incredible pride that I feel, to win Tiger Woods, I grew up and looked at that old woman," Rahm, 23, said.
Woods has already lost four of his games in France and now holds a 13-21-3 career Ryder Cup record.
A strange statistic by one of the greatest players of all time and he won 14 major titles second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to find the clean field with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
US captain Jim Furyk spoke after a disappointing performance on behalf of his team: "I'm proud of these guys. They fought.
It's been a while since we've had a little bit of heat in Europe.
We've scraped it.
Take care of Thomas.
He's a wonderful captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup. I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to serve as their captain.
You have to keep your hat on.
We're overrated."
