The triumph of right-wing populists in Austria: in total they have 29%
The noticeable weakening of both existing parties in the grand coalition and this marked strengthening of right-wing populist parties led, according to preliminary results, to early parliamentary elections on Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (<0xC3><0x96>VP), within which the position of the current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously vacillating, has suffered particularly strong losses.
On the contrary, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZ<0xC3><0x96>), the deputy prefect of Kärnten Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphant return to national politics.
According to the provisional results, the strongest party in the country remains the Social Democratic Party (SP<0xC3><0x96>) with 29.8% of the vote, compared to the last elections of 2006, but loses 5.5%.
Even worse it went for <0xC3><0x96>VP, which loses with 25.6% almost 9% of the votes.
These are the worst results of these two great parties in post-war Austrian history and above all the literally catastrophic result of the popular, which provoked early elections.
Back in early July, when the <0xC3><0x96>VP left the coalition, the populars had a considerable advantage over SP<0xC3><0x96> in preferences.
But the voters obviously punished them because they had the government sink.
Already in the first reactions to the results there was speculation about the possible resignation of the party president, Vice-Chancellor Wilhelm Monterer.
Observers believe that it could already take place on Monday during the extraordinary convocation of the party leadership.
This development should perhaps facilitate the path towards the increasingly likely way out of the election result, i.e. towards the renewal of the SP<0xC3><0x96> and <0xC3><0x96>VP coalition.
Regarding the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties -the liberals (FP<0xC3><0x96>) gained early 18% and the BZ<0xC3><0x96> 11% votes- but the socio-democrats at the same time revealed the concern of another 1999, when the populists agreed with the people's party to the collective government.
On this evolution obviously plays Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party and assumes a return to Vienna in national politics.
The Green Party also managed to enter the parliament, but it fell slightly, falling between the Austrian political parties from third to fifth place.
No other party has obviously exceeded the 4% threshold and has not entered Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool down
If the problem with Czech scientists who have been accused of illegally harvesting beetles in India cannot be solved, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said there would be some cooling in Czech-Indian relations.
The Minister mentioned this in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If it is not resolved, then there will be a certain cooling," he noted after the meeting that took place under the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said after the negotiations that the executive power can hardly interfere in legal affairs.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>v<0xC3><0xA1>cha, who was acquitted by the indictment and punished with a fine, the central government can negotiate with the local government in Dardjeeling which falls under his jurisdiction.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
According to Mukherjee, it would be better for Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, sentenced to three years in prison, to resort to a higher court.
Then he can ask for his release on bail and wait for the sentence to be released.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed the same during the negotiations.
"Recommend the appeal to the Supreme Court then it will be possible to obtain the grace," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can get into the matter is to provide the convicts with "competent legal aid," the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that such support is already being provided by the Indian side.
“We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations that have been handed over to India for many years.
The Indians admit it too," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told <0xC4><0x8C>TK, he stressed before his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
“We really consider it a profound mistake to incarcerate and accuse these Czech scientists,” he said.
The minister avoided answering the question of whether he got from the Indian side the promise to take care of the matter.
"I've got relatively many promises," he just noted.
A Czech judge in the battle for the seabed
It approaches the electronic map on the wall on which Australia and the adjacent marine areas are drawn.
But it is not interested in the continent but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
“The island belongs to Australia and with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself, says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of a team of 33 workers from the UN Division for Oceans and Maritime Rights issues.
His boss, the Czech lawyer director of the Division, V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Mikulka, is following his exposition and occasionally adds something.
It dominates the desire to work and enthusiasm.
The seabed still hides a little known world rich in natural resources.
It is possible to find oil, metallic minerals and other mineral materials, but also living organisms unknown until now that carry within themselves the key to the discovery of medicine against cancer.
The largest bottom of the mainland
The coastal states began to lend interest to the underwater territory.
According to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCLOS), they take advantage of the laws they agreed on in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf that often extends up to several hundred kilometers from the coast of the state in question.
It has an exclusive right under the Convention to all resources of the continental shelf.
In a nutshell, continental shelf means that part of the seabed and its subsoil that is a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
The so-called exclusive economic zone extends beyond the territorial sea often over 200 nautical miles,” Mikulka explains.
The request for which the country submits to the commission for the definition of the size of the continental shelf must be accompanied by a very broad technical-scientific documentation based on many expensive surveys and measurements.
This is the result of many years of preparation.
“One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical-professional assistance to the commission.
The Commission has so far dealt with 5 requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three nominations were successful,” Mikulka adds.
Australia’s recent success, which has greatly expanded its marine holdings, has recorded a worldwide resonance.
But also New Zealand has earned us - the surface of the seabed, which was assigned to it by the commission last week, of about 1.6 square kilometers so more or less six times larger than the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profit that they will reap in the future from the seabed, as they promise, will be invaluable.
Other states will also gradually submit their requests.
They can do so for ten years since the “Montego Bay Convention” was ratified.
Where the continental shelf ends begins the ocean floor area that the convention has declared a common heritage of humanity.
No state has an exclusive position now.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by this international institution established by the Convention.
"But the Seabed is not Klondike," says Director Mikulka exaggerating, "with its individual parts being legally demarcated and their regime contractually established."
Czechs in the Pacific
A part of the seabed now also belongs to the Czech Republic.
If he divides it with other states of the former Soviet bloc within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This acquired in 1991 under the convention, as well as investors from a few other states, the status of the so-called "pioneer investor".
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean extended between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor and slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is tangled, it is an almost underwater replica of Tatry.
"It is possible to extract on the total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich deposit of polymetallic agglomerates containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," another Indian lawyer, Pakshi Rajan, said in a statement.
A worker from the Macedonian division Rober Sandev brings with him a find to show it.
It looks like a small potato or with a bit of fantasy, a legendary scheme, as in the legend of the awakening of the Golem.
German special forces were present at the release of the hostages.
The Egyptian government had asked for help from Germany for the release of the hostages – experts then arrived.
When the situation became critical, the special units were ready, but they did not intervene.
More and more detailed information is coming to us about the circumstances of the release of the 11 European hostages kidnapped.
On the rescue operation, the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior mentioned, German special units took part.
In addition to the army specialists, the GSG9 units, the Federal Avian Police, the Federal Criminal Office, as well as the logistics experts of the technical institution were present on site.
As the spokesman of the ministries said on Monday evening, the German units did not intervene because the hijackers, given the danger of a force intervention, released the hostages on the run.
The Egyptian government accepted the aid offered by the Germans, to join as assistance directly on the spot.
“We didn’t get there by luck,” says a spokesman for the interior ministry.
Attackers kidnapped a group of travelers on September 19 in southern Egypt: 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian escorts.
After the kidnapping in a deserted area in southern Egypt, the hostages were deported to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers to the end remained secret as well as details of the release or possible ransom payments.
In the meantime, the liberated have arrived in Cairo in good condition.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages are under the protection of the German embassy.
The details of the release have not been explained.
There was no information in Berlin as to when they would return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild" the 5 holidaymakers and special units should depart in flight with an Airbus of the military aviation and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejects the bailout package.
The first chamber of Congress has just failed the $700 billion bailout package for financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell down.
With 206 votes to 227, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s bailout package for financial markets.
Despite the appeals of US President George W. Bush and leading politicians from both parties, there had been no majority for the program, which would have had to curb the chaos of the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, supporters have desperately tried to persuade critics from the heavy $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the negotiations, urged MPs to agree, even though the plan was unpopular.
8. It is difficult to have gratitude to avoid something that has not yet arrived..
While the vote was underway, the Dow Jones fell more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The reason for investors’ concerns was that the state bailout could have failed.
It resumed before the end of the vote and then, after the announcement of failure, collapsed again.
Experts now expect further serious turbulence in international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, it must be approved by both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate.
Promoters register increasing numbers of bookings
It looks like it will be a good winter for German tour operators:
According to a study, the turnover on travel bookings for the coming months compared to the previous year has increased significantly - for the winter season even by more than 30%.
Despite weak views of the economy, the willingness of the Germans to travel according to an investigation remains strong.
On bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a 31% increase in turnover compared to the same period of the previous year, as the German tourism association DRV announced on Monday in Berlin.
According to the survey of the market research institute GfK there are increased booking quotas even for the autumn months.
Thus, the surplus of travel agencies for October compared to 2007 would amount to about 11%, the DRV said.
Assuming these results are the figures of the GfK, which monthly analyzes the booking data of 1,200 German travel agencies and develops statistical projections for the entire market.
Travel bookings made until the end of August 2008 would also be included.
Due to the weak price of the dollar, trips to the United States in particular would be required, the DRV reported.
Here the increase in reservations would amount to about a third.
They would also be particularly popular destinations with Germans in Spain, Turkey, Greece, as well as locations within Germany.
Above all, all-inclusive travel has a high rating, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
Considering the rising costs for energy and food, the costs in this case would be "better computable for customers than for an individually organized holiday".
Consumers could save money through, among other things, discounts for bookings made in advance or offers with everything included, Laepple explained.
Even the summer months would have recorded excellent booking figures, so much so that a turnover surplus would have been recorded again compared to the year before - although according to a further study the number of Germans who undertook a trip,compared to the previous year has fallen.
My first time at the Oktoberfest
Hits by Ballermann, beer from one liter mouthpieces and vip in Dirndln griffati.
A debut at Wiesn
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She is a blonde, TV moderator and wears a custom Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is second-hand.
But one thing we have in common: just 3 minutes at the Wiesn, already the photographers throw themselves against us and take pictures until the memory of the cameras fills – very flattering, and this on my first visit to the Wiesn.
That's how you make friends
The two-money dirndl seems to achieve its goal.
As a tourist of the Wiesn and actually resident north of the white sausage equator, the sense of well-being in costume/dressing is still kept within limits.
But once you get to the Theresienwiese, it's nothing serious.
Almost everyone wears Dirndl or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed – all perfectly normal.
Only the apron of my Dirndl collects strange looks at the chocolate banana stand.
A monk reminds me that I would have tied my apron in the wrong way: "On the left you are free, on the center you are virgin, on the right you are busy, behind widow."
Suddenly I'm fixing my bow from the back to the left.
All right,” he says and laughs.
Others make less waste of subtle flirting techniques and wear sober felt hats, on which he heads "To drunk to get dressed!" and stretch his back bare against an uninvited.
The boy with exhibitionist inclinations is called Bob, he comes from England and he also visits the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a scratched "oooooo"..
This tells me, after he got rid of his mouthful of beer from a litre drunk before.
Right next to one of these hydrators, which everyone thinks is a patisserie.
Bob is one of those infamous "Wildbieslers".
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around 8 o’clock in the evening, the sanitary workers walk in a pack on the square of the party, who have to take care of the poor bees
The nurses appear every time in the pack – always 4 at a time dragging a covered bar of tent to tent.
This works as with most visitors to the Wiesn: you go empty, you come back full.
Who lies under the tarpaulin in this blood alcohol casket, you can't see.
"Des sind die, wos goarnimmer packn", shouts one of the sanitary and disappears into the baronda.
Victim of an accident identified by police
A 63-year-old woman who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle while walking in Essex has been identified.
Carole Paulson, of Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the incident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but died shortly thereafter.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on the charge of inattentive driving.
He was released on bail.
Turkey is broadening its diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey tried to enter the European Union, the European powers were anxious to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 steps in Asia, lies one of the most beautiful relics of this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
This is at least what the tour guides tell you.
The building stands amidst the end of the platforms with a tower on each of its corners looking at the world like some German provincial municipalities.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is slightly declining.
But once inside the ticket office from the vaulted ceiling, there is no doubt about the size of the enterprise of what was the westernmost passage.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a retard of the imperial game, wanted to realize its ambitions to dominate the Middle East through this railway that ran to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond in what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany’s imperial ambitions sank during the First World War.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
The relative isolation from the surrounding region, generated by the icy borders of the Cold War, has passed
British and dominant forces advanced out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was bad news for Hyderpasha station, too.
In 1917 a munitions train exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then it has been slowly disintegrating, far surpassed by history.
But today, this railway outlet for Anatolia and all points to the east, serve - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's ever-greater diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party - the AKP - has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from its surrounding regions, generated by the icy borders of the Cold War, has passed.
Now there is a new policy of commitment.
Notably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To estimate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I embarked on the sleeping wagon for the Turkish capital Ankara, to visit one of the AKP's leading foreign policy experts, Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning – about ten and a half hours later – after a bouncer race along the tracks that produced the ancient world chains of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital – proposed as a new city for a centuries-old state intent on turning its back on its Ottoman past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots represents an exemplary shift in Turkish consensus.
He suggested some suspicions in the West, most notably in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel – built ad hoc – in a developing suburb, surrounded by built-up media malls and power bakeries, where managers in full-time businesses – both men and women – meet to make early-morning contracts.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a center-right politician from almost every other political party in Europe.
Complete, tie, I'm sure he also had a Blackberry.
“The purpose of the foreign policy party now is to reintegrate Turkey with its closest neighbors.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he tells me.
Turkey has been cut off from its hinterland.
Today it has to look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't the case for either of them.
They must be both.
"But certainly at some point," I ask, "will Turkey be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he says, "doesn't want where to face that choice."
Then he points out a point that almost everyone I have spoken to here has memorized: the ties of not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus, and all around the Black Sea, are as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, the whole of Europe can metaphorically traverse those railway lines eastward through Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha station, after another blank night, I think of those two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who had looked at this building built 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to find that Europe's Middle East ambitions can now be largely in Turkey's hands.
And while I wait at the terminal for the ferry that takes me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe".
At least then there seemed to be no doubt as to which continent to make claims to this fascinating country.
Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrology, September 11) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the choir.
As a member of his music scheme for the municipality, the following year he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus.
They were supposed to be under 21/ under 21, but by the time the Proteus sang its finale in 1979, many of us were over twenty – we simply refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being-moving) represented the goodwill of the choir and the ability to deal with everything that the music presented to do, whether madrigal or Messiaen, without accompaniment or with the whole orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often astonishing, always exciting, and it was all because of the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
How often we were told by Tod to “let the music speak for itself.”
He said, “The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
Sing it!"
His technique in using the wand was absolutely clear and precise, though never dictatorial or flowery.
Whatever the musical standard, it made it more and more elevated.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If you were to appoint a knight as a conductor, it would be Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades in which he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years and more I’ve watched more than 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I’ve never disagreed with just one of them – and many times inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of personal greatness and modesty.
He hated orchestral conductors who, in his words, simply "rided around the world one or two well-known battlehorses".
He will be missed by so many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary of William Woodruff (25 September) specifies that "in 1946 he resumed studying economic history at Oxford and in 1950 he became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... studying at the same time for a degree in science, one in letters and a PhD".
This follows from Woodruff's note in Beyond Nab End, but is not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which time he completed a PhD thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He spent 1950-51 in the United States as a researcher at Houblon-Norman, and in the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham permanently for Illinois.
Why Woodruff chose to cover this part of his career, we don't know.
J. Vincent Resino at the Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco y vida", because his black and white photographs, in documentary style, are extraordinary.
They have drawn my attention to the simplicity and strength they convey, while treating the protagonists with particular respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feeling.
Resino manages to capture magical moments."
Second assault for Honda oversold
In November, Honda will launch the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the previous model was already equipped with great habitability, this new minivan has an even wider interior space.
All this is accompanied by a refined mechanics, which increases driving comfort and saves fuel.
Evolution against revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz has a line very similar to that of the previous model, the changes in this minivan are numerous.
Among other things, it is worth noting an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before proceeding to analyze the new model, it is useful to note that this new Jazz comes six years after entering the market of the first generation.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda renewed this model in a shorter time than those used by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe the Jazz model is less well known than in other markets, it remains a unique phenomenon in terms of sales.
This is exactly the case in Japan, where Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
In Japan, almost one million units of Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The second market was that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
Despite these numbers, Honda believes that the new Jazz will increase sales in the segment.
Thus, if in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of this model, for 2009 estimates are around 100,000 cars, assuming a 17% increase in sales in the European market.
As for the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 units of Jazz since 2002, which corresponds to 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, those responsible for the Spanish branch expect to sell around 2,000 units of Jazz over the course of a year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to reduce sales in Spain to a good extent.
In fact, the company’s managers plan to reach the end of the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, or 4,000 fewer than in 2007, with a 16% drop.
Despite the increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain to 1.8%, up from 1.6% last year.
In addition, the Japanese company expects to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this, Honda is confident in the arrival of another new model.
This is Insight, a compact, five-door hybrid - 4.37 meters long - of which the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200,000 units a year worldwide.
For markets and according to estimates made by the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight's sales will take place in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is planned for the first months of the year, immediately after the company's presentation in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has grown in all its parts.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the span 2.50 meters, with an increase of five centimeters.
The height, however, remained unchanged at 1.52 meters.
Together with the increase in size, it also expands the living interior.
This advantage comes on the one hand from the introduction of a new platform, and on the other hand from the introduction of the fuel tank in a central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz model.
In addition, the capacity of the trunk – equipped with a double background – rises to 399 liters, that is, 19 liters more than the capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these are the measurements of the 1.4 engine version, and that the luggage compartment capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements, such as the rear LEDs or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - concern an improvement in accessibility to the rear seats.
The doors that allow access to the rear positions, in fact, open with an angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
In addition, the engines in this second generation of jazz are also new.
At the time of commercialization, this small model will be proposed in models with 1.2 and 1.4 liter petrol engine.
Both mechanics include i-VTEC technology that allows you to lower fuel consumption, produce less carbon dioxide emissions, optimize the mechanics and at the same time keep the engine torque high in all its phases.
The 1.2-litre model offers a power output of 90 hp at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm. at 4,900 rpm.
The propulsion – which in the previous Jazz reached 78 hp – uses 5.3 liters of fuel and produces CO2 emissions equal to about 125 grams.
Compared to the previous propulsion, which in the first generation model used 83 horses, now there are 100 available.
The Jazz 1.4 100 horsepower reaches a combination of 5.4 liters of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 emitted.
The "bee car" to avoid collisions
As part of the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan has been inspired, this time, by nature, and in particular by bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, for example, by taking the flight of bees, knows how to avoid accidents.
It is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which is the first step towards collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technical Center developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Scientific and Technological Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Brand Management Research and Development, the BR23C is an extension of Nissan’s four-area Security Shield.
This robot is intended to improve the ability to prevent collisions in the vehicles of the manufacturer.
During the flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space that is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important thing is the composite eyes of the bees, able to see in all directions with an angle of more than 300 degrees, and which allow the insect to fly without interruption in its personal space.
To recreate this visual feature, the engineers developed what they called a laser range finder.
This mechanism detects obstacles in front of the BR23C for a radius within two meters and with a maximum amplitude of 180 degrees, calculates the distance from the object and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor that immediately prevents collision.
“The moment it detects an obstacle, the small robot mimics the movements of a bee and immediately changes direction by turning on the wheels at right angles or greater to avoid collision.
The most obvious difference with any assisted system is that the evasion maneuver is totally instinctive.
“If this were not the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot deviate upwards or downwards, or even diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction in which it can rotate its wheels and not taking advantage of infinite directions and ways as bees do.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotation function, as well as acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid collisions.
“This device just needs to process the information every few seconds, and act on that data.
It does not require the storage of information or the intuitive logic of previous maneuvers, so it can work without interruption and with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This may come as a surprise, but we’re not talking about gigabytes of memory, or even mega.”
It is the first step towards the development of new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology that Nissan hopes will be standard in cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than the lithium-ion type.
Another potential future application of this technology could be the integration of the units with a GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to the destination avoiding obstacles present in the route.
Tremble before applying for a loan
We must recognize that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to having a lot of capital to intervene, is certainly not without ingenuity.
Faced with the crisis and to prevent Americans from engaging with junk mortgages in dubious insolvency banks, they have created a fun and instructive game for users of the network: "Bad Credit Hotel".
In other words, the "Hotel of bad credits"...or problems.
The dark aspect of this accommodation and, in particular, of its receptionist serves to induce you to think not one, but two or even three times before applying for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it, which is probably the primary goal.
Of course, the information that the game provides is useful, but it is not detailed.
It’s more of a teenage page than a site for the general public.
What happens if you complete the game?
Well, compare a song room inside the hotel.
It is still something, because to buy a better house does not even speak...
Morgan Stanley opens its capital at MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced the signing of an agreement with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, which will invest $9 billion in a 21% stake in the Company, news received following a sharp decline in its stock market shares.
A week after the drafting of a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s shares at an individual cost of $25.25, or a sum of $3 billion.
The established price is 19% lower than the book value of the securities at 31 August.
MUFG will also invest $6 billion in the purchase of convertible securities at a conversion price of $31.25, ensuring a return of 10%.
Morgan Stanley said the global transaction would be based on an average price of $29 per share, which is less than its current price of 28%.
At 5 p.m., Morgan Stanley dropped 6.79% to $23.07.
“This strategic alliance represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to a bank holding company,” said John Mack, CEO of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow it to differentiate its shares, but put them under the control of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with the MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street’s biggest names to adopt a much more prudent attitude than previously assumed.
The terms set out on Monday also show that the deal has been changed in recent days: Last Monday, Morgan had simply announced the sale of 20% of its shares to the Japanese giant for a sum of $8.5 billion.
A week ago, in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno, MUFG’s executive director, explained: “We thought that our shareholding would be composed exclusively of ordinary shares.
But given the current situation of the world economy and the market, we have chosen to minimize risks and protect ourselves.”
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will obtain Morgan Stanley securities at a price below their accounting value of 7%.
And the transaction would result in an investment of at least 20% of the equity on a diluted basis.”
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares in a year if, over a given period, the latter are traded more than 50% below the fixed conversion price, i.e. at about $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital provided by MUFG would allow it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its budget and increase its liquidity.
A spokesman for the group, however, declined to provide clarification on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley is therefore expected to set a Tier One solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said it had "clearly" lightened its budget from the end of August.
The last few weeks have put the group to the test, which has seen the value of its shares halve while the cost of insurance against risks has undergone a surge.
Cost that refluxed on Monday, but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other “survivor” among Wall Street’s major investment banks after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, announced it had raised $15 billion, partly from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
Establishing the republic on a socialism in the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, Bolivian Evo Morales et Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
On Sunday, following the example of colleagues and friends, it was the latter who gave voice to the draft of a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since, according to the official results, 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, on a basis of votes equal to 80%.
According to these results, the "no" was 28%, while 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% white cards.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it should get half the votes, plus one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the exit of the polls and an estimate by a non-governmental organization had announced an overwhelming victory of the "yes", placing it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed the victory of his draft Constitution on Sunday and Monday.
The “Constitution triumphed gloriously,” he assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians within the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As always, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez and Morales congratulated Rafael Correa, as did his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The poll, which was conducted in a calm manner according to the election observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), was based on a 444-point text to consolidate the "new socialism" defended by the president.
This draft Constitution enshrines the power of the state over the economy, reserving it the "development planning" of a country that lives essentially on the oil extraction implemented by large foreign companies and consequently on their currency.
Conceived by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also gives more power to the head of state, who can be elected for two consecutive four-year terms, to have the opportunity to dissolve the assembly.
Correa has already announced its intention to take advantage of this amendment and to re-appoint its candidacy for a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution also affirms the gratuitousness of health and education services, which the president has begun to promote in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It also prohibits the presence of foreign troops, a provision that will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the assault on the abductors of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts kidnapped ten days ago.
I'm in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts held captive in the desert for ten days were returned to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon, safe and sound.
In the morning, they were liberated in Chad by an Egyptian commando.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived at the military base of Almaza, near the Cairo International Airport, around 15 and 30, aboard a special plane.
On board a helicopter, they were transferred immediately, without being able to give any interviews to the press, to the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, for analysis.
They enjoy "good health" and no ransom has been paid "to the kidnappers," Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said on the runway.
Kidnapped on September 19 during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, bordering Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been toppled from one hiding place to another by 35 unknown hijackers.
The group consisted of 11 tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and 8 Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptous, the organizing agency of the safari.
An Egyptian security official said that 30 members of the special forces, aboard two helicopters, had launched the assault during the night, just before dawn.
"There have been shootings, half of the kidnappers have been killed, while the others have fled," said the official who asked to remain anonymous.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "lamp" unit were sent to Sudan, where they would be supported by German and Italian commandos.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini stressed from Belgrade the importance of the role of Italian secret agents and special forces.
We have to admit that if we achieved this result it was thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of the men of our secret services, the special forces," he said, without adding further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese patrol army had claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on which the hijackers were located and to have killed six of them, including the Chadian leader of the hijackers, and to have captured two of them.
According to the army, the kidnappers were linked to a Darfur rebel organization, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA_U), an assertion immediately denied by the latter.
Letters – The Silent Majority of Culture
On the first page a debate on the financing of culture on which the current electoral campaign focuses.
All the better.
But a part of our cultural life is always in the shadows.
Who will speak out to denounce the miserable sums granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical places that make hunger?
Which politician will dare remind the federal government that it is ignoring monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we have no real laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government is paying three and a half million euros for the restoration of the Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
In our American neighbors, it is the Constitution that affirms that the protection of heritage is part of national culture and that the same heritage must be protected by every citizen, every political authority and every government department, and all this by common accord.
In Quebec, at the Federation of Historic Societies of Quebec, there are at least 40,000 volunteers who, grouped into 211 societies for the protection of the historical, genealogical, archives and heritage assets preserve, with four money, private archives and archaeological sites.
It is they who often defend our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when real estate entrepreneurs and decision-makers attack with their bulldozers our forgotten remains and cemeteries.
When will the right space be reserved for history and heritage?
Benelux Governments Nationalize Part of Fortis Bank
The Benelux states are helping through partial nationalization the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which ended up in difficulties for the first time in Europe for the crisis of the American credit market: the three nations will provide 11.2 billion euros to the financial institution - insurance with interest also in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands agreed at the highest level over the weekend, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the difficulties in which the international financial market has been debated for more than a year is that of Fortis Bank, and from a certain point of view the decisions taken in this regard can set a precedent.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states will hold almost half (49%) of the bank’s share in the country.
The bank will almost certainly sell some of its interests, including first of all the assets, especially insurance, of the Dutch ABN Amro acquired a year ago.
Last week, Fortis’s actions had begun with a vertical collapse, with serious signs of the institution’s crisis appearing later in the second half of the week.
Analysts, however, agree that the bank, with 85,000 employees, is too large to allow it to go bankrupt.
The bank’s shares fell nearly 12% on Friday, the lowest point in 14 years.
Since January, the value of shares has decreased by more than two-thirds.
Considering the current share prices, the entire capital value of the group is around 14 billion euros, but according to the bank's executives this value is not real.
The corporate summit blames the collapse of Fortis shares on the uncertainty of the non-European market due to the acceptance of the US $700 billion plan.
On Monday, the title slowly rebounded.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed new CEO of the bank.
The financial institution has also been looking for private buyers but so far no one has come forward with a deserving offer.
The Belgian government had previously assured investors that they should not be afraid of losing money.
There was no panic among the bank’s customers, and the branches were not attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis owns autonomous subsidiaries and has also acquired leasing companies.
The fox in the chicken coop
In America, life and health insurers, based on people’s medical purchase data, often refuse to enter into an insurance contract.
Privacy experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a privacy program according to which the use of prescription drug data depends in any case on the approval of the person concerned.
This program must be in independent hands, otherwise it’s like entrusting the chicken coop to the fox,” writes the Washington Post citing Richard Dick, author of the program to follow the prescriptions of medicines.
Insurance companies subordinate the insurance rate and the amount due in case of claims to the health status of the potential customer and if they consider the risk too high they do not take out insurance.
Some time ago the client had to undergo a medical visit and the contract was concluded only after the result of the examination.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure 10 years ago: based on the customer's identification code, you can easily get information from pharmacies about which medicines he has bought in the last year and a half, and from this the program reveals what diseases he suffers and what health conditions he is in.
For example, if you regularly buy large amounts of cholesterol reducers this means that the level of fat in the blood is practically incurably high and is classified in the highest risk category.
There are various versions of the program on the market, some also determine the risk multiplier, so the insurer in addition to paper work does not remain much, even if there are small difficulties.
Among the drawbacks is that some medications are usable for multiple purposes, e.g. some compounds are usable against migraines or hot flashes, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter, from the point of view of insurance - commercial, is valid as a risk factor, the first two are not.
For the request and processing of data, separate companies have been formed and these, before obtaining the necessary information from pharmacies, ask for the approval of the patient.
The authorities are now obliging them to do so even though they have not imposed fines for negligence so far.
Some companies have also recently processed the results of laboratory tests and linked them to drug consumption data in order to provide a more accurate picture of patients’ health status.
More and more companies have access to data and at the same time control of usage will be increasingly difficult.
There is a separate privacy law but its validity extends only to health services and insurance.
Before Congress there is a bill that gives the authorities control competence to companies specialized in data service.
Richard Dick admits that it is not enough: for this he has developed a program that links the transmission of data with the express approval of the person concerned.
Another issue is that the person concerned cannot so much deny the approval because otherwise the insurers do not enter into the contract.
So then in the end the hens are entrusted to the clemency of the fox.
Menu marsigliano global
The European Union and India are doubling trade
Since the European Union and India are partners that trade mainly with each other, the agenda of the ninth summit was also dominated by this issue, in addition to all other global problems.
Today there will be a Franco-Indian summit that will deal primarily with cooperation on nuclear energy.
The European Union recognises that India is becoming a major democratic power to which it should give more voice in international affairs, but member countries have not yet been able to decide whether or not to support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
So we did not insist on this issue at the ninth summit held yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as the EU's acting president, José Manuel Barroso, chairman of the Commission, and Javier Solana, High Representative for Foreign Affairs, have received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they have reached an agreement to double trade in 5 years, i.e. to increase it to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion.
Considering that trade in goods has increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not an overly ambitious goal.
As a result, the 26 bilateral civil aviation agreements have been legally unified, so air traffic can also take off in the future.
India would like to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy has promised to speed up the deal.
The aim is to balance because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only ninth among the EU's partners.
The summit paid attention to global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and terrorism, the latter condemned in all its forms on both sides, and called for the convening of a UN conference.
They called for the conclusion of the Doha Trade Round, although both sides played a role in the failure of this.
The EU has confirmed that it remains in the energy and climate programme, i.e. it would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agrees on this, as well as on the fact that a global pact should be signed at the climate conference scheduled for next year and cut greenhouse gas production by 50% by 2050.
They also want to curb the rise in food prices and have supported the convening of an international meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister will travel to the French capital today, where he is preparing to sign a treaty on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, it is hoped that to build the Indian nuclear reactors French companies receive a commission worth 20 billion euros.
According to our news agency, the deal would last 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international event for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair awaits over 7,000 exhibitors from 101 different countries who will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Fair with over 403,000 titles on display and with Turkey as a guest of honor.
It will be the Undersecretary of the Ministry for Cultural Heritage and Activities Francesco Maria Giro to represent the Italian Government in the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Pavilion: Italy will in fact be present institutionally with a Punto Italia - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
The press meeting at the Room Struktur in Hall 5.0 of the Buchmesse will follow: this will be the opportunity to present figures, trends and perspectives on the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of books by foreign authors on the total of Italian production, and in particular on that for adults and children, is gradually decreasing.
Steve Fossett's plane found missing billionaire a year ago
The wreckage of Steve Fossett's plane was found, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert.
The debris was found on a plateau at 3,000 meters above sea level, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammoth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the aircraft, however, there were no human remains.
The Sheriff of Madeira County, John Anderson, escaped the doubts that still remained: "The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that this is exactly what Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared," he said in a news conference.
The sheriff said there were no human remains found either in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was killed in February.
The U.S. Bureau of Transportation Safety (Ntsb) said that a team of investigators was sent a few hours after the sighting of the wreckage, who then identified the device: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, missing since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in the Neva.
Yesterday, also in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett’s personal belongings had been found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with the name of Fossett, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweatshirt.
Fossett's search was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of primates.
In 2002, on his sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete the world tour on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he had traveled the world by plane and without a stopover.
Among its many records, also that of having flown at 15,445 meters high, above the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
An off-the-shelf SUV with an original design and well defined by firm lines, wide surfaces and sharp corners.
This is, in summary, the Glk the last born among the offroad "compact" of the house of the star with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to give a breath of novelty in this sector.
Due to its content outside the traditional canons, the communication that will accompany the launch of the Glk SUV, available at the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from October 17, will be unexpected and unconventional.
Thus, the advertising battle that will accompany the debut of the new car will initiate an unprecedented mode of communication also through a forward-looking 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by an automobile brand.
A project of maxi-posters, divided into three different phases, which will dominate the very central shopping street of Milan, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision and thanks to special glasses distributed near Corso Como it will be possible to see the new SUV in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, by looking at the image you will have the impression that the car exits the poster.
Subsequently, through the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, and then reassembled into a single image.
Undoubtedly Mercedes with this ad is trying to introduce something new in the stereotypical field of automotive communication.
With this formula, will you be able to stimulate the interest of future buyers? We will see.
These are the Italian Hooligans.
From Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are those 150-200 boys and girls that all of Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been following the Blue National for years and that so far, in fact, had never created excessive problems.
He had never met any of his opponents.
The extraction of the group is to the right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
To these in Sofia were added twilight groups (a few units, in fact) from Campania and Puglia.
They have tricoloured flags where the militants’ hometowns appear: Saturday evening they were removed for not being identified.
They are inspired by the English fan base.
In Bulgaria they found a fan of real Nazis, that of Levski.
Figc had made available to the Italian fans 144 tickets for the match: all nominal, therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminale had in fact controlled them all: among those who left for Sofia there was no one with an ongoing Daspo, no one who had been prevented from attending a stadium.
Four blue fans, who had a history of stadium offenses, had been denied the ticket and prevented from leaving.
Now the Viminale is waiting to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police then will take measures: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo for at least five years to fans who have been arrested or who have been identified in the riots.
An international Daspo that prevents you from attending not only Italian stadiums but from all over Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, will no longer set foot in a stadium.
Thankfully.
But now there is the fear-emulation: that is, to those little more than one hundred and fifty, more are added.
"We must put out this fire immediately and not legitimize those who behave in this way," the Viminale said.
So, "eyes open especially in view of the National game on Wednesday in Lecce".
In Puglia, in fact, there is a small core of supporters of Ultras Italia.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, Tuesday the Casms which can also count on a section of the Aise, that is, the secret services, which deals with the problems of the stadium.
"The Duce-Duce choirs and the arm stretched during the Mameli hymn? In Bulgaria it is not a crime...".
This is the thought (expressed in a very unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, from a few weeks director of the Viminale Observatory (he took the place that was first of Francesco Tagliente and then of Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had previously been Quaestor of Trieste where there is a core of supporters of the group Ultras Italia, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to honor the Duke but certainly the behavior of those 150-200 fans was shameful.
"I do not become a sociologist - adds the number 1 of the Observatory - the crimes should be attributed in the country where the fact takes place.
Until now this group had remained in line, now we will see well what happened and we will evaluate for the future.
But let’s also talk about whistles to the Mameli hymn: even those are not a crime, but if you allow me, I am not an education...”.
