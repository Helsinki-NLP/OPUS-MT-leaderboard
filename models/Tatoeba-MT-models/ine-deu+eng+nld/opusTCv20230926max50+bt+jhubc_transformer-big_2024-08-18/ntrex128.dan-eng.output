Wales Politicians Afraid to ‘Like Fools’
There was dismay among some members of the Welsh National Assembly over a proposal to change their title to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was due to plans to change the name of the assembly to Welsh Parliament.
AMs from across the political spectrum are concerned that the name change could lead to ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party said his group was concerned because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means fool, and pwp means shit.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party said that the group as a whole "was not satisfied" and had proposed alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that there is only a short verbal leap from MWP to Muppet (fool).
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced in the same way as the letter u is pronounced in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently composing a legislative proposal to introduce the name changes, said: "The final decision on designations that Members of Parliament will receive is, of course, up to Members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, with broad support for calling the Assembly a Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the title of the AMs, the Commission preferred Welsh Members of Parliament or WMPs, but the MWP option was most supported in a public consultation.
AMs are apparently proposing alternative options, but the struggle to reach an agreement may prove difficult for Assembly Speaker Elin Jones, who is expected to put together a bill on the changes within a few weeks.
The reform bill contains other changes in the way the Assembly works, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and the composition of the committee system.
The AMs get the final vote on what to call when the bill is debated.
Macedonians hold vote on change of country name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether their country's name should be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The vote is being held in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim on Greek territory and has long protested against Macedonia's attempt to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov opposes the vote and says he will ignore the vote.
Supporters of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply a price paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The clocks in St. Martin's are still, while the churches in Harlem are fighting
“The older people I spoke to said that in the old days there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
“Today there are none of those.”
He said it's understandable that the bars are disappearing.
“People socialize in other ways these days,” he said.
“Bars no longer constitute the neighborhood’s living rooms, where people enter on a daily basis.”
In relation to churches, he worries that the money raised on selling assets won’t last long, and that they “before or later are back where they started.”
He adds that churches could be replaced by apartment complexes full of the kind of people who don’t help the neighborhood’s recurrent retreats.
“The overwhelming majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings are white,” he says, “and it further breathes into the development where these churches eventually close completely because it is unlikely that most of the people moving into the condominiums will become members of the churches.”
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin’s a decade later.
The original Methodist church moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had functioned nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under priest John Howard Johnson, who headed a boycott of shops on 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, which would not hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to restore the building, they ordered the bell game.
Priest David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin's, proudly called the bell game "the bells of the poor".
The expert, who played the bell game in June, called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first clock game in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger clock game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's couldn't find a replacement for him.
What has taken place in St. Martin's over the past few months has been a complicated tale of architects and contractors, some of them acquired by church leaders, others by the diocese.
The Council of the Congregation – the leading body of the parish, which consists of leading laymen – wrote to the diocese in July about concerns that the diocese "would try to push the expenses forward" to the Council of the Congregation, even though the Council of the Congregation had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors that the diocese sent in.
Some of the congregation members complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old on California lobster dive
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy Saturday as he dived after lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, officials say.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then along with a group paddled over to him to help him out of the water.
Hammel says that he thought it was just excitement to have caught a lobster, but then he realized that the boy was shouting, "I was bitten!
I was bitten!”
"His entire collarbone was torn up," said Hammel, as he saw the boy.
"I cried out for everyone to come out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is reported in critical condition.
It is not known what species the shark attacked.
Lifeguard Larry Giles said at a media briefing that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to his upper torso.
Officials closed access to the beach on the stretch from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for safety reasons and to conduct investigations.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but that most are not considered to be dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to take over the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with rows of beauty products with special assistants in the style of department stores.
As part of a major effort to take over the UK beauty market, which has a value of <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continues to grow, while fashion and residential products are falling. The larger lines of beauty products are being tested in 11 stores around the country and launched in several stores next year if they prove to be successful.
The investment in beauty products takes place as supermarkets look for new goods for shelves that were previously used for television, microwaves and home products.
Sainsbury’s says they are doubling their range of beauty products to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which are being introduced for the first time.
The existing ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space with branded areas in the style of those seen in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching the range of Boutique makeup, making the majority of products suitable for vegans – something increasingly demanded by younger shoppers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop is testing stalls in two Sainsbury's stores. The first opened in Croydon in southern London last week, and the second opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and a trend towards buying small amounts of food daily from local merchants means that supermarkets need to do more to get people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, has said the stores are going to look like department stores as the supermarket chain takes up the battle with discount chains Aldi and Lidl by introducing more services and non-food goods.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitat outlets since they bought both chains two years ago. These measures have strengthened their grocery sales and have made their purchases more profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempts to update beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 00s, but the collaboration ended with a dispute over how to distribute the profits from the pharmacies in the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy chain to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 three years ago.
According to the strategy, Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding an additional assortment of luxury skin care brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s commercial director, said: “We’ve changed the look and feel of our ranges of beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to advise.
Our range of brands is designed to suit all needs and the immersive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a compelling destination that challenges the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'Rassing' After Holly Willoughby Withdraws from Deal for <0xC2><0xA3>11 Million
Dragons' Den star Peter Jones left "happy" after TV host Holly Willoughby withdraws from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn’t have time for their home product and accessories brand Truly.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
This Morning host, 37, went on Instagram to announce that she is leaving the project.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons’ Den star Peter Jones furious after she pulls out of their lucrative lifestyle brand at the last minute – to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was “rashy” when the popular TV woman during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deals – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5m – meant she no longer had enough time for their home product and accessories brand Truly.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and was tipped to double Willoughby’s estimated fortune of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
Willoughby, 37, went on Instagram to announce that she left Truly while Jones flew out of the UK to one of her vacation homes.
A source said: "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It should have been a long-term project that she had to deal with for the next few decades.
Her decision to resign surprised everyone involved.
No one would believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods at the headquarters in Marlow, which is already ready for sale."
Experts estimate that the announcement from This Morning host, which is among the UK’s highest-earning stars, could cost the company millions of dollars due to large investments in products – ranging from pillows to candles to clothing and home products – and the potential for further delays in launching.
It can also be the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three Willoughby and husband Dan Baldwin have had a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined the board in March.
The couple are on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of the shares in Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S, replacing Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, “We couldn’t comment on his business moves.”
Hard talk, "and then we fell in love"
He laughed at the criticism he would get from the news media for giving a comment that “is not worthy of a president” and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in his parody of a news host.
“I gave up nothing.”
He noted that Kim is interested in a meeting more, after Trump proclaimed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "similar reaction" from the United States to North Korea's initial action against disarmament.
He noted that the United States instead continues with sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure running.
Trump took a more optimistic view in the speech at his voter turnout.
"North Korea is doing very well," he said.
“There was a war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have been killed.
Now we have a wonderful relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had produced positive results – ending missile strikes, helping with the release of hostages and returning earthly remains from U.S. military personnel.
And he defended his unusual approach to Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave stately, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this tightly packed arena, we would have about 200 people standing there,” Trump said, pointing to the group right in front of him.
Indonesian tsunami and earthquake destroys island and kills hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organisations were informed that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lombok's population was homeless, a national state of disaster was not declared, which is a prerequisite for calling for international relief.
“In many cases, unfortunately, it has been clear that they are not requesting international assistance, so it is a bit challenging,” Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign employees can work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Response Service, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Due to the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly exposed to, the country is very poorly prepared for natural disasters.
Tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, but they are not a common sight on other coastlines.
A warning had been issued in Palu, but apparently a tsunami was missing, and it has likely affected the death toll.
Even under the best conditions, it is challenging to travel between the many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that has been in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it is going to take at least three days to reach the new crash site.
President Joko Widodo has made Indonesia’s insufficient infrastructure a central point in his election campaign, and he has spent a lot of money on roads and train tracks.
But Mr Joko's administration has been plagued by a lack of funding in line with next year's election campaign.
Mr Joko is also experiencing pressure from underlying sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands removed from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge equalizes at last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with a score in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri small 30 meters from Chelsea's goal, while his team was behind by 1-0.
He dotted to the ball with his left foot before making a high shot at the furthest pole.
The ball flew high over the field towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball dropped over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was just about getting in the position to get the ball. Players like Shaq always try to get as far forward as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, and I made a single touch. I didn't think much about it and just took the shot."
Chelsea led 1-0 in the semi-finals, after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Chelsea striker delivered with his heel back to Mateo Kovacic before setting the pace on the midfield and sprinting into Liverpool's half of the field.
Kovacic made a quick one-two in the midfield.
He then made a long pass that led Hazard into the field.
Hazard ran from the defence and finished against the furthest pole with a left-footed shot past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will compete against Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 15:00 on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea play against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 15:00 on Thursday in London.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, Indonesia’s disaster preparedness said early Sunday.
Many were reported trapped in the debris from buildings that fell after the earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale. It hit Friday and created up to 6 meters high waves, spokeswoman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old was found with a puncture wound at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street. A 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called on people in the area who saw or heard something to step forward.
Police Assistant Brian O'Hagan said: "We are in the early stages of the investigation, but I would urge anyone who has stayed near John Street in Birkenhead and has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also encourage everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something with the dashcam, to contact us as they may have information that may be critical to the investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman, whose body was found, is from the Birkenhead area and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the site to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and police say they are informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver, who lives in Grayson Mews, has just tried to enter his apartment, but is told by police that no one is allowed to enter the building.
He was paralyzed when he heard what had happened.
Residents are now told that it will take several hours before they can get back in.
A police officer was overheard telling a man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A crying woman arrives.
She keeps repeating, "It's so terrible."
At 2 p.m., there were two police cars inside the dam and another car just outside.
A number of police officers were inside the blockade and were monitoring the apartment complex.
Anyone with information please write a message directly to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and provide log 247 on September 30.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell will be the latest memorial hit by discussion of "rewriting history"
The removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick’s proposals as “crazy” and an “attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the context of the current debate on the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace at Westminster would become a target.
The image storm during the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s stunning depiction of Cromwell is a testament to 19th-century attitudes and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe is worthy of tribute.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case pressure from the monarchy.
Whether it is an accurate depiction is subject to ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is one recognizable figure representing one side of the struggle.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of tribute and remembrance."
Killer Raids and Kills Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only under his surname "Yuan", was found dead with an overgrown artery and smeared in blood near a pig trail at the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to give injections of vaccines to pigs at a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the pig trail next door was open.
He said that in the pig trail there was a big eagle with blood in its mouth.
A forensic study confirmed that the 250-kg pig had bitten the farmer to death, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and injured,” said the cousin, who goes by the surname “Wu,” in a quote from Guiyang Evening News.
Footage from security cameras showed that Yuan entered the market at 4.40am on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked away to prevent it from attacking others while police were collecting evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
This is rare, but there have been previously recorded cases where pigs have attacked humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 295 kg pig, a Welsh farmer, steered against his tractor, until his wife scared the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a “trigger.”
“They’re just medical.
They're napping, they're very curious... they're not out to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are expected to cause heavy rain in much of the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves across the cooler waters off Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will provide heavy rain with flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 38 m/s, a Category 1 hurricane, at 10 a.m. (Danish time) and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low-pressure vent is forming across the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it begins to push tropical moisture northward into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will give up to 254 mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical moisture will interact with the low-pressure runoff coming closer, creating heavy rain in the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Locally, 25 to 101 mm of rain will create dangerous storm surges, liquid precipitation and possibly landslides in the desert.
The tropical humidity will create rain with up to 51 to 76 mm of rain per hour locally, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 51 to 101 mm of rain is expected in parts of the southwestern United States, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There is a high probability of storm surges with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the dispersed nature of the tropical rain.
It would be a very bad idea to move out into the desert on foot when there is a risk of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into rushing rivers and thunderstorms will create strong local winds and create dust blows.<0x3C>/seg>
The approaching low-pressure runoff will provide heavy rain along the coast in parts of southern California.
There is a risk of a total precipitation of more than 13 mm, which can result in smaller amounts of liquid precipitation and smooth roads.
This would be the region’s first rainfall in their rainy season.
Spreading tropical rainforests will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday and spread more late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the area of Four Corners on Tuesday and continues on Wednesday.
In October, there may be large temperature fluctuations throughout the United States as the Arctic gets cooler, but it remains relatively warm in the tropics.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences across the central United States on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 11 degrees between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of the central and eastern United States are expected to experience a warm start in October with temperatures above 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
There could be up to 26 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long climate outlook indicates that there is a high probability of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million saw the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people saw Thursday’s gripping testimony from nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, and the woman who has accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television stations.
At the same time, the political battle with stations that interrupted the regular programs continued to tell of Friday's late developments: an agreement composed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, who allowed the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh, in a drunken state, was grazing on her and trying to take her clothes off for a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in an emotionally charged testimony that he is 100 percent sure it didn’t happen.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that 20.4 million saw it on Friday.
The company recorded average ratings on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no immediately available viewers from other stations that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring how many people view programs in offices.
To put it in perspective, it is a spectator figure that corresponds to a match during the NFL playoffs or the Oscars.
The Fox News Channel, whose opinion-driven hosts have strongly backed the appointment of Kavanaugh, was at the top of all stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the hearing that lasted all day, Nielsen said.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught in front of open CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning as protesters shouted at him as he tried to take an elevator to the hearing in the Judiciary Committee.
He stared downwards for several minutes as he was scolded, and CNN broadcast live.
"I'm right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
He was told, "You have so much power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and said before the elevator closed that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All television stations covered live a few hours later when the Judiciary Committee was to vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination should proceed to a vote for the entire Senate.
But Flake said he would only vote in favor of the conviction that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee the following week, which the Democrats, who are in the lower house, had asked for.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with the Coons and a number of senators thereafter, Flake made his decision.
Flake's election was influential because it was clear that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister accuses critics of playing politics with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the EU in order to "play politics" with Britain's future and undermine national interests. This happened in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview alongside that with Theresa May on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson made his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal for Britain and the EU to collect each other’s tariffs was “completely ridiculous.”
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson Suspected of Killing LSU Player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, is arrested and jailed on suspicion of negligent manslaughter, Baton Rouge police said.
Officials released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost their glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson’s DNA on them, CBS subsidiary WAFB reported.
After Simpson's interrogation, police said he had confessed to the shooting at Wayde.
His bail is set at $350,000, the lawyer reports.
The East Baton Rouge Parish coroner released a preliminary report Friday saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound from head to neck.
The police department says a task force from the Louisiana State Police, the state police laboratory, police from Southern University and citizens in the area have assisted with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports leader Joe Alleva thanked the police in the area for their "care and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198 cm tall forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "broken" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“That’s the kind of thing you’re always afraid of,” Wade said.
Volcano spews ash over Mexico City
Ash, spewed from the Popocatepetl volcano, has reached the southern quarters of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity occurred in the crater, and 183 gas and ash discharges were recorded within 24 hours.
The center monitored the rumors and shakes over several rounds.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on car windows in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed increased activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since an earthquake measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of anniversary of independence vote
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters seeking independence clashed with Urobots as thousands took part in rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarizing vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists held back unrobots, tossed with powder paint, and created dark dust clouds on streets that would normally be full of tourists.
There was also fighting later in the day, when the police used their spells to keep the fighting down.
Over the course of several hours, independence groups shouted "Nothing forgotten, nothing forgiven" and were greeted by unionist demonstrators shouting "Long live Spain".
14 people were treated for minor injuries that occurred during the protests, the local press reported.
The mood remains high in the independence-remembered region a year after the October 1 vote, which was declared illegal from Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly voted for independence, but the voter turnout was low, and those opposed to the separation largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the holding of the vote during violent clashes at polling stations across the region.
Independence groups had camped the night of Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was held, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer dared to hope that Catalonia could achieve independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy because they had the opportunity to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although they won a narrow but important victory in the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum, and many of their best-known leaders have either themselves moved into exile or are in detention and awaiting judgment for their role in holding the vote and the subsequent independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded the protests on her phone in support of police and said the conflict was created by politicians on both sides.
“There are more and more tensions,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been waiting for his trial since last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament elections next year.
"The nomination as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to distance ourselves from the backlash in democratic values and the subjugation we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house hit by car
Three men at 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car repeatedly hit a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19.30 BST.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said damage occurred to the gates and the building itself.
There may also have been an armbrush fired at the car at some point.
Menga shot gives Livingston 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
The forwards Livingston surprised the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard his only second defeat after 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's shot made the difference as Gary Holt's team moved up side by side with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team has not won out in the league this season and will face the leading team Hearts, which they are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Rangers will visit Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, in turn, expands their undefeated streak to six games, and head coach Holt has still not been defeated since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses chances against cash outsourcing
Holt's team should have been ahead for a long time before they scored, and their direct playing style created major problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but delivered across the front of the goal, after which Alan Lithgow inevitably struck out of the goal after he slipped in to hit Craig Halkett's transverse header in front of the goal.
The home team was happy to let the Rangers play in front of them because they knew they could give the outfielders trouble in dead-ball situations.
And it was under the circumstances that the important goal came.
The Rangers made a free kick, and Livingston took advantage of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson created the line-up for Menga, who made a touch and scored from the middle of the field.
At the time, the Rangers had dominated the ball possession, but struggled to get through the home team's defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely unchallenged.
The pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's shot was averted with the feet of Rangers goaltender Allan McGregor, and Lithgow shot out of the frame during another of Livingston's dead ball situations.
There were ongoing deliveries into Livingston's field, but were averted, and two penalty kick demands – after Halkett's tackle on substitute Glenn Middleton and one hand on the ball – were rejected.
"Phenomenal" from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
phenomenal effort and strong result for Livingston.
Everyone played great and exceeded the expectations of their upward journey.
Their playing style and squad have remained largely unchanged since their return to the top league, but much of the credit must go to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since he joined.
There were many heroes.
Leader Halkett was great and led a well-organized defense, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on his toes throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked dog inspiration.
They have been really good under Gerrard at times, but they played below level.
Their finishes lacked sharpness – only once they were deprived of the home team – and this is a sharp awakening for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the scoreboard.
Erdogan gets mixed reception in Cologne
There was a smile and blue sky on Saturday (September 29th) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations with the two NATO members.
Disagreements have arisen over areas such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's rapprochement with the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new, large mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police held a crowd of 25,000 for security reasons from gathering in front of the mosque, but plenty of supporters appeared nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan’s opponents – many of them Kurdish – also made themselves noticed and condemned both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to accept the country.
The competing protests reflect a controversial guest who is seen as a hero by some German Turks and ridiculed as an autocrat by others.
Accident on the road in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist has died in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southwest of the city at around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped, and there were rescuers on the spot, but the man died on the spot.
The accident comes a few months after another cyclist died in a collision with a car whose driver fled the scene, on Childers Street, about 1.6 km from Saturday's accident.
Metropolitan Police said police officers were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Road barriers have been set up, bus routes have been rerouted, and motorists are encouraged to stay out of the area.
Long Lartin Jail: Six Officers Injured During Unrest
Six prison officers have been injured in unrest in a high-security prison, according to the Prison Office.
Unrest erupted in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 9.30am BST on Sunday, and the unrest is still ongoing.
Specialized Tornado officers are brought in to deal with the riots, which involve eight inmates and take place in one wing of the prison.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries on the spot.
A spokesperson for the Prison Service said: “Specially trained prison staff are deployed to deal with the ongoing unrest in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and are clear about those responsible being reported to the police and may end up spending longer time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 detainees, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison inspector was treated at the hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October last year, Urobots were summoned to prison for dealing with serious unrest in which employees were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with storm surge (dry areas may benefit)
It’s rare for a tropical low to hit Arizona, but it’s most likely to happen early next week when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa move across the desert landscape of the southwestern United States and create a risk of storm surge.
The National Weather Service has already issued storm warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday with arrival late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix pointed out in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones had retained the status of tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 km of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 51 to 102 mm of rain with isolated amounts up to 152 mm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest desert landscape, including the central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, are likely to get 25 to 51 mm with the possibility of 102 mm locally.
For those outside the risk of storm surge, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Flooding is a very serious matter, but it is likely that some of the rain will benefit because the southwestern United States is currently experiencing drought.
According to U.S. drought monitoring, just over 40 percent of Arizona experiences the least extreme drought, the second highest category,” reports weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa is expected to hit the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa still has hurricane strength on Sunday morning with a maximum wind force of 38 m/s and is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moving north at 19 km/h.
The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific and therefore falls in strength.
It is therefore expected to hit Mexico with tropical power on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rain over parts of Mexico can become heavy and pose a high risk of flooding.
"Precipitation is expected to total 76 to 152 mm from Baja California to northwest Sonora with the possibility of up to 254 mm," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the border with Arizona early in the morning on Tuesday as a tropical low, which will then move up through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday night.
“The primary expected hazard from Rosa or the remnants of it is very heavy rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert area of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center reported.
The rain is expected to create life-threatening storm surges and liquid precipitation in deserts as well as landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with a puncture wound in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4 a.m. on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital, where his condition is reported to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, police in Avon and Somerset said.
Officers have called on anyone who may have a cell phone recording of the incident to come forward.
Trump Says Kavanaugh Was Under the Democratic Party's 'Wickedness and Anger'
“A vote on Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the reckless and monstrous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has been exposed to the “evil, anger” of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, sharply denying accusations from Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave testimony at the hearing on his charges.
The president said Saturday that the "American people saw the skill, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
“A vote on the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that confirms one of the most skilled legal brains of our time, a lawyer with a fantastic past in public service,” he told a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to the nomination of Kavanaugh, while he talked about the importance of Republicans appearing at the polling stations in the midterm elections.
"In five weeks, one of the most important choices in our lives will be made.
“You can’t vote for me, but you can vote for me,” he said.
"That's why I'm traveling around and fighting for amazing candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission to “fight and block.”
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place by Friday, a person high in the Republican party has told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, death toll rises
At least 384 people were killed, many of them washed away by huge waves hitting the beach when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when up to six meters high waves hit the coast at dusk, sucking many in death and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale.
"When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people were still engaged in activities on the beach. They did not run immediately and became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster preparedness BNPB, said during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it towed cars, tree trunks, houses, it hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved through the open sea at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
More people managed to survive by climbing trees to escape the tsunami, he said.
Some 16,700 were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The disaster preparedness has published aerial photographs showing many destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes could be felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Board of Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released during Friday’s major earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city is geographically located at the end of a long, narrow bay, and it may have made the tsunami bigger, the board said.
Nugroho described the damage as “extensive” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of a number of victims were found pinched under the debris from collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 had been injured and that 29 are reported missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be greater along the 300-kilometre-long coastline north of Palu, the Donggala area closer to the earthquake's epicentre.
The communication "was completely paralyzed without information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"There are over 300,000 people living here," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it could get much worse,” they said.
The board was criticized on Saturday from many fronts for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, but officials said the waves had arrived within the time period when the warning was issued.
In amateur footage shared on social media, one can hear a man on the top floor of a building desperately shouting warnings of tsuamia coming closer to people on the street below.
Within minutes a wall of water hits the coast and carries buildings and cars away.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut off communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending cargo planes with emergency assistance from Jakarta and other cities, authorities report, but there is still a heavy need for food and basic necessities among those evacuated.
The city's airport has been reopened, but only for relief work, and remains closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
It's really bad.
World Vision employees from Donggala have come safely to Palu city, where employees seek shelter under tarpaulins set up in the courtyard at their account. They came past areas with extensive devastation along the way, Doseba said.
"They told me that they destroyed so many houses," he said.
It's really bad.
Even when aid organizations began the hard work of putting the relief work back on, complaints came that foreign emergency workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, financial aid, supplies and staff from abroad may enter only if the area where the accident occurred is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says ‘OK, this is a national disaster,’ we can open up international assistance, but there is no status yet.”
On the second night in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the missing people held on in hopes that their loved ones would become the miracles that illuminate the grim tales of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled up by a sewer.
On Saturday, rescue workers released a woman who had been trapped under debris for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding national team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who were caught at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Monday, were among his pupils.
“As a veteran of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon told how in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel circulated in paragliding circles, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the participants in Palu, who were part of the festival on the beach.
However, his messages resulted in only one gray fly bone instead of two blue ones.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he says.
Thieves take $26,750 while filling up ATM in Newport on the Levee
The thief stole $26,750 Friday morning from a Brink's employee who was meeting a cash machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport police press release.
The driver of the car had emptied the vending machine in the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Detective Assistant Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man ran "up behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money that should have been delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the press release, but police did not say how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about the identity of the thieves, please contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
He announced the shift on Saturday on Twitter, where he wrote: "The creature formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show, who cancelled for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
The name is an abbreviation of his current artist name, but West has previously said that the name has religious significance for him.
"I think 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, discussing his album title with radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – which is a reflection of our good, bad and confused sides, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of a number of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has switched between Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
One of West’s former collaborators, JAY-Z, has also switched between uppercase and lowercase letters and changed whether the hyphen is included.
Mexico’s AMLO vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexico’s newly elected president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches its 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he "never would use the military to repress the Mexican people."
Troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 at a time when left-wing student movements took root in many parts of Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly state grants to students and opening several free, open universities.
He has said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities draw young people into criminal gangs.
U.S. Should Double Artificial Intelligence Funding
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in the field, said investor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government have made announcements about artificial intelligence. However, the United States still lacks a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
However, China introduced their plan last year and aims to take the first place in innovation in artificial intelligence by 2030.
“It would be a good idea to double the research budget for artificial intelligence as all other countries are so far behind the United States and we are looking for the next big breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Doubling the budget could double the chances of the next big achievement in artificial intelligence being achieved in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee published his book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a system of artificial intelligence that beat the highest-ranking American Othello player, and later became the head of Microsoft Research and the director of Google's department in China.
Lee recognized previous technology competitions supported by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge, held by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when a new competition would come so that the next visionaries could be identified.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants, Lee says.
“It’s not China that’s grabbing the academic leaders, it’s the big companies,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have in recent years employed star students from universities to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States strengthen efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think that PhDs in artificial intelligence should have automatically offered work permits.
The Chinese government issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions in a manner similar to the National Science Foundation and other state organizations distributing money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint center for artificial intelligence to involve partners from industry and research, and the White House announced the foundation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF currently invests over $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
However, U.S. legislation seeking to establish a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has stood still for several months.
Macedonians hold vote on change of country name
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia," a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's attempt to gain EU and NATO membership.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and maintains that the name of its northern neighbouring country constitutes a claim to Greek territory and has therefore used its veto when Macedonia has applied for membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's primarily Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not take part in the vote, and a boycott campaign has raised doubts as to whether the number of voters will amount to the 50% required for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ballot was: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that it is a price worth paying for access to associations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged as a result of the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote on the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the EU umbrella, because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
The vote is not legally binding, but enough Members of Parliament have said that they will respect the result of the vote and enforce it.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission said there were no irregularities reported at 1 p.m.
But voter turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, where 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I voted today because of my children. We belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko participated in the vote in Macedonia on a change of the country's name, which would open up for membership of NATO and the EU, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and pulled up seats in front of tents set up by those who want to boycott the vote.
"We are for NATO and the European Union, but we will achieve membership with a raised forehead, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want us like Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership would provide a much-needed investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
“I think a large majority will vote in favour because over 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a “yes” result would be a “safeguard of our future.”
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research indicated that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the vote - less than the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by the Macedonian TV channel Telma TV indicated that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the vote to be valid, the turnout must be at least 50 per cent plus one vote.
If the vote fails, it will be the first major political loss for the pro-Eastern government since it took office in May last year.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero fights through the entire Brighton defence and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling fought the Brighton defence in Manchester City's 2-0 win Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy with his scoring, which came after 65 minutes.
The Argentine striker received a midfield pass at the beginning of the sequence.
He quickly ran past three Brighton defenders before sprinting out onto the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He fought past one defender, and subsequently ran from several on the edge of Brighton's field.
He then made a delivery to the left and found Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right boot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems with his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We were talking about him playing for 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the immediate lead in the Premier League game.
The goal came after 29 minutes.
In that sequence, Aguero received the ball deep within Brighton's territory.
He sent a nice pass along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few touches before leading Sterling towards the furthest pole.
The Sky Blues forward punctured the ball into the net just before it slipped past the goal.
City will compete against Hoffenheim in the group stage of the Champions League at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer Wants to Drill Rockies
Nationals are eliminated from playoff participation, so they didn’t have much to fight for.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to take the pitch on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there is still an opportunity to participate in the playoffs for the Rockies, who have played a game more than the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The Rockies at least held on to a wild-card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but still have their first division title in favor.
“Although we have nothing to play for, we can go to the game knowing that the atmosphere would be at its highest among the audience here in Denver and that opponents would play at the highest level I’m going to face this year.
Why shouldn’t I be excited to play in those circumstances?”
The Nationals have not yet announced the starting line-up for Sunday, but will likely put Scherzer as pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be the first man on the spot for the 34th time, trained his pitches on Tuesday and would pitch on Sunday, which is usually his rest day.
The right-handed player from Washington is at 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds election in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while he spoke about the importance of Republicans appearing at the polling stations in midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
It’s one of the big big ones – you can’t vote for me, but you’re actually voting for me. That’s why I travel around and fight for amazing candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You can see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you can see it’s happening right now.
And they are determined to get power back by all available means. You can see how evil, how disgusting they are.
They don't care who they're hurting, who they're going to drive over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, but we won't give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, have as their mission "struggle against and block".
“And you’ve seen it over the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry and wicked and disgusting and lying.”
He mentioned the Supreme Democratic Senator of the Senate Judiciary Committee Dianne Feinstein by name, which loudly triggered the arc from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, oh no, wait – it was really bad body language – the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Labour is no longer a large party.
They are intolerant of those who express their views.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it wasn’t really a surprise.
I am just the latest in a long line of Labour MEPs who have been told that we are not welcome – just because we have given our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was given a similar treatment because she took a strong stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship act was to criticize me because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
In relation to the importance of a responsible economic policy, in relation to national security, in Europe, ironically similar problems, which Jeremy disagreed with former leaders.
In the invitation to the meeting in Nottingham East Labour on Friday, it was stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local Member of Parliament, the meetings on Friday evening have been just like that.
Today, unfortunately, the tone of many meetings is not like that, and the promise of a "friendlyer, gentler" policy is far in the past, if it ever came into being.
It has become increasingly clear that divergent views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that all opinions are weighed according to whether the party leadership can accept them.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues, with whom I previously thought I shared a political stance, began to expect me to make a U-turn and take positions that I would never otherwise have agreed with – whether it was about national security or the EU's internal market.
When I say my opinion in public – and it really doesn’t matter what I’m saying – there’s a long streak of crude messages on social media that call for de-election and contradiction of the middle-seeking policy and tell me that I shouldn’t be a member of Labour.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments that are directed at me are usually political.
I have deep respect for the professionalism and willingness to fight among colleagues, who are overwhelmed every day with sexism or racism, but still continue to fight.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how normal abuse has become.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour should create a tolerant culture.
But in reality it is no longer a spacious organization and with every vote of no confidence or change of selection rules, the party becomes narrower.
I’ve received a lot of advice over the last two years that if I put a lid on myself and I’m not that high-pitched, then I’m going to “make it.”
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined Labour 32 years ago, when I was in school, I was provoked by the Thatcher government’s neglect, which had left our classroom in a dwindling state, and I set out to create better public services for those who need it most – whether it has been as a city councillor or minister in the government.
I have never hidden my politics, not even during the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way confused about my political positions and disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who tabled the resolution on Friday, I would like to say that when the country is turning against Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of Labour.
But the one message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to the local electorate, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no kind of threat of renunciation or political aptitude will deter me from acting on what I believe is in your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unconquered Ayr becomes top team
Two late scorings may have got the final result to draw a not entirely truthful picture, but there’s no doubt Ayr deserved the victory in this amazingly entertaining match of the day in Tennent’s Premiership.
They are now at the top of the scoreboard and are the only undefeated team of ten.
In the end, it was just as much their superior defense as their better use of chance that carried the home team home, and coach Peter Murchie had absolutely the right to be satisfied.
"Our fights have been demanding so far, and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, “Respect Ayr, they used their chances better than us.”
Grant Anderson's scoring after 14 minutes was followed by a successful kick from Frazier Climo and brought Ayr ahead, but a yellow card to Scottish national team player Rory Hughes, who was awarded for the game by the Warriors, gave Melrose an advantage, and Jason Baggot made a scoring that was not followed up by a kick.
Climo expanded Ayr's lead with a penalty kick just before the half, scoring and then getting a solo score, so that stood 17-5 for Ayr at the break.
But Melrose started well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's scoring, followed by a kick from Baggot, reduced the points gap to five.
After a long break, Ruaridh Knott suffered a serious injury and was carried off the field on a stretcher. When the game was resumed, Ayr advanced with a score from Stafford McDowall and a follow-up kick from Climo.
Acting Ayr leader Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card, and again Melrose exploited their extra man with a score from Bruce Colvine without a follow-up kick after a period of intense pressure.
However, the home team came again, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball, MacPherson could after a line-out score behind the emerging Ayr cluster.
Climo followed up with a kick inside the poles and followed up with a more just after the game was resumed, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent wingman Gregor Henry off for the home field's fifth scoring.
Still Game star looking for new career in the catering industry
Still, the game star Ford Kieran seems to be taking the step into the catering industry after it emerged that he has taken the position of director of an authorized restaurant business.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and is the main character in along with his collaborator Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, but a source suggested to the Scottish Sun that Kiernan would be part of Glasgow's "growing market for restaurants".
"The sea is ours": the inland state of Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
Sailors patrol around the navy headquarters, enveloped in rigs, in La Paz.
On public buildings there is raised a sea blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are overpainted with the motto: "The sea is ours, it is a right.
It’s a duty to take it back.”
Throughout the inland state of Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century is still strong, and so is the longing to sail the Pacific again.
The hopes may be at their highest in decades, while Bolivia awaits a verdict from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of voting.
"Bolivia has momentum, a sense of community and clarity, and of course is waiting with a positive look at the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court of Justice on big screens across the country and hope that the court in The Hague will give Bolivia the consent that, after decades of discussions, Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia sovereignty over an area with access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic native president, who faces a controversial election campaign next year, also has much at stake at the verdict on Monday.
“We are close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
But analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will take Bolivia’s side – and that there would be no major changes if it did.
The United Nations Assembly, which is based in the Netherlands, does not have the power to hand over Chilean territory and has stipulated that it cannot determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The ruling of the International Court of Justice only six months after the final arguments were heard indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of advancing Bolivia's cause, the past four years may have given back.
"The case of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian leadership," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales’ warlike rhetoric has done away with the remaining Chilean benevolence, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the discussions at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was abnormally fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end an era of 139 years of disagreement and gain benefits for both parties," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used the maritime problem as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up the right of access to the Pacific,” he added.
“The judgment is an opportunity to see that we have overcome the past.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless they can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons if they can’t first rely on Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to honour promises made during a summit in Singapore between rival leaders.
His comments were given in the wake of U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo apparently facing a relaunch of the locked nuclear diplomacy three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a "desirable dream" that continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to declare, as long as Pyongyang has not first taken significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a summit more.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about abolishing an arsenal that the country most likely sees as the only thing that can guarantee their security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month in preparation for a new summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest collections with large headgear, which you will soon be able to buy in local stores
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or block the sun completely, find the answer here.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne raised the veil on the catwalk for a collection of strange extra-large headwear as part of their SS19 collection. The collection impressed at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats have dominated Instagram this summer, and the two designers have sent their eye-catching creations down the catwalk.
Valentino’s most impressive work was a sumptuous one with a feather-like broad shadow that covered the heads of the models.
There were also other extra-large accessories, including watermelons with jewels and even a pineapple – but they’re not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had intertwined lips that resembled Hannibal Lecter more than haute couture.
One creation resembled diving gear with snorkel and mask, and the other one resembled a melted waffle ice cream.
And if you continue the big fashion statements, you're in luck.
Stylists predict that the huge hats could come to stores near you.
The giant hats arrive on the heels of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 60 centimeters wide shade that is seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand, which is behind the highly impractical hat that was spread across social media, has sent a new great creation down the catwalk – a beach bag in straw that is almost as big as the model showing it.
The orange bass bag with bast fringes and a white leather handle was the most eye-catching in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see large hats and beach bags in regular stores next summer. The designer has had such an influence that it will be hard to ignore the demand for accessories in huge size."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland’s independent schools have many great academic achievements behind them, and it continues in 2018 with yet another set of outstanding exam results, which are further enhanced by individual and collective success in sports, arts, music and other endeavors in the local environment.
With up to 30,000 students around Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the best level of service to their students and parents.
The independent schools try to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can put together and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we find that modern language remains a popular topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it hits his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it strikes the heart.”
It’s an important reminder that we can’t just stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust among people from other countries.
We can look at the latest exam results this year that language ranks highest in the statistics with the most passed exams in the independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students studying foreign languages received the high grade A.
The data collected by SCIS’ 74 member schools showed that 72 percent of students received grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those studying German, 69 percent of those studying French, and 63 percent of those studying Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important competences that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language is now perceived as subject choice at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools pensa and elsewhere.
A 2014 study by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17% of employers were unable to fill vacancies due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more important in terms of preparing young people for their future careers.
More job opportunities will require language skills in the future, and these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career they choose, if they have learned a different language, they have a great advantage in the future with a lifelong skill like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a head start to competitors.
According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 respondents in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French is the only language spoken by a multi-digit percentage, 15 percent.
Therefore, it is important to invest in language education for those who are children today.
Speaking multiple languages, especially languages from developing countries, gives children a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, schools differ in what languages are taught.
A number of schools focus on the more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are expected to be most important for the UK when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child is interested in, there will always be a number of languages to choose from at independent schools with teachers who are specialists in the field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills required to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
At present, it cannot be denied that language continues to be really important for the future of the country in a global business environment, and it must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should in fact be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and this distinction to Scotland’s youth.
You have to do it right.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron to make Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James is playing in Sunday's pre-season opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It is not yet clear how many minutes he plays.
"It's going to be more than 1 and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is unlikely to play the entire game.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans in relation to the Lakers' planned six games before the start of the season.
“Where I am in my career, I don’t have to fight before the start of the season to get ready,” he said.
Trump's election in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a strip of voter turnout tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s Trump’s first of five scheduled voter meetings next week, including meetings in Trump-friendly locations like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote to confirm Trump’s nominee for the vacant seat of the Supreme Court has been suspended, Trump is trying to create support for the upcoming midterm elections because Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
When is Trump’s election in West Virginia tonight, and how do you see it online?
Trump’s election meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, will be held at midnight (Denmark time) on the night between Saturday, November 29 and Sunday, November 30, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s election in West Virginia online via livestream on YouTube.
Trump will most likely talk about this week’s hearings on Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated for the Supreme Court. The hearings were tense due to allegations of sexually offensive behavior, and the Senate’s expected vote on confirmation has been suspended for a week as the FBI investigates the charges.
But the primary goal of this strip of electorate meetings is to create momentum for the Republicans facing a difficult election in November.
People from President Trump’s campaign team said the five polls next week were aimed at “creating energy among volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Control over Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible now that we are entering the busy campaign time,” a Trump campaign spokesman, who would not be quoted by name, told Reuters.
This evening’s voter rally is being held at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and is expected to attract Trump supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by media from Pittsburgh,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia’s Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to step up to give him a boost in the polls,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA has shown a fighting spirit and tries to keep hope alive ahead of Sunday's singles duels
After three one-sided innings, Saturday's four-man duels were perhaps what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging momentum pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, but a concept that players believe in – not least in competitions like this one.
Where would they say there is momentum now?
"They led by six points, and now it's four, so we probably see that as a bit of momentum," Spieth said before he held the four-pointer.
Europe, of course, has the advantage: they are 4 points ahead and there are 12 more points to play for.
However, as Spieth says, Americans feel like they have some wind in their sails, and there are plenty of encouraging things to focus on, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both can boast three points out of four possible.
Spieth has been sharp from tee to green and sets a good example for his teammates.
The loud cheers grew louder as the round continued, and Spieth hit an important put, which ensured victory in duel four, even though he and Thomas had been two backstrokes after two duels.
His put, which ensured them the fight on hole 15 was met with a similar scream – the kind of scream that shows that he does not believe the American team is out of the competition yet.
“You just have to find the inner strength ahead and focus on your own struggle,” Spieth said.
That’s all the players have left now.
18 holes where you can make a difference.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, arguably the biggest story from the Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange but sympathetic couples have scored four points in four games and appear flawless.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't get a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogey's Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
The series and the way the energy seems to flow both to and from the wild audience, shows that it will be the ones that will be the hardest to beat on Sunday. And it would undoubtedly be very popular if a potential European victory would be fixed by Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
They are always in sync with each hole.
It is too early to speak of a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short trial against Sergio Garcia, the morning in the four-man duels, when he formed a pair with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes dug the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they were never close to getting out of.
Sunday no one can help you out of your hole.
The four-ball and two-team two-player matches are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and the way the strategy can change lightning fast.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has created a significant lead before the last day, but the four-man duels have also shown that Team USA has the fighting spirit that some, especially in the US, have doubted.
Europe creates lead at 10-6 ahead of last day in Ryder Cup
Europe has a big advantage before the last day of the Ryder Cup, after they came out of Saturday’s fourballs and foursomes with a lead over the US at 10-6.
The well-playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way with two victories over a troubled Tiger Woods and have so far scored four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn’s European team, trying to win the cup they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an imprecise American team in the morning fourballs and won the series 3-1.
The United States provided more resistance in foursomes. They won four games, but were still behind.
Jim Furyk's team will need eight points in Sunday's 12 singles matches to keep the cup.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who together have been nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are just the second pair in Ryder Cup history to have won four points in their first four games.
They crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs and then elegantly defeated a discouraged Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who fought through the first two games Saturday, had little ingenious glimpses, but now he has lost 19 out of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose was well-rested for the morning fourballs and returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and won a 2-1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – who is number three in the world.
Europe, however, has it quite as they want it, on a slightly windy day southwest of Paris.
Triple-major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the way for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They got a hard-fought 2-1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and later returned and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in foursomes after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in Ryder Cup history that a team has fought back after being behind with four points before the singles games. However, since Furyks currently has the cup, they only need to score a draw to keep it.
After being second best for two days, however, it seems they can’t master a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says it will not disarm unilaterally if there is no confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister said on Saturday that continued sanctions would heighten their distrust of the United States and that the country would not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly that North Korea had shown "significant benevolence" over the past year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, decommissioning an area for nuclear tests and promising not to further develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We have not seen a similar reaction from the United States," he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security and under such conditions, there is no chance that we ourselves will take the first step and disarm unilaterally.”
While Ri reiterated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” approach to nuclear disarmament, where North Korea would be rewarded if they took gradual steps. But his speech seemed important as it did not unequivocally reject unilateral disarmament, as has otherwise been the case in the past from Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint statement from Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim vowed to work “nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula,” while Trump vowed to guarantee North Korea’s security.
North Korea has called for a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also shown resistance to softening tough international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'nuclear disarmament first' and expands the pressure with sanctions to achieve their purpose by coercion and even opposes the 'declaration of the end of the war'," Ri said.
“The notion that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream come true among people who don’t know who we are.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions reinforce our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader highlighted at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If the nuclear disarmament were to be negotiated with South Korea and not the United States, the negotiations would not be so entrenched."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ris’ speech was very different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that firing North Korea’s missiles at the US mainland was inevitable, after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.
Last year, Trump threatened the UN with “total annihilation” of North Korea, but this year he praised Kim for showing courage in terms of disarmament, but said there is still much to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea collapses.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn’t have a schedule for these actions, but said, “It doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday, "The Security Council must maintain the sanctions with conviction and without error until we achieve the total, final, confirmed nuclear disarmament."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased economic sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to stop Pyongyang's missile and nuclear weapons program.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and subsequently said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times during the year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, while North Korea accused him just hours later of making "passive demands."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to close a missile plant as well as a nuclear complex if the United States took "equal steps."
He said Kim had told him that the “equal steps” he demanded were the security promises Trump made in Singapore, as well as moves toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard take a course on getting enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University has given all undergraduate students more sleep. The purpose of the course is to counteract the growing macho culture, where one studies all night held up by large amounts of caffeine.
One researcher has shown that students at the world’s best university often don’t know the first thing about taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has made the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He got the idea for the course after giving a presentation on the effects of lack of sleep on learning.
“When the presentation was finished, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why do I first get to know this now that I’m on the candidate?’
“She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, offered for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleep habits can improve one’s academic and sporting performance as well as one’s overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health field, says the university has decided to offer the course after finding out that students were in severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The hour-long course consists, among other things, of various interactive exercises.
In one of the exercises, there is a picture of a college room where students have to click on coffee cups, curtains, running shoes and books to gain knowledge about the effects of caffeine and light, and how one’s athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, and how important good sleep habits are.
In another part of the course, participants hear about how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attacks, blood clots, depression, and cancer.
Participants are encouraged to think about their daily habits by clicking on different icons on an interactive map of the campus.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we think they have a right to know – just as you have a right to know how cigarettes affect health,” adds Professor Czeisler.
The pride in taking an allnighter still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and increased pressure on students have led to sleep deprivation being a growing problem.
The “secret weapon” against stress, fatigue and anxiety is good and adequate sleep, he said – it even counteracts weight gain because lack of sleep makes the brain think that one is starving, why they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler organize the course last year when he took one of his courses in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and made him work on making it a general course throughout the university.
He hopes that the next thing will be that all graduates are offered a similar course before continuing their education.
Professor Czeisler recommends students to set an alarm so that they know when to go to bed and when to get up. This can raise awareness of the harmful effects of light from electronic displays, which can move at the circadian rhythm and make it harder to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goal from Menga lowers Gerrard and co.
The Rangers suffered another defeat on the outside, as Dolly Menga's goal meant that Steven Gerrard's incoherent team had to take a 1–0 defeat at Livingston.
The team from Ibrox was out after their first win on the field since the 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrard only the second defeat in 18 games as coach, thus giving eight points up to the Hearts in first place of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga hit seven minutes before the break, which an uninspired Rangers team could not respond to.
The Rangers are now down in sixth place, while Livingston is up in third place after Hibernian with only the goal score difference.
And there could be more bad news on the way to the Rangers, as line judge Calum Spence had to be treated after being hit in the head by a thrown object that appeared to be coming from the outfield section.
Gerrard made eight changes to the lineup that reached the Betfed Cup semifinals by toning past Ayr.
Holt, on the other hand, pitched with the same 11 who shaved a point of the Hearts' lead last week, and he would have been delighted to see his sharp team exhaust the opponents all over the field.
The Rangers had the ball the most, but Livingston was more effective.
They should have scored two minutes into the game when Menga's first-ever leg sent Scott Pittman against Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder's attempt passed.
A deep free kick from Keaghan Jacobs found its way to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defender Alan Lithgow kicked past the rear post.
However, the Rangers took control, but played more on hope than ability in the attacking game.
Alfredo Morales was at least not satisfied when Judge Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's appeals for a penalty kick when he and Steven Lawless bragged together after a quarter of a game.
The Rangers managed only two shots on goal in the first half, but former Rangers goaltender Liam Kelly had no problems with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's tame shot.
Although Livi's opening in the 34th minute was somewhat coincidental, it must be said to be deserved for their efforts alone.
Again, the Rangers could not handle a dead ball situation in depth from the Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who took the time to find Menga who could easily kick it into goal.
During the break, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which almost immediately gave way when the wingman sent the ball in to Morelos, but the well-playing Kelly ran from his position to block.
But Livingston forced the outsiders to play on their premises with many long balls up the court from Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's team could have expanded the lead in the final part of the game, but McGregor rejected Jacobs with a safe hand before Lithgow headed next to the goal.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton appealed again for a late penalty kick after being torn with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson also looked here the other way.
Yearbook: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from the yearbook "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today – if we count... – was the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that would eventually lead to the apparatus known as the geiger counter.
The Geiger Counter has become a staple of both science and popular culture, as seen in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans starred as peasant scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a geyser counter used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that the radioactivity in the minerals makes."
Evans: "Stop it, now it's happening!"
"His" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before he would have turned 63.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach the Immune System to ‘See’ Cancer Cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of treatment
The method consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and changing them in the laboratory
They can then “see” the protein that is common to many cancers and where they are injected again
A test vaccine performs promisingly in patients with a variety of cancers.
When a woman with ovarian cancer was treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, the cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting immune cells from patients and changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein called HER2, which many cancers have, and then inject the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our findings suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “makes several cancers develop,” including breast, ovarian, lung and bowel cancers, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, taking immune cells out of patients and "teaching" them to attack cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a certain type of leukemia.
Kanye West gave a Trump-friendly speech wearing a MAGA hat after his SNL appearance.
It didn't go well.
After an incoherent appearance in the Saturday Night Live studio, Kanye West was bowed when he paid tribute to US President Donald Trump, saying he himself would run for president in 2020.
After playing the evening's third song, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great Again helmet, he began a whistle-blowing speech against the Democrats and maintained his support for Trump.
“I talk so often to white people who say, ‘Why do you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
But if I were worried about racism, I would have long since moved from the United States,” he said.
SNL began the evening’s show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony in the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding Christine Blasey Ford’s assault charge.
Although the footage was not shown, comedian Chris Rock West uploaded the tirads on social media.
It's unclear if Rock tried to expose West by posting the footage.
West also complained to the audience about the poor treatment backstage due to his headgear.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, 'Don't go out there with that hat on.'
They bullied me!
And they said I had sunk deeply,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Would you like to see how deep I've sunk?" and said that he would put on his Superman cape because it means "You can't decide what to do.
Try it with love.”
The audience bowed at least twice of his comments, and the SNL staff appeared to be embarrassingly affected, Variety said with a comment from a person present: "There was a bombing in the studio."
West had been booked as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose then-girlfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many by performing with the song I Love It, while dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group, TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest people: THANK YOU FOR NOT LETTING YOU CALLED BY THE PEOPLE."
Talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just “as he is, and that’s absolutely fine.”
“But I don’t choose to reward a person (by buying his music, his clothes, or supporting his ‘art’) who embraces and pours out an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's allowed.
And we have that too,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced that he had taken a name change to "the entity officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, and thus follows Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rap colleague Snoop Dogg has named Snoop Lion, and the recently deceased music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder after stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed with a knife at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendants are expected to be brought to justice in Belfast on Monday.
The charges are reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington lashes out for toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for swinging swords in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor longs for the stereotypical macho hero, saying that such TV characters often mean that young men feel they have to be tough to be respected.
Kit told Sunday Times Culture that he believes “something has gone wrong” and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie at 31, admitted that the problem lies "very much on his mind".
“At the moment, it’s very much on my mind – where have we gone wrong in the city with masculinity?” he said.
"If we look at the current problems, what have we taught young men in their upbringing?"
Kit believes that television may be partially responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very masculine grades.
He continued, “What is born, and what is done?
What is it that young men learn from television and on the street that makes them feel that they should be men in this way?
I think that’s one of the big questions of our time – how do we change that?
It is obvious that something has gone wrong for the young men.”
During the interview, he also admitted that he will not make sequels to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying he is "finished with battlefields and horses".
Kit stars in a November remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film director and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considers it to have met his wife Rose as the best thing about the entire Game of Thrones experience.
"I met my wife because of this series, so that way it has given me my future family and shaped my life forever," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, whom Kit's character, Jon Snow, falls in love with, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie’s estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, according to health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were registered.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, which is a new trend.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people getting HIV in this way has been reduced to somewhat near zero, Chinese health authorities told a conference in Yunnan province.
In one year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute problem in China’s LGBT community.
In 1997, homosexuality was legalized, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be a widespread phenomenon.
Studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men sooner or later marry women because of the country’s conservative values.
Many cases of infection are due to the lack of use of contraception in these conditions.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised free and equal access to HIV medicine as an attempt to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies staff leaked data on Republican senators and thunders against “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
House of Representatives member Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff had shared personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the claims came from websites and support from the "extreme right."
“Lies, lies, and more terrible lies,” Waters wrote in a Twitter post.
The information allegedly contained home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of whom are from Utah.
The information was posted online on Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak happened after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative support sites such as Gateway Pundit of RedState announced that the IP addresses indicated that the information had been posted by Waters' people, after which they published information about a member of Waters' staff.
“This unfounded accusation is completely untrue and a direct lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, is in no way responsible for this leak of information.
“This unfounded accusation is completely untrue and a direct lie.”
Waters' statement quickly received criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“It’s an angry denial,” Fleischer wrote.
“It suggests she doesn’t have the right temperament to be a congressman.
If you are accused of something you haven’t done, don’t get angry.
You can't be defiant.
The motives of the prosecutor must not be questioned.
You have to keep your senses.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Kavanaugh, who was criticized for being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate aiming to take Waters' place in the midterm elections, also made his point on Twitter.
“Great, if that’s true,” he tweeted.
In Waters' official statement, she said her staff had contacted "the relevant authorities and law enforcement regarding these fraudulent allegations."
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are found," she continued, "and that they will be held legally responsible for their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to everyone and everyone on my staff."
Review of Johnny English hits again – stunning spy comedy with Rowan Atkinson
It has become the norm to look for a Brexit angle in all recent films with a British cast, and it also seems relevant to the latest action comedy in the Johnny English series, which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and reappeared in 2011 with Johnny English - born again.
Will the bold, sarcastic self-satisfaction about how sad it is with us become the country's new export option?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face and big eyes has been given his permission to make roars again. His name signals more than anything that he is a comic invention aimed at places where the cinema visitors do not speak English.
He is of course the dull secret agent who, despite his desire to be a smooth gentleman, has a bit of Clouseau, a knife-point Mr. Bean and proper clapping of him who performed a single tone to the Chariots of Fire song at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
He is also originally based on the worldwide and international slutty pants that left chaos in its wake after Atkinson portrayed him in Barclaycard's television commercials.
There are some good moments in this latest shot at the tribe from JE.
I loved it when Johnny English approached a helicopter wearing a medieval armor, and the propellers sounded against his helmet.
You can see Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy, but the humor feels quite overwhelming and strangely superfluous, especially now that more “serious” movie series like 007 and Mission Impossible also feature compelling comics as an ingredient.
The humor seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and to me, Johnny English’s crazy adventures are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson’s silent film junk in the role of Mr. Bean.
The infinitely current starting point for the film is that the UK is in serious trouble.
An internet hacker has infiltrated England’s top-secret spy network and revealed the identities of all the English agents in the field to the dismay of the agent in charge – an unfortunately very small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last chance for a pompous and combat-ready prime minister who is already suffering a complete meltdown in political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this Teresa May-like character, but there’s not much to work with in the script.
When her security advisers inform her that every single active spy has been exposed, she is forced to lift someone’s pension.
And it's, of course, the crappy Johnny English, who's now a high school inspector, but who secretly teaches how to become a secret agent. There are some funny sequences here when English stands for a kind of School of Rock education in espionage.
English rushes back to an emergency meeting at Whitehall and reunites with his hard-tried former right hand Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough has now married an overenthusiastic but well-meaning submarine captain – a role that Vicki Pepperdine was wasted on.
Thus, the Royal Intelligence’s all-out effort Batman and Robin is back when they meet Olga Kurylenko’s beautiful femme fatale, Ophilia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is stumbling close to letting the charismatic and creepy tech billionaire Jason Volta – played by Jake Lacy – pretend to be able to solve England’s computer problems.
English and Bough start their furiously risky escapades: disguised as servants, they set fire to a prestigious French restaurant; they create chaos as they smuggle themselves aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English creates pure ragnarok as he tries to use virtual reality glasses to get acquainted with Volta's house.
All the cannons are fired off in the film’s final sequence, but no matter how well-meaning and energetic it is, there is a sense of children’s television above it.
Very mediocre.
And as I couldn’t help but think with the other Johnny English films: Can’t the English film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that brings his talent to justice?
Labour refuses to ratchet up plan for four-day working week with unchanged pay for Brits
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour is said to be considering a radical plan so that the British can settle for a four-day working week, but get a paycheck for five.
The party reportedly wants business leaders to use their savings from artificial intelligence (AI) to give employees an extra day off.
That would mean that employees would have a three-day weekend without going down in pay.
Sources say the idea would align with the party's economic goal of pulling the country in a more favorable direction for the workers.
Trades Union Congress supports the idea of a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from a changing economy.
An experienced member of the Larbour Party told The Sunday Times: "A political proposal is expected to be published before the end of the year."
“It is not going to happen in a day, but a four-day working week is a goal that fits the party’s approach to changing the economy to the benefit of the workers and to the party’s overall strategy for industry.”
Labour would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party proposed a four-day working week during the 2017 parliamentary election campaign.
However, the goal is not unanimously supported by the Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not party policy and is not under consideration in the party."
Labour's shadow finance minister John McDonnell spent last week's party meeting writing down his plans for a socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell says he is determined to strip power back from “anonymous directors” and “exploitants” in utilities.
The shadow finance minister’s plans also cast doubt on whether the current shareholders of water supply companies will get their money back, as a Labour-led government could “count” them on the basis of immoral acts.
He also confirmed plans to get workers on company boards and to create inclusive equity funds to distribute 10 percent of private companies’ share value to employees who are eligible to receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 annually.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes if FBI investigation of Kavanaugh can change their voice
The FBI investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week. And it raises the question of whether the FBI’s findings could cause Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview shown on Sunday, 60 Minutes journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could dig up something that could make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open to the idea than his colleague from South Carolina.
“Yes, of course,” Kennedy said.
"When I went into the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened – after the accusations came out – and said, “Did you do it?”
He was steely, determined and unequivocal."
Graham’s voice, on the other hand, seems to be chiseled in stone.
“I have decided with respect to Brett Kavanaugh, and other things would require a very violent accusation,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of those she mentioned could confirm it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don’t see that that should change anything.”
What is Global Citizens Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York hosts the Global Citizens Festival – an annual music festival with a very impressive range of artists and an equally impressive goal; to end the world’s poverty.
For the seventh time, the Global Citizens Festival will host tens of thousands of people on Central Park’s large lawns, where they can look forward to concerts with Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes. At the same time, the festival will raise awareness of the real goal of ending extreme poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival started in 2012 and is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international interest organization that fights to end poverty by increasing the number of active opponents.
To receive a free ticket to the event (if you do not want to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers must perform a number of tasks or "actions". For example, do volunteer work, write to a world leader, make a phone call or other meaningful action that can raise awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been, now that they have 12 years left to reach their goal?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert create real change, or is it just another case of so-called “clickivism” – that is, that people feel that they make a difference by signing a signature collection online or making a Twitter post?
Global Citizen reports that since 2011, they have recorded more than 19 million “actions” from their members aimed at different goals.
They believe that these actions have spurred world leaders to make binding goals and policy actions, equivalent to more than $37 billion, which by 2030 are expected to have affected more than 2.25 billion people.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 goals and actions that had been achieved due to their actions, amounting to over $10 billion that had already been disbursed or collected.
The group estimates that these funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main goals is The Power of Nutrition, which started in England and is a collaboration between investors and actionable individuals. They strive to "help children realize their full potential" and promise $35 million to address nutrition problems in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the English government, donors, governments of other countries and world citizens like you, social injustice with malnutrition can become a footnote in the history books," Tracey Ullman, the ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told the audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that the UK government has now pledged funds to improve nutrition for mothers and children after receiving more than 5,000 calls online. This project, Power of Nutrition, will help five million mothers and children with nutrition advice.
In response to one of the website's frequently asked questions, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?",
Global Citizen wrote: "It's going to be a long and hard fight, and sometimes we'll stumble and make mistakes.
But like the civil rights movement and the anti-apartheid movements, it will succeed because we are stronger together.”
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the performers at this year’s festival in New York. Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman are to host.
U.S. may use its navy to "block" Russian energy exports, says U.S. Home Secretary
“If necessary, Washington can use its navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East,” Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke told the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s interference in Syria – especially where they operate at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext for expanding the sale of their energy.
"I think they're in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, just like they do in Eastern and Southern Europe," he said.
And according to him, there are both methods and resources to prevent it.
“With our fleet, the United States has the ability to ensure that there is free passage on the seaways, and if necessary, we can also block them so that their energy does not come to market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to attendees at a meeting held by the Consumer Energy Alliance – a nonprofit organization that considers itself the “voice of the American energy consumer”.
He compared Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, saying they are basically the same.
“The economic opportunities in relation to Iran and Russia are about exploiting and replacing fuel,” he said, referring to Russia as a “one-trick pony” whose economy relies on fossil fuels.
These statements come after the Trump administration has aimed to increase European exports of liquefied natural gas to replace Russia, which is by far the cheapest choice for European consumers.
To achieve this, Trump administration spokesmen, including Donald Trump himself, have tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has made Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double its current capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is exclusively an economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington’s strong opposition to the project is an expression of unequal competitive conditions and is simply due to economic considerations.
"I think we share the view that energy should not be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose a supplier," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said at a subsequent meeting in Moscow with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in September.
The position of the Americans is met with criticism from Germany, which has confirmed its participation in the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, BDI, has asked the US to interfere outside the EU’s energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with a third party meddling in our energy supplies," BDI leader Dieter Kempf said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "strongly considering" running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren "strongly considering" running for president after the midterm elections, she said on Saturday.
At a town council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and that requires a woman in front,” she said.
“After November 6, I will strongly consider running for president.”
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump during the city council meeting and said that he "leads the country in the wrong direction."
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been vocal in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren wrote, “Of course the FBI will have to investigate the case before the vote.”
However, a poll from Thursday shows that most of Warren’s own backcountry don’t believe she should run in 2020.
According to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58% of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
32% supported the possible candidacy.
The poll showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick with 38% in favour and 48% against a possible nomination.
Other high-profile Democratic candidates discussed in the 2020 presidential election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden says he will announce his final decision in January, the Associated Press reports.
Sarah Palin Names Track Palin's PTSD at a Donald Trump Voter Meeting
The 26-year-old Track Palin was in Iraq for a year after joining the army in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through after he’s come home makes me relate to other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and other injuries that our soldiers are returning home with,” she told the audience at a Trump election meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in space" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they have changed and become harder. They go and think about whether there is respect for what their colleagues on land and in the air and all other members of the military have done for the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, preventing domestic violence from being reported, and possessing a weapon in a drunken state, said Dan Bennet, a spokeswoman for the Wasillas police.
18 states and D.C. support opposition to new asylum law
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal objection to a new U.S. law that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. delivered an independent statement Friday in Washington in support of an asylum seeker who opposes the law, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff’s full name in the Grace vs. Sessions trial, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the federal law, has not been made public.
She says her partner "and his violent sons who are gang members" had abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors, who support Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of U.S. asylum seekers originated, as countries with far-reaching problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum law overturned a decision made by the U.S. Aliens Board in 2014, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
District of Columbia attorney Karl Racine said Friday that the new law "ignores decades of state, federal, and international law."
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be decided on the basis of relevant facts and circumstances, and such an impediment runs counter to that principle," the statement said.
The lawyers also argued in the statement that the law on rejecting immigrants harms the U.S. economy, as they are more likely to become self-employed and "deliver necessary labor."
In June, Justice Minister Jeff Sessions’ immigration judges stripped of the right to provide asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
“Asylum is offered to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a given social group or political point of view,” Sessions said in its proclamation of the law on June 11.
It has never been the intention that asylum should remedy all the problems – or just all the serious problems – that people around the world face every day.
As the death toll doubles, attempts to find survivors in Palu become desperate
For survivors, the situation only got worse.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she comforted her little fever-stricken boy at an evacuation center in the devastated town of Palu.
"Every minute the ambulance comes in with bodies.
We are lacking clean water.”
Residents now returned to their destroyed homes to sort through soaked property and save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, which were also affected by the 7.5 earthquake, could not keep up.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who fractured his back and shoulder, lay outside Palu military hospital, where patients are treated outdoors due to severe aftershocks.
He got tears in his eyes when he told how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I was masted up against a broken wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was going to a wedding in the city.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of Propaganda and Propaganda Ads
A week after a Chinese newspaper brought a four-page ad in an American newspaper that drummed up the benefits of U.S.-Chinese cooperation, the U.S. ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily’s paid entry into the Des Moines Register – Iowa’s best-selling newspaper – after accusing China of meddling in the November 6 congressional election.
U.S. officials told Reuters that Trump’s accusation of Chinese meddling in the U.S. election marks a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now locked in an escalating trade war, where they have repeatedly imposed tariffs on each other’s imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs in the trade war should hit exporters in states like Iowa, which backed Trump’s Republican party, Chinese and American experts say.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China’s former governor for a number of years in Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural food to China, said Beijing has hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a leader in Sunday’s Des Moines Register that China “escalates the use of the unholy methods by running propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“By spreading propaganda, the Chinese government takes advantage of the proud American tradition of free speech and freedom of the press by running a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
"In the kiosks here in Beijing, on the other hand, you will find only a few dissenting voices, and you will not get a true picture of the Chinese people's different attitudes to China's worrying economic direction, as the media is under tight control from the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers failed to publish" his article, although he did not say which.
Republicans alienate women ahead of midterm elections with Kavanaugh case, analysts warn
While many top Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh against allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn they will see a backlash in the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The case has set the tone, and most Republicans have already announced that they would like to see the voting process continue.
"This cannot be done again," Grant Reher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article Saturday.
Reher said he doubts that Republican Senator Jeff Flakes (Arizona)'s request for an 11-hour FBI investigation will temper angry voters.
“Women don’t forget what happened yesterday — they don’t forget it tomorrow or in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted at a Senate rally: “November is coming!” as the Republicans, who control the Judiciary Committee, chose to move forward with Kavanaugh’s nomination despite the testimony of Professor Christine Blasey Ford, Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to reach new heights," independent political commentator Stu Rothenberg told the news outlet.
“People say it’s already reached a high level; that’s right.
But it can reach even higher, especially among female swing voters in the suburbs and younger voters – 18-29-year-olds – who rarely vote, despite not liking the president.”
Even before Ford’s public accusations of the Supreme Court nominee’s sexual assault, analysts had pointed out that it could backfire if Republicans continued with the nomination.
"It's become a worse mess for the Republicans," Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote or the final result, or Kavanaugh being held accountable; it’s also about how the Republicans handled this and how they treated her,” Guy Cecil, president of Priorities USA – a group that supports Democrats in being elected – points out to the news channel.
But Americans seem to have divided views on who to believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, where the latter has a little more on his side.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41% of respondents certainly or probably believed in Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they certainly or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they believed that Kavanaugh either probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
At the request of Flake, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other, writes Deborah Ramirez for The Guardian.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her her genitals for a party when they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the Internet plans to make a new Internet and compete with Google and Facebook
The inventor of the Internet, Tim Berners-Lee, is launching a new company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend’s latest project is called Inrupt and is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners Lee joked that the plan with Inrupt is “world domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology so people can create their own “personal online data collection” or a POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were available in a single browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online data collection is that it is up to the user to decide who can access the specific information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea behind Inrupt, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, is to pool resources, processes and capabilities to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some contracted software developers, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team don’t talk to “Facebook or Google about whether to change it completely so that all their business models suddenly become superfluous.”
“We don’t ask for your permission.”
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupts’ “mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that can ensure the integrity and quality of the new internet being built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the so-called net neutrality debate.
While Inrupt is being launched, Berners-Lee will continue to be the inventor and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about the next period of the internet,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: clerical recipient of the Victoria Cross of World War I
The only priest of the Church of England who won the Victoria Cross by fighting during World War I is celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Wann won the Order on September 29, 1918, during the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a sniper and was never told that he had won the highest English military order.
On Saturday, a memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northhamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, said it was "incredibly symbolic" that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's orderly feat.
According to the London Gazette on 29 September 1918, Lt. Col. Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from machine guns and artillery."
He later ran to the front line and led his people forward with the "greatest manpower" before attacking an artilleryman alone and injuring three cannons.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I knew I could never live up to, but that makes me humble.”
He and his brother James Vann also made a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann stated that he "felt very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the support of all these people underscores the true heroism."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead got Gurli Gris
Imagine staying up all night to see the star-studded Bellator 206 and then being refused to see the main event.
There were 13 games on the program from San Jose, including six games on the main program, and they were shown overnight in England on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to meet, viewers in England were somewhat surprised as the transmission shifted to show Gurli Gris.
Some were unimpressed after they had stayed awake until early morning for this very fight.
A fan on Twitter described the switch to a children's cartoon as "a kind of sick joke."
“According to the legislation, this content was not appropriate at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president, when asked about the broadcast.
"'Grisen Gurli', yes."
Bellator’s CEO, Scott Coker, said they will work to include English viewers in the planning ahead.
“When you think about re-broadcasting, I think we can make it work,” Coker said.
“But it’s six o’clock Sunday morning over there, and we can’t find a solution to that until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on the case.
Believe me, when I was changed, I got a lot of messages, and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
In fact, it was the law.
I can promise you it won't happen next time.
"We're just five games instead of six, as we normally do, we tried to give our fans something extra, and then we went over time.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley had 'minority' over sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he felt less valued than everyone else in his upbringing because of his sexuality, but it motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until he got into the larger classes that “everyone isn’t like me.”
When he was on Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said he was less likely to win the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The regular host of the long-running radio show, Kirsty Young, has been off for a few months due to illness.
Daley was a guest on Laverne's first show and said he felt "less valuable" than anyone else in his upbringing because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said, “To this day, the feelings of feeling remembered and feeling different have been the things that have given me the strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so he didn’t disappoint everyone when they got to know his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze winner has become a high-profile LGBT fighter and used her participation at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for a decriminalization of homosexuality in several countries.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without negative consequences, and he would give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said he was “surprised” when he fell in love with a man – American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference had never been a problem.
He said it’s hard to find someone of the same age who has experienced similar ups and downs when going through so much at such a young age – he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later.
In June, the couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "his whole perspective" had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, it would all be about winning a gold medal,” he said.
"But there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he would die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had received tickets to London 2012 – as he would sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him he wouldn’t be there at the time.
I held his hand when his breathing stopped, and I first realized that he wasn’t immortal when he stopped breathing and was dead,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew that was what I’d dreamed of all my life – to dive in front of a home audience at the Olympics. There was nothing that could beat that feeling,” he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first song selection – Proud of Heather Small – which had meant a lot in the run-up to the Olympics and still gave him goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs will run on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Unsharp Mickelson on the bench for the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson sets a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he has to do something about the form if it is not to become a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who sets a record for the 12th time in the competition, which takes place every 2 years, was put on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk due to Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the center of events for the United States as usual, the five-time big winger had to act cheerleader and practice his game in the hope of correcting the whips.
Even at the height of his career, he had the most direct drive, which is why the 48-year-old is not a perfect match for the course at Le Golf National, where the long rough often punishes misguided shots.
And if the pitch wasn’t a big enough mouthful, Mickelson will face the ever-exact winner of the British Open, Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans who start the 12 singles games start strong, Mickelson’s fight can be decisive.
Furyk did not express surprisingly confidence in his teammate.
“He fully understood his role today, slapped me on the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a great faith in himself.”
He’s in the Hall of Fame and has given so much to these teams before – and also this week.
I didn't think he'd play two games.
I imagined he would play more, but that’s how it went, and that’s how it should be.
He wants to be out there like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson beat Nick Faldo's record for most games played in the Ryder Cup.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never fully matched his individual performance.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven draws, although Furyk said his presence contributes with something indefinable.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's funny, he likes to run to people, and he's good to have in the team room," he explained.
"I also think the younger players had fun playing against him this week, which was fun to watch.
He contributes a lot more than just the game.”
European captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn knows that great leadership can quickly disappear
European captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn knows from experience that a solid lead before the final day of the Ryder Cup singles can quickly become nerve-wracking.
The Dane made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but was just getting picked up before the finish line with a 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 victory.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a nice lead in Valderrama, we had a nice lead in Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama where we just won,” says Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn after seeing the 2018 team win both 5-3 Friday and yesterday for a total lead of 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The story tells me and the rest of the team that it's not over.
It's going to be full of rubbish tomorrow.
Go out and do everything right.
It's not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win the trophy, and that is where our focus is.
I’ve always said that I’m focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we’re also aware of what’s on the other side – the best golfers in the world.”
Satisfied with the performance of his players on a difficult track, Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn added: "I don't take any of this for granted.
Tomorrow is a whole new challenge.
Tomorrow, it’s the individual performance that counts, and it’s something completely different.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you’re out there alone, you’re tested on all parameters as a golfer.
That’s what players need to understand – get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you must leave your partner, because he must also bring out the best in himself."
It looks different to opponent Jim Furyk, who hopes for better individual performance than in the partner game with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself has experienced knockouts on the last day, first on the winning team in Brookline, before he lost when Europe made "The Miracle at Medinah".
“I remember every word,” he said when asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999 had spoken to his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want a good start, as you saw at Brookline, as you saw at Medinah.
Once momentum has found a direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfielders.
We’re putting our teams together in this respect and putting the players on the pitch in the order we feel they’re going to be, and we’re trying to create magic tomorrow.”
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the setback and faces Rory McIlroy in the top game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other Europeans play in the first half of the series.
"I chose this group of players in this order because I think it secures us all the way through," Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn said of his choice of singles players.
Germany's new warship postponed again
The latest frigate of the German Navy should have been ready in 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War. But the Germans have to wait at least another year due to technical problems and an escalating price, write local media.
The deployment of the largest ship in the all-new Baden-Württemberg class of frigates, "Rheinland-Pfalz", has been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to become part of the fleet in 2014, but delivery problems have plagued the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, which the fleet ordered back in 2007, will replace the aging frigates of the Bremen class.
They are known to have a powerful cannon, a wide range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Another important feature of the latest frigates is a minor need for maintenance: it should be possible to keep the frigates away from home ports for up to two years.
But the repeated delays mean that the advanced warships – which will reportedly make Germany appear as an overseas power factor – will already be obsolete when deployed.
The failed F125 frigate created headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had delivered a ship back to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Not much was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware failures" that rendered the warship useless in combat situations.
Software failures were of particular importance, as the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class must be controlled by a crew of 120 sailors – that’s only half of that crew from the older Bremen frigates.
It also turned out that the ship was too heavy, which reduced its performance and limited the fleet's ability for future updates.
The 7,000-ton "Rhineland-Palatinate" is said to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to hardware failures, the cost of the project, which includes training the crew, is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), with an initial price of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are becoming even more important in light of recent warnings that Germany’s naval power is shrinking.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German government's defence committee, admitted earlier this year that the fleet "is running out of ready-to-deploy ships."
The official said the problem has grown over time because the old ships were taken out of service without being replaced.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class were ready to become part of the fleet.
National Trust snails for the secret life of bats
New research from an area in the Scottish Highlands tries to reveal how bats use the landscape when hunting.
The hope is that the findings will shed light on the unique behavior of flying mammals and will help in the work of future conservation efforts.
The study is conducted by scientists from the Scottish National Trust and follows common bats, dwarf bats, long-eared bats and water bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed in carefully selected places in the area to record the activities of bats throughout the season.
Data is also collected by NTS staff and volunteers using handheld detectors.
In-depth analysis of the sound recordings will reveal the frequencies of bats and show which species does what.
To produce a detailed landscape picture of their behavior, a report and a map of the habitat is made.
NTS conservation adviser Rob Dewar hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important and how they are used by the different species.
This knowledge can help determine the benefits of habitat conservation efforts such as the establishment of meadows and how best to conserve forest areas for bats and similar species.
The number of bats in Scotland and the UK has declined drastically over the past 100 years.
They are threatened by buildings and urban expansion projects that affect the shipowners and restrict their habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a danger, as can fly traps, chemical treatment of building materials and pet attacks.
Bats are not blind.
But because they primarily hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use an advanced echolocation technique to find insects and fly around obstacles.
The NTS, which is responsible for the preservation of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who often collect data, inspect nests and sometimes do rescue operations.
The organisation has even made Scotland’s first and only dedicated bat reserve in the area around Threeave in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight out of ten of Scotland’s bat species.
The area's guardian, David Thompson, says it's an ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threave we have a really good area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and all the good habitat.
There’s a lot you don’t know about bats, so working here and elsewhere can help you understand what they need to thrive.”
He stresses the importance of looking for bats before doing maintenance tasks on properties, as the destruction of a single nest can kill up to 400 females and young, thereby risking the extinction of an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, disturb or disturb them or their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish project manager for the Bat Conservation Trust, has called on the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of the species we have, we don't know how populations evolve."
Ronaldo Rejects Rape Charges, Lawyers Sue German Journal
Cristiano Ronaldo has called rape charges against him "fake news" and says people "will promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news outlet Der Spiegel, which brought the charges.
The attacker from Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is alleged that he paid her $375,000 to keep it a secret, Der Spiegel wrote Friday.
Hours after the allegations were made public, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers on Instagram Live and criticized the information for being “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news,” the five-time winner of the Ballon d’Or told the camera.
“They will promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They'll be famous for saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything is good,” the player added smilingly.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the charges, which they have called “an unforgivable disclosure of suspicions about the privacy sphere.”
Attorney Christian Schertz says the player would seek compensation for "moral corruption in a class similar to the charge, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident reportedly took place in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to the report filed in Clark County, Nevada, city court.
Mayorga claims that Ronald fell on his knees after the alleged incident and said that he was "a good guy 99% of the time" seized by "the one percent".
The papers claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that there was consent to it.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and got her injuries photographed in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an out-of-court deal because she felt "banged for revenge" and worried about being "publicly shamed".
The 34-year-old now says she will rescind the deal, as she is still deeply affected by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo faced a shift from Manchester United to Real Madrid when the incident was supposed to take place, and this summer switched to Italian club Juventus for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: Britain 'will forever regret' losing car manufacturers
Britain “will regret it forever” if it loses its status as the world’s leading automaker after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "concerned" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily reduce production at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said longer waiting time at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
“As I see it, production will stop at our factory if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March,” said Marvin Cooke, Burnaston’s CEO.
Other British automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, express fears of leaving the EU without a cross-border trade deal.
For example, BMW says it will close its mini-factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concern of car manufacturers has to do with supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal withdrawal.
Toyota’s production runs on a tight schedule, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be problems at the border, which according to the car industry can lead to delays and a lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than one day of production at the Derbyshire plant, and then production would be stopped, the company said.
Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future negotiations with the EU is "composed to precisely avoid these border checks."
“We want the best deal that not only allows us – as I call it – to enjoy our current success, but to seize this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
“The statements from Toyota and other manufacturers indicate that we need to be able to continue what has been successful supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but in the longer term higher prices would reduce the factory’s competitiveness, which would ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a joint trustee at the factory, says that his members are becoming more and more concerned: "My experience tells me that as soon as these jobs disappear, they won't come back."
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could “be postponed another week” as the roster around Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein looks over the shoulder of special prosecutor Robert Mueller during his investigation of Russian election interference, links between Trump’s aides and Russia, and the president’s possible obstruction of justice.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy justice minister and thereby risk Mueller’s independence has been a gossip in Washington for months.
The New York Times wrote earlier this month that Rosenstein was considering wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of ousting the president via the 25th paragraph.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and rumors went that he would quit.
Instead, a meeting was scheduled Thursday with Trump, who was at the time at the UN headquarters in New York.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a coincidence with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who have accused him of sexual assault, were to testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which delayed the Senate election.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders was on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked at the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "No date has been set. It could be this week. I can also imagine that a week could be pushed with everything going on in the Supreme Court.
But we have to see, and I like to keep the press up to date."
Some journalists would challenge the claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of press meetings was not due to TV journalists playing games for the gallery, but added, "I don't disagree that they're playing up to the camera."
She then said that the direct contact between Trump and the press will be increased.
“The president accepts more questions from the press than any president before him,” she said, adding without citing a source: “We’ve looked at the numbers.”
Press meetings will still take place, Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask direct questions to the president of the United States, it’s infinitely better than talking to me.
We’re trying to make it happen, and you’ve seen us do it over the last few weeks, and it’s going to be in the place of the press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump often accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open hearings or press meetings with senior guests.
Press conferences with Trump alone are rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why, when he made an improvised and sometimes mysterious figure in front of the present journalists.
Minister of Health contacts EU staff in Scottish health care after Brexit concerns
The health minister has written to the EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS to express the country’s gratitude and desire that they remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than half a year before Britain withdrew from the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to paying for applications for permanent residence for EU citizens working in its delegated public sector.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal are continuing and decisions are expected in the fall.
But the UK government has also stepped up its preparations for a possible no-deal Brexit.
I know this must be a very uncertain time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the effort each and every employee has made, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from and outside the EU come with valuable experiences and competencies that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare to the benefit of patients and the local community.
Scotland is definitely your home and we would love for you to stay.
Christion Abercrombie Receives Emergency Surgery After Head Injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie was operated on after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ reports.
Tennessee State First Coach Rod Reed told reporters that the incident took place before the break.
“He went out to the sideline and just fell around out there,” Reed said.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before putting him on a stretcher and taking him into further examination.
A Tennessee State spokesman told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie's operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center was over.
Harris added that there are “no details of the type or extent of the damage yet,” and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when he sustained the damage.
Abercrombie is studying in her second year and is starting her first season in Tennessee State after a shift from Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, giving him 18 tackles combined this season.
Foreign buyers are charged a higher stamp duty when buying a house in the UK
Foreign buyers are charged a higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK. The extra money, according to the conservative party, should help the homeless.
This move is intended to dampen Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters.
The higher stamp duty will affect those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to provide <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to the homeless.
Theresa May will today propose that foreign buyers be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy properties in the UK, for the benefit of the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to counter Jeremy Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters with promises of cheaper housing and pursuing those with the highest incomes.
The increase in the stamp duty will affect people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK. The earnings from this will be used for the government’s fight to ensure that everyone has a place to sleep.
The surcharge, which is added above the current stamp duty and the higher levels introduced two years ago on multi-family and rental purchases, can reach 3%.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to collect <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new buildings in London are purchased by people living abroad, which causes prices to rise and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot inside the housing market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost towns" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new bill comes weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a cut in stamp duty to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
He accused major construction companies of keeping property prices up by buying land they don’t use. He asked May to drop the quotas on cheap housing to solve Britain’s “shameful housing situation.”
Corbyn has proposed an eye-catching series of housing reforms, including controlling rental prices and depriving the landlord of the ability to put people on the street if they comply with the lease.
He will also strengthen the possibility of building public housing.
“Last year I said I would use my presidency to restore the British dream; that life will be better for every generation.
And that means repairing our non-functioning housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it may not be as easy for foreign companies and people living outside the UK to buy homes as it is for hardworking Britons.
For too many, the dream of owning a home has become too distant, and the unworthiness of sleeping on the street is still too widespread.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to become Scotland's coach"
The head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says his "ultimate goal" is at some point to become Scotland's coach.
The 42-year-old enjoys the challenge of reviving the club from North East, now third in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back into the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
“I played a game with the B team, and that was it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportssound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland at Hampden with my father when I was a kid, and it has always drawn me.
But that opportunity would only arise if I were successful in coaching clubs.”
Ross's predecessors as coach for Sunderland are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach for Alloa Athletic says he had no concerns about following such established names in such a large club and had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now I'm measuring success by whether I can get this club back in the Premier League.
From the structure and facilities of this club, it undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task, but I’m sure I’ll only see myself as successful here if I can get the club back there.”
Ross is only three years into his career as a coach after a period as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month failure as part of the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa get back after moving down in third-best row and transformed St Mirren from declining threat to title winners the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real way of separating," he recalls of the time in Alloa.
“I honestly thought the coaching act was the right thing for me, more right than being a player.
It sounds strange because I did well, served well and had some success experiences.
But it can be hard to play.
There are a lot of things you have to go through on a weekly basis.
There’s still that kind of stress and pressure as a coach, but it just feels right.
I've always wanted to train, and now I do. I haven't been more comfortable with myself in my adult life."
You can listen to the full interview on Sportsound on Sunday 30 September on Radio Scotland between 12.00 and 13.00 BST.
The best time for a beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The heatwave this summer has increased revenue for England’s pubs, but has put restaurant chains under greater pressure.
Sales of pubs and bars rose by 2.7% in July, while sales in restaurants have fallen by 4.8%, figures show.
Peter Martin, a CGA business consultant who has collected the figures, said: “Continuing sunshine and England’s unexpectedly long World Cup has meant that July follows the June pattern, with pubs seeing an increase of 2.8%, except that restaurants are hit harder now.
The drop of 1.8% in restaurants in June was only worse in July.
Pubs and bars with a focus on the sale of beverages fared best and experienced progress corresponding to the decline of the restaurants.
Pubs with a focus on food joints in the sun, but not as much as the restaurants.
It seems that people just want something to drink.
Across pub and bar chains, sales of beverages increased by 6.6% per month, while food fell by 3.3%."
Paul Newman, who analyses the service industry, said: “The results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
When it comes to sales on the out-of-home market, weather and major social or sporting events are the biggest factors.
It is no surprise that restaurants are still struggling, even though a drop in sales of 4.8% year on year would hurt really much more than rising costs.
The long, hot summer could not come at a worse time for the food industry, and only time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August will provide a much-needed breathing space."
The total increase in sales for pubs and restaurants including new openings was 2.7% in July, reflecting the decline in newly launched brands.

One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
One in five children – up to the age of 11 – have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, a study shows.
A study of 20,000 schoolchildren in grades 4-9 reveals growth in “fake Insta” pages.
The news has heightened fears of sexual content being posted.
20% of students said they have a “main account” that they can show their parents
Every fifth child up to the age of 11 creates social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students from 4th grade onwards reveals tremendous growth in “fake Insta” accounts – a reference to the image-sharing service Instagram.
The news has heightened fears of sexual content being posted.
20% of students said they have a “main account” that they can show to their parents while they also have private ones.
A mother who fell over her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account saw a teenager who urged others to “rape me.”
The survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) for private schools, found that 40% of 11-18-year-olds had two profiles, half of which admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: “It’s frightening that so many teenagers are tempted to create online profiles where their parents and teachers can’t find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the board of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish Athletics at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most successful athlete, and President Ian Bettie described the shift as a great opportunity for those who make sporting decisions to benefit from her vast 10 years of experience internationally.
"Eilidh enjoys great reputation in the athletic world in Scotland, the UK and the rest of the world, and we are confident that the athletics in Scotland will benefit from having her on the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I will try to be the voice of the athletes, and I hope I can contribute and help set a direction for sport in Scotland."
The American, who won two of his four Olympic gold medals in the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, and who is now often a BBC commentator, was unable to go after a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "A month ago I was struck by a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that time would tell if I would get on top of it and to what extent.
It has been hard work, but I am completely healthy, have learned to walk again and do agility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!”
Breast pump advertising that compares mothers with cows gets mixed reception online
A breast pump company has shared opinions online with an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers to cows that are milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be “the world’s first silent breast pump,” the tech consumer magazine has released a sarcastic music video-inspired ad to show the freedom the new pump gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a chestnut filled with hay, to a song in which it reads: "Yes, I milk myself, but you see no tail" and "If you hadn't noticed, this is not yawning, it's my breasts."
“Pump it out, pump it out, I feed my child, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my belly.”
But the advertisement, which has been published on the company’s Facebook page, has caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mixed reception from viewers. Many say that it makes fun of the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"Very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to conceive and give birth before they can produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them shortly after birth.

Another wrote: "Understandably traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another added: "What an insensitive advertisement."
Others defended the ad. One woman admitted that she thought the song was "incredibly funny."
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I would have had one.
Breastfeeding made me feel just like a cow.
The advertising is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It’s a brilliant product,” one wrote.
Another commented: "It's a funny advertisement aimed at mothers who pump milk (often at their workplace or toilets) and feel like 'cows'.
It’s not an advertisement that praises or criticizes the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they have danced with the discreet pumps in their bras.
The concept behind the advertisement is based on the fact that many women who breastfeed say that they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump is completely silent, has no tubes or hoses and fits discreetly in a nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move, keep their children and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and CEO of Mother, wrote: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between breastfeeding mothers and dairy cows, we would focus on the challenges of breast pumping, while showing in an entertaining and recognizable way the freedom that the new pump can provide.”
It's not the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
In London Fashion Week, a mother went to two catwalks for Marta Jakubowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children secretly moved to tent camp on Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has exploded, although the number of border crossings has not changed, partly due to tougher rhetoric and the Trump administration’s tougher laws that make it harder to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they have feared for their ability to stay in the country by standing up and welcoming a child.
The risk of return increased in June when authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of the household would provide fingerprints, and that this data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that they had arrested several people seeking to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The administration later confirmed that 70% of the detainees had pure criminal records.
“Nearly 80% of those who are either sponsors or members of sponsors’ households are staying illegally in the country, and a large proportion of them are foreign criminals.
So we're still chasing those people," Albence said.
In an attempt to deal with children's cases faster, the authorities have introduced new rules that require some of them to meet in court within a month of their detention. Previously, it was within 60 days, say aid workers.
Many people use video calls instead of showing up and talking to an immigration judge about their legal stay.
Those who are found to be ineligible to stay are expedited deportation.
The longer children stay in custody, the more likely they are to experience anxiety or depression that can lead to violent outcomes or attempted escape, according to aid workers and in reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
People advocating for better relationships say these risks are more pronounced in larger facilities like Tornillo, where size makes it harder to keep track of whether a child is suffering.
They added that moving to a tent village without mental preparation or the opportunity to say goodbye to friends can accumulate trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria announces US, French and Turkish “occupation forces” to withdraw immediately
When Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem spoke to the UN General Assembly, he asked Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said the foreign forces' stay in the country is illegal and under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and they will "be met with equivalent means."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war on terror is “almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have fled their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight this crucial war until we have cleared all Syrian areas” for both terrorist groups and “illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily training and advising Kurdish and Syrian-Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the war-torn country.
In the refugee area, Moualem said conditions were good enough for them to return home, after which he accused "some Western countries" of "spreading unfounded fear" that caused the refugees to disappear.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help facilitate these repatriations,” he said.
"They politicize what should be a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that aid will not be made available to rebuild the country until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Syria to create a buffer zone in the last major rebel-controlled city of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
Due to the agreement between Russia and Turkey, a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live, was avoided.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would follow jihadists from the Nusra Front, a pro-Al Qaeda group that "will be wiped out."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committee soon to outline a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for an election. The committee consists of government and opposition members.
Moualem has set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing the legislation of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Trump wins another presidential term
From that logic, Trump is likely to be re-elected in 2020, unless the impeachment trial and scandals end his presidency ahead of time, which many liberal viewers hope.
In what will undoubtedly be "The most dramatic end to a presidential term ever!"
Currently, there is no sign of spectator fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in the best broadcast time has almost doubled for CNN to 1.05 million and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in best broadcast time compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show has the most viewers with up to 3.5 million on nights of big news.
“It’s a spectacle that people are drawn to because it’s not something we understand,” said Neal Baer, who heads the ABC drama Designated Survivor about a leader of the cabinet who becomes president after an attack destroys the congressional building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author behind "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Scovell said.
The chaos has entertainment value.
But unlike all other TV shows, the stories that come from Washington can decide between Roe and Wade whether refugee families can be reunited and the health of the world economy.
Changing the channel is only for the most privileged.
And yet it’s about more than being an enlightened citizen when you watch a six-hour panel discussion where experts discuss Bob Woodward’s use of “deep background” as he wrote his book “Fear”; Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich leather jacket (“covered with hybris,” The Washington Post wrote) and the implications of Stormy Daniels’s life description of Trump.
I will never see Super Mario the same way.
“One of the things that makes it feel like a reality show is that he gives you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” about the Trump show’s rotating crew and daily surprises (challenges with N.F.L, praise to Kim Jong-un.)
But if you miss a paragraph, you're done.
When I got Fleiss this week, it was 26 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was sitting inside and watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He could not force himself away; not with Brett Kavanaugh, who was to be heard on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was to be decided.
“I remember when we did all these crazy shows before, and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Large sums find their way to the close midterm elections to the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th District of Pennsylvania receives large sums of money. As a result of a settlement of two "Congressional Districts", two members of Congress are fighting for the same seat.
This newly relocated suburb of Pittsburgh is causing problems for Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another special election last spring.
Lamb is pitting against another sitting congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania’s 12th district, which overlaps heavily with the new 17th.
The cards were remade after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January ruled that the old district was illegally set up in Republican favor.
The fight for the new 17th district has started a fight for economic funds between the major party committees, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a high-sensitivity election in March's special election for Pennsylvania's 18th district.
The seat has been in the hands of Republicans for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators give Democrats a small advantage.
The U.S. considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but changed its mind
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing with few protests from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners threw out Trump’s management team.
Foreign ministry officials decided to call back senior US diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after "the recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But it was only El Salvador that was punished. They received approximately $140 million from the United States in 2017 for drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions on entry permits, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
As the internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a summit on security and economic development, which was supposed to have continued last year's meeting, which was considered to be a step towards preventing immigrants from coming to the United States.
But in mid-September, top officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place anyway, thus dropping the considerations of penalties for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is due to address the conference, scheduled for mid-October, to send a signal about the importance that the Americans place on the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further harsh demands or penalties from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the case, which were described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who would like to discuss the internal considerations if they remained anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outside analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke out on a condition of anonymity.
Know the history
The next obstacle could very well be the special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible impediment to the investigation, for which there is considerable and publicly available evidence.
Mueller will also focus his investigation on the question of whether Trump’s campaign secretly cooperated with Russia on the attack on the election.
If Congress comes to new hands, Trump is likely to be held accountable as he prepares to meet with voters again and, eventually, a jury of his peers.
There are many uncertainties, and I am not claiming that Trump’s end is inevitable – and so are his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we must all make choices that will affect how long the fight will continue.
In 1938, German officers were ready to launch a coup d'état against Hitler if only the West had been able to resist him by supporting the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and did not seize the opportunity to avoid the years-long bloodbath afterwards.
It is around such turning points that the axis of history turns, and the irreversible march of democracy increases or decreases.
In the United States, there are several of these turning points.
What do we do if Trump fires the man who decides the future of Mueller’s investigation, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein?
Rosenstein’s seat has been warm since the present newspaper could announce that he had proposed last year to make covert recordings of the president and challenged his suitability for office.
According to Rosenstein, The Times’s statement is inaccurate.
“How do we react if the FBI’s recently requested investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is terminated or not properly conducted – or if he is approved in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And, more importantly, will we vote in the midterm elections for a congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these trials, it will be a long winter for democracy.
But because of what I learned in Prague, I believe we can do it.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the homeland of my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America, and sent me 60 years later to light the sabbatical lights on the table with the chin cross.

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic ahead of the match against SK Rapid Wien
The Rangers will take on SK Rapid Wien on Thursday. After the impressive tie in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, they will have good opportunities to advance from Group G of the Europa League with a victory against the Austrians.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his season debut before the 2–2 game against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use the result as a springboard for something even bigger.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
"We went to the match with the belief that we could bring something home and we got a point.
Maybe we could have gone home, but overall it was a fair result.
They were probably the best in the first half, but we came out in the second half and were the best team.
Thursday will be another great European night.
We hope to get three points, but it will be difficult because they got a good result in the last game. But with the audience behind us I am sure that we can put pressure on them and get a good result.
"The last year has been tough because of everything that has happened with my injuries and the changes in the club, but the mood is good now.
The team is good, and the boys really enjoy it.
Hopefully we can drive on now, put the last season behind us and be successful.”
Anxiety over retirement savings makes women sleepless
Despite the fact that the study participants had a firm idea of how they wanted to be cared for, only a few spoke to their family about it.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide survey said they discussed the costs of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about it.
“Most people would like a family member to take care of them, but they don’t do anything to start the conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of National Wide Life Insurance.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t tell them about your wishes in time.
Use your counselor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care. These choices can be decisive factors for the cost.
Ask your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for your expenses.
Long-term care can be financed using a traditional long-term care insurance, life insurance with cash payment or self-insurance with your own funds – as long as you have finances for it.
Get the legal documents arranged: Take the legal fights into the flow.
Get a proxy prepared so you can get a trusted person to handle your medical treatment and make sure doctors and nurses comply with your wishes, in case you can’t communicate yourself.
Consider also an economic power of attorney.
In this case, you appoint a trusted person who can make financial decisions and make sure that your bills are paid if you do not have the opportunity to do so yourself.
Do not forget the little details: Imagine that one of your aging parents urgently needs medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Get all these details down in writing so you're ready.
“It’s not just a question of the economy – who are the doctors?” Martin asked.
"Which medicine?
Who takes care of the dog?
Get the plan in place."
Man shot several times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle on his way home from a tour of the city.
The victim was in his 40s and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, diaphragm and hand.
Officers describe the shooting, which took place around 2:30 a.m., as "completely random."
The victim did not see the perpetrator.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are urging witnesses to stand up.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a violent earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, expecting the death toll to rise.
As the communication routes are out of play, emergency workers have been unable to receive information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicentre of the 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the earthquake struck.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province and is located at the bottom of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, which in 2017 had an estimated population of 379,800.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is a regency that stretches over more than 300 km of coastline on the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The Regency, which is an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the cornerstones of the Central Sulawesi economy, especially in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but takes place mainly in Morowali, which is the coast opposite Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian disaster center, Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, Donggala was again hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is seismologically located on the so-called Pacific bonfire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years have been:
2004: A severe earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami on 26 December that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, including over half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake measuring 6.8 struck south of Java, Indonesia’s most densely populated island, triggering a tsunami that braced against the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 struck near the city of Padang, the capital of western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake measuring 7.5 struck one of the Mentawai Islands from Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake hit the Aceh regency, spreading devastation and panic as the population was reminded of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 were killed by the collapsing buildings.
2018: Powerful earthquakes hit Indonesia’s tourist island of Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son charged with domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for violence.
Palin, a 29-year-old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of reporting domestic violence and for opposing arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to report the alleged crime.
Palin is being held in custody at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with a $500 security deposit unsecured, KTUU reports.
He was brought to trial on Saturday, where he declared himself "clearly not guilty," the network reports.
Palin is charged with three Class A offences, which could result in a prison sentence of up to a year and a fine of $250,000.
He has also been charged with a Class B offense that could result in a one-day jail sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently pending at Alaska’s Veteran’s Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, preventing the reporting of a domestic violent crime, and possession of weapons in an affected state in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups for explaining her son’s violent behavior with PTSD as a result of his posting in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake measured 7.5 and triggered a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes.
The area is without electricity and roads, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just south of central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On social media there are videos circulating that show the moment when the earthquake hits.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu when the tsunami broke out against the coast.
Public Prosecutors Try to Convict Terrorist Suspect in NYC Sentenced to Rare Death Penalty
Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people – a rare sentence that was most recently sentenced to a crime in the state in 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov allegedly used a rental car from the Home Depot construction market to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where pedestrians and cyclists who got in the way were stabbed.
As a basis for the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious personal injury. This is required by the Declaration of Intent for the Death Penalty in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, the death penalty is a possible result of both of these charges.
Several weeks after the attack, a state jury was able to present Saipov with a 22-point indictment, including eight counts of gang-related murder, typically used by public prosecutors in organised crime cases, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “extensive planning and preparation,” the accusers said, describing Saipov’s execution as “horrific, vicious and depraved.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal injury, bodily harm and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," reads the statement.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since New York's Southern District last raised the defendant in a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier, and were sentenced to death in New York in 1953.
The Rosenberg couple were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov was from Uzbekistan and, according to legal documents, showed no signs of regret in the days and months after the attack.
According to police, he told investigators that he was fine with his actions.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to 22 counts of the indictment.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s public defenders, announced that they were “of course disappointed” with the prosecutors’ decision.
“We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty and not accept a confession and life sentence without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma for all those involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defenders had earlier asked the accusers not to go after the death penalty.
Conservative minister says NIGEL FARAGE should take over Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" during a demonstration at the Conservative meeting today.
The former UKIP leader said politicians could “feel the pressure” from Eurosceptics – after one of Theresa May’s own ministers said Farage should take over negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told the Birmingham demonstration that Britain would have “been out now” if Farage had been a Brexit negotiator.
May’s challenge to creating unity in the deeply divided party is underscored by the fact that conservative remnants are participating in a separate anti-Brexit demonstration in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep his compromise plan on track under attack from both the Brexiteers, the Remainers and the EU.
Her allies insist that despite the backlash, she will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels – forcing the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package or “chaos.”
For the Leave Means Leave demonstration in Solihull, Bone announced that he would scrap the Chequers plan.
He explained that Farage should have been included and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had the responsibility, we would have been out now," he said.
The Wellingborough minister added, “I want to fight for Brexit, but we have to scrap Chequers.”
On the background of his EU resistance, he said: "We did not fight world wars to be anyone's subordinate.
We will determine our own laws in our own country.”
Bone denied that public opinion should have changed since the 2016 vote: "That the British people should have changed their mind and want to stay in the EU is completely wrong."
Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Chequers plan is unpopular among the general population, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and among our activists, who are actually on the street and get us elected.
Drop now, Chequers, and start listening.'
As a tip to May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage told the rally that politicians should be able to “feel the pressure” if they fail the decision from the 2016 vote.
“Now it’s a question of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They want to betray Brexit, but we’re here to tell them that we’re not going to let them get away with it.”
In a message to the enthusiastic public, he added: “You need to make sure that the political class that is on the verge of betraying Brexit can feel the pressure.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army here in the country that gave us the victory in Brexit, and we will not stop until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud Britain.”
In the meantime, they marched through Birmingham before a two-hour parade in the city centre.
Spread activists waved Conservative Against Brexit banners after the group’s split this weekend.
Before the meeting, Labour colleague Lord Adonis laughed at the security issues with the Conservative party app.
“It’s the people who claim to have control over Canada’s IT systems and technology, to border controls, to free trade without borders in Ireland,” he said.
"It's all laughable.
There is nothing called a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren 'strongly considering' running for president
Member of the House of Representatives Senator Elizabeth Warren "strongly considering running for president" after the midterm elections in November.
According to the Boston Globe, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at a city council meeting on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, who has often criticized Donald Trump, is set to seek re-election in November against the state’s Republican candidate Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
It has been speculated that she would challenge Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters at the town hall since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren responded that it is time that “women go to Washington and repair our political system, and that requires a woman in front.”
Arrest in LSU's Sims Shooting Robbery Case
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said Friday they arrested a suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, the LSU basketball player.
Baton Rouge police announced that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson had been arrested Friday for an ET news meeting at 11 a.m.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday to ask for help identifying a man on the footage.
20-year-old Sims were shot and killed near Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died of injuries," police chief Murphy J. Paul told 247sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to having been present, possessing a weapon and shooting the Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without problems and is now in police custody in the East Baton Rouge district.
Sims was a two-meter-high third-year student who grew up in Baton Rouge. Last season he played 32 games, started in ten and played an average of 17.4 minutes and made 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is close to the World Cup, after team orders gives him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team’s orders would play a crucial role in the race.
From the leading position Bottas got a good start and was close to hanging Hamilton off completely as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel ran in the pit as the first, leaving Hamilton to fight with the traffic at the back of the field, which should have been crucial.
The Mercedes went into the pit a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back in front when the Ferrari driver reluctantly had to leave the inner court after some wheel contact after a double defence on the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and was number seven after the first innings on his 21st birthday.
He then led for a large part of the race, as he failed to change tires in an effort to take Kimi Raikkonen’s fourth place.
He had to pit in the 44th round, but could not increase the pace of the last eight rounds, which is why Raikkonen secured the fourth place.
“It’s a tough day because Valtteri did great all weekend and really was a gentleman when he let me come by.
The team did an incredible job to secure us both first and second place,” Hamilton said.
Really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a voter turnout on Saturday because she insisted she had not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At an election meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the testimony Ford had given before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead said that the events in the Senate showed that people were “wicked and disgusting and dishonest.”
"The one thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate when you see the anger when you see people who are angry and mean and disgusting and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at statements and leaks, and then they say, 'oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, was it you who leaked it?
Remember her answer... Was it you who leaked the document – “Uh, uh, what?
No, no, no, no.
I haven’t leaked anything.”
Hey, wait a minute.
If we have leaked... no, we have not leaked anything,” he added in an imitation of the senator.
Feinstein received the letter about Ford’s allegations against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
“I have not hidden Dr. Ford’s allegations, and I have not leaked her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
"She asked me to keep the letter confidential, and I did."
But her denial was not well received by the president, who said during Saturday's election: "I tell you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
During the president’s continued defense of the nominee judge to the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexually assaulting three women, Trump suggested that Democrats use the accusations to benefit their own cause.
“They do not waste any money in their efforts to regain power.
You can see the wickedness, the abominations, they don’t care who they have to drum up to get power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars did well again after Friday's Elite League game lost to the Belfast Giants by winning the return game 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants quickly came forward with two goals against Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized at home before Dwyer again brought the Giants to the front.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee, before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two more goals.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's team, who came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Friday's game in Belfast.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the sides, where the Giants went out as victors in the previous three games.
Dwyer dropped out in the fourth minute at 3:35 from an assist from Kendall McFaull with David Rutherford as assistant, when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a busy lead period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt was behind Cownie's equaliser at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants came ahead at the first pause when he made his second goal at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard settled again with a nice goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game late in the second period, and he secured the victory with the team's fifth goal halfway through the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their five games, are at home in Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controllers killed to ensure hundreds of air passengers avoided earthquakes
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after his death to ensure that a plane with several hundred passengers landed safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing, after a major earthquake on Friday hit the island of Sulawesi and triggered a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to devastate the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung’s colleagues fled for life, he refused to leave his seat in the swaying control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained in place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which held on the runway, came safely into the air.
He jumped out of the control tower because he thought it was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said his decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
We got a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“We are broken,” he added.
Authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands, and the country's disaster preparedness announces that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death toll is expected to rise because there are still many bodies in the ruins, and it is not possible to reach them," said spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six meters high waves have destroyed Palu, which is holding a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are flying emergency aid and supplies in.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: “Every minute comes a new ambulance with more bodies.
There is a lack of clean water.
All the shops have been looted.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors, but we don’t know what we’re coming to.
It’s already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask all of you to work around the clock to carry out all tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombrok earlier this year that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now says man missing after lagoon plane crash
The airline behind the plane that crashed into the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia is now saying one man is missing, even though it had previously been reported that all 47 passengers and crew members had been evacuated from the sinking plane.
According to a press release, Air Niugini said it could not locate a male passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to find the man.
The airline has not returned requests for more information about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water during landing at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said Friday that seven people had been rushed to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital until Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
It is still not clear what caused the crash and the exact order of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both say the plane landed in the lagoon in front of the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was flying past the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed on very low water.
"It was really lucky," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other passengers could walk in water to life to get to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the crew panicked and screamed, and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy stated that sailors working to renovate a nearby quay also helped in the rescue work by using a rubber boat to carry people ashore before the plane sank at about 30 meters depth.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in accidents with PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but that Air Niugini has not been involved in these accidents.
Analyst sets timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor’s office ended its evidence on Saturday in the appeal of a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert in data analytics.
He described to the jury how he used teleinformation to compile the course of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several different mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which was contrary to his earlier claims.
When the data showed that his cell phone was close to Chambers' cell phone at the time he had alleged he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police visited Sanford.
Sanford sat down at the witness stand on Saturday and told me he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "lied because my truck was in Nashville."
Another disagreement was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The mobile data showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its procedure on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to vote later that day.
The High Breed: What is Political Hip Hop?
A hip-hop trio would like to challenge the negative view of the genre by giving their music positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol believes that hip hop has moved away from its origins with political messages and social issues.
They want to return to the starting point and and make political hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently had a revival in the UK due to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York babysitter sues couple after firing with 'racist' text
A nanny in New York City sues a couple for discriminatory firing after receiving a text message from a mother who complained that she was "another black person".
The couple denied that they were racist, but compared the lawsuit to "blackmail".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, who is the mother of two, expressed her horror at finding out that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she showed up on her first working day in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
But instead of sending it to her husband, she came to send it to Giselle Maurice, even twice.
When she discovered her mistake, the "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Giselle Maurice and said that their former nanny, as from African-American, had been bad for her job, and that she instead expected a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her one-day work and sent home in an Uber.
Now, Giselle Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for the firing, as well as compensation for $350 a day in the six months she was supposed to have lived with the family, even though this had been agreed without a contract.
"I want to show them that you can't afford to do that," she told the paper on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have defended themselves that they are not racists and that the dismissal of Maurice was justified because they feared that they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
"My wife had come to send her something she wouldn't have said.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told The Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone you had been rude to, even if it had happened by mistake?
Your baby? Your baby?
To be honest."
Plasco compared the lawsuit to "blackmail" and that his wife had given birth two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation".
“Do you really go after someone like that?
It is not very kindly done," the investment advisor added.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the court has already dismissed the couple on social media and shamed their behavior and logic.
New letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that readers could not relate to a talking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was admitted for publication, said of the letter: "It's hard to imagine being the one who reads it for the first time before it was published.
It’s pretty fun to read now that you know how popular Paddington has become.”
She said her father, who worked as a cameraman at the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about a little t-shirt, would have been optimistic even though his story was rejected, and that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "bitterly sweet" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as "a very important part of our family" and says that her father in all modesty was proud of his success.
"He was a quiet man, and he didn't like to brag," she said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it almost felt like you had a child who achieved something: you’re proud of them, even though it’s not really your merit.
I think he kind of saw Paddington's popularity that way.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he used to say that it was Paddington’s fault.”
Saying Goodbye to Dying Daughter on the Phone
After landing, her daughter was taken to the Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad and that she probably did not survive," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad that she would die within the next few minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
So I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my darling.
I'll see you soon.
I'll see you later.
The medicine she had been given to keep her heart running slowly lost its effect.
She was dead a short time ago, and now her body was shut down.
I just had to sit there and wait for it to happen.
I could not cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to try to get together.”
Finally, the mourning Ednan-Laperouse boarded the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
"I bowed my head, and the tears kept running.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane I had an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Sad Women Trying to Stop Suicide Shoppers
Two women who have lost relatives to suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up maps on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers where you can get help.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he suffered from depression, and 18 when he committed suicide.
“I don’t want any parent to experience the grief I’m going through every day,” she said.
45-year-old Sharon Davis said her son was a promising cook with an infected smile.
“His smile was familiar to everyone.
People said his smile brightened the room."
However, he stopped working before he died because he felt really bad.
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old brother found him when he took his life.
Sharon Davis said, “I’m always afraid it’s spreading.”
Sharon Davis made the cards to “tell people that there is someone out there that you can contact and talk to, even your friends.
Don’t go with your thoughts yourself – you have to talk to someone.”
Sharon Davis' longtime friend, Kelly Humphreys, lost her boyfriend for 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
“He didn’t say anything about being sad or depressed or anything,” she said.
A few days before Christmas, he began to change.
When the children opened their gifts, he had no eye contact with them at all."
She said that his death was very traumatic for them, but that they have to get through it: "It has created a hole in our family.
It has torn us apart.
But we all have to go on and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future remains uncertain as FBI investigates
“I thought that if we could actually get something like what he asked for – a time-limited study with a limited scope – maybe we could get some agreement,” Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee “falling from the hind” amid the locked party-split situation.
Why would Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not have the FBI do their investigation?
Their reluctance is due to timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away on November 6, and if the Republicans, as expected, fail, they will be weakened in their efforts to get the man they would like to have elected to the country’s highest judicial office.
George W. Bush has called senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and through that met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI completes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unknown whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would give Vice President Mike Pence the decisive vote and elect him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors 'fall' under Kim Jong-un
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug referred to data from South Korea’s merging ministry and said there were 1,127 runaways last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park mentioned that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher numbers due to human smugglers were contributing to the changed numbers.
Pyongyang has not made any official comments.
The vast majority of North Koreans will eventually be offered citizenship in South Korea.
The South Korean government says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing via China, which has the longest border offensive to North Korea, and which is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone between North and South Korea.
China considers the defectors as illegal immigrants and not as refugees, so they are often forcibly housed.
The relationship between North and South Korea – which is technically still at war – has improved significantly over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the stranded nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This comes after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work towards a nuclear-free Korea on a global scale.
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress.
“Without trust in the United States, there is no belief in our national security, and under such circumstances it is excluded that we will disarm on our own,” Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's unsuitable for the Supreme Court
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh, who has been nominated to the Supreme Court, "hysterical" and said his temperament was not suitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi’s comment came in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help thinking that if a woman had behaved that way, she would have been called hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally dismissed the accusations that he had committed a sexual assault against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and when he talked about his family and his high school years, he almost screamed and was crying.
He also denounced the Democrats in the committee and called the accusations against him "grotesque and a coordinated temperament" arranged by the left, which was angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the presidency in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's statement proved that he could not sit in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was biased toward the Democrats.
“I think he has disqualified himself with the statements and the way he went after the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi left when asked if she would try to bring Kavanaugh to a kingdom court if he was confirmed and if the Democrats got a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I would say that if he doesn’t speak truth to Congress or the FBI, he’s not fit to sit in the Supreme Court, but certainly rather in the court he’s sitting in now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the Washington D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions in connection with Obama’s health reform or the Roe v. Wade abortion case because he is considered a conservative judge.
During the hearings, Kavanaugh did not answer questions about whether he would reverse certain previous Supreme Court decisions.
“It must not happen that a hysterical, biased person should contest a job as a judge and expect us to say ‘I’m sorry, it’s not just great,’” Pelosi said.
And women have to use it.
It’s a fair outcome, months and years of anger that comes over, and she can’t get it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's abnormal, do you?"
She continued, "I got great support from a woman who was boss who said that she also cried when she got angry, but that she developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the one she was talking to, 'You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then she just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as an expression of anger, in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is from one of my first jobs in an office with an overweight of men, where I often cried out of anger, where I was taken by the neck of an older woman – a cold boss that I had always been a little afraid of – and pulled out on the stairs.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They’ll think you’re sorry, and they’ll accept that they got hit on you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of the Colorado Democratic Congress, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was revealed to be having an affair on a boat called Monkey Business and resigned as a candidate, Schroeder was really frustrated and came to the conclusion that she could as well run for president herself.
"It wasn't a very thoughtful decision," she said laughing at me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the run-up, and they certainly didn't need another candidate.
Some called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because it was late in the election campaign, she was lagging behind in fundraising, so she promised not to participate unless she raised $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she thought.
When she gave a talk that she wouldn’t stand up, she was overwhelmed by emotions – gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to raise money and reach out to voters instead of voters, and anger at sexism – that she got a lump in her throat.
“You might think I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls how the press reacted to her.
"You would think I was sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember thinking, what are you going to write on my gravestone?
"She was crying"?
How the U.S.-China Trade War Could Benefit Beijing
The opening salvos in the U.S.-China trade war were loud, and while the battle is far from over, splits between countries could be a benefit for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by imposing tariffs on key Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation this week, with new tariffs affecting $200 billion worth of goods, applies in principle to half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has done so every time, most recently by imposing tariffs of 5-10% on U.S. goods for $60 billion.
China has vowed to follow the U.S. all the way, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to give in after just a moment.
If it causes Washington to withdraw its demands, it means that they give in, but for Chinese President Xi Jinping it will be too embarrassing to bow to the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, US pressure in the trade war can have a positive effect on China in the long run by making the two markets less dependent on each other.
“A quick decision in either Washington or Beijing can create the breeding ground for an economy that can get out of control in both countries, and it’s actually much more dangerous than you thought,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher with a focus on Asia at the think tank Center for New American Security.
Syria 'ready' to accept refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for refugees to return, and asks for help to rebuild the country, which has been devastated by the more than seven-year-long war.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
“Today, the situation is more stable and secure thanks to the successful fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government has continued to control the areas destroyed by terrorists and is working to restore a normal state.
All circumstances are now present for refugees to return to the country they had to leave because of terrorists and the unilateral economic sanctions that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since 2011, when the war began.
Another six million people still in the country need emergency assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would like to receive help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that the government would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that helped support the insurgency.
Europe secures Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team has won the Ryder Cup 2018 and defeated the US team 16.5 - 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won a single Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the trophy back when Captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn's team reached the 14.5 points required to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had a hard time in most of the tournament, shot his drive into the lake on par 3 on the 16th hole, causing him to lose the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian Molinari did well in all rounds and became 1 out of 4 players in total who have won 5-0-0 since 1979, when the current format of the tournament started.
American Jordan Spieth was sent out with 5&4 by the lowest ranked European player, Danish Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen.
No. 1 in the world rankings, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups in his luggage, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the tournament’s most winning European with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t do it.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm really glad to get the trophy back.
It's a team effort and I'm glad I could help," said an emotionally charged Garcia after the European victory.
He sends the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who caught American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a singles match on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods. I followed him as a child," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup history of 13-21-3.
It’s a spooky statistic for one of the best golfers ever to have won 14 major titles, only surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had trouble finding form all weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had a solid game throughout the tournament.
The American captain, Jim Furyk, said after his team's disappointing performance: "I'm proud of the boys, because they fought for the cause.
There was still time this morning when we played back Europe.
We lost.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All his 12 players played really well.
We will regroup, and I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and then we will move on.
I love those 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to lighten your hat.
We were defeated.”
Algae bloom update: Concentrations decrease in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows that there is a general declining algae concentration in parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, there are reports of widespread flowering in the area around Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier – suggesting that the concentration is declining.
The bloom of algae spreads over a 210 km coastline from northern Pinellas County to southern Lee County.
There are less blooms about 16 km from the coast in Hillsborough County, but there are fewer than last week.
Flowering has also been observed in Pasco County.
Medium concentrations have been reported in or at sea in Pinellas County during the last week, low to high concentrations in the sea off in Hillsborough County, background concentration to high concentrations in Manatee County, background concentration to high concentrations in or in the sea off the coast of Sarasota County, background concentration to medium concentrations in the county of Charlotte County.
Respiratory problems continue to be reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There have been no reports of breathing problems in northwest Florida in the past week.
