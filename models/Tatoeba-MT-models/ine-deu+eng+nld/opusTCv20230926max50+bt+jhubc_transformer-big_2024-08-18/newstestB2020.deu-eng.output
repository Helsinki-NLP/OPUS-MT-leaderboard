Fire extinguished in French chemical plant
The large fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen has been extinguished. The prefecture of Normandy announced on Friday. The fire broke out on Thursday night. No one was injured in the incident. The fire department was in operation with about 200 firefighters.
The fire could be stopped.
Anrainers were called upon not to leave their homes. Buildings within 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday. In the chemical plant on the banks of the Seine, additives for lubricants are manufactured. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol of US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the strict regulations of the EU.
Around 400 people work in the plant. The chemical plant has already made headlines in the past - for example, when in 2013 the gas methane thiol escaped through a leak and the surrounding area smelled of lazy eggs. In 2015 about 2,000 liters of mineral oil flowed into the city's wastewater system after an accident.
Woman quits her job to look for her missing dog for 57 days
For two months, a woman from Washington searched for her missing dog - and extra quit her job for it. The seven-year-old Border Collie had run away from the hotel room during a short vacation in Montana. 57 days was missing from the bitch every trace - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I got sick," Carole King told the Daily Inter Lake. She and her husband had left bitch Katie in the hotel room while they were going to dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie had disappeared. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Donner had panicked the dog
In the hope that Katie might still be staying somewhere in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says, "She left about four, four and a half hours ago," Carole King recalls to "Daily Inter Lake." When the automatic front door opened, Katie immediately called out to the dog.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings were looking for their beloved dog. But from days to weeks. "I have never given up. I have never lost hope," Carole King told the Daily Inter Lake, who quit her job as a postman to continue her search for Katie.
"The tears flowed"
57 days after Katie's disappearance, Carole King got a call: A man called in and said that Katie was in his yard. But when King arrived there, Katie had already disappeared again. She searched the neighborhood and suddenly stood her bitch under a tree. "I just hugged her Lake. I had to let her go."
Losses in the Bundeswehr: machine guns disappear without a trace
Friday, September 27, 2019
Six MG3 machine guns are still missing.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition, including three machine guns. The remainder is unclear in most cases. The opposition speaks of a "frightening" extent.
Weapons and ammunition are constantly disappearing in the Bundeswehr - many of them hitherto without a trace. Since the beginning of 2014, the army has recorded the loss of 39 weapons, 39 weapons parts and almost 20,000 rounds of ammunition. This is evident from a list of the Federal Ministry of Defence classified as a covert matter, which the editorial network has edited.
According to the paper from the office of Defense Secretary Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, a part of a weapon and 3474 rounds of ammunition have reappeared so far. Among the weapons still missing are six machine guns of the type MG3, eleven guns of the type M8, and two guns of the type G3.
The extent of weapons and munitions losses in the Bundeswehr has been found to be "frightening", said the left-wing parliamentarian Martina Renner. This was all the more true, since in the course of investigations hardly anything was found again. The left-wing politician spoke of a "poor balance" among the Bundeswehr.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves Iranian port
More than two months after its capture by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of the city of Bandar Abbas on Friday. As ship observation data from Refinitiv showed, the tanker set in motion and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was given to the Arabs as the destination port.
The tanker had actually been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but it initially remained in Iranian waters. The shipping company said it wanted to wait for an official announcement from Tehran.
On July 19, the "Stena Impero" was charged by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the Strait of Hormuz with violating security regulations, but it was suspected that Iran was responding to the controversial, temporary detention of an Iranian oil tanker in front of the British-owned Gibraltar.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the global oil exports are shipped through the strait of the sea. Tensions in the region had intensified immensely in recent months. The trade shipping was intertwined in the conflict between the US and Iran.
Merkel pays tribute to the courage of the people in the Peaceful Revolution
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has appreciated the commitment of the people in the GDR who took to the streets 30 years ago during the Peaceful Revolution. In the autumn of 1989, courageous citizens had put the then GDR regime into disrepute, Merkel said at a festive event of the Thuringian CDU-Fraktion.
Musk to set extradition record
Tesla's quarter may hold record, but despite the delivery boom, there have been losses in the electric car group.
New York.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
Demand is strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, Musk said in a circular, and the challenge is to quickly bring the cars to customers, and Tesla must offer as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla’s shares went out of trading with a gain of more than six percent. The price has not increased so strongly in almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered well 95000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers must be produced in the current and next quarter. Above all, the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there was a loss last
Mysteries solved: That's why we can't tickle ourselves
A kind of brake in the big brain prevents people from tickling themselves. Scientists at Humboldt University in Berlin found this out with the help of experiments on rats, as they announced on Thursday night. In addition, progress has been made on the question of why children resist tickling so fiercely, only to resist more.
Finally, it has also been shown why the mere approach of a tickling hand triggers laughter even before the touch, which lies on a deep layer in the cerebrum, which already triggers the laughter while waiting for the tickling.
According to the data, previous research showed that rats react with "laughing" in the ultrasound area when tickled by humans. This "laughing" is mediated by the part of the cerebral cortex that serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughter is suppressed during self-touch
So far, it has been assumed that the brain can distinguish between self-touching and touching A, but in other cases, science can distinguish between hiccups - that is why people cannot tickle themselves. The Berlin researchers now found out in the experiments on the rats that laughing as well as the activity of the affected area of the cerebral cortex became tickling during a self-touch.
However, if the self-touch and the touch of others pass at the same time, the laughter will also be suppressed. This indicates that the brain of the rat cannot distinguish between the self-touch and the touch of others. The new findings suggested that people can not tickle themselves in an active self-touch.
The rats were also trained to tickle themselves. Thus, in the experiment, they sometimes interrupted this initiation prematurely, showed escape behavior or fearlessness. This ambivalence is similar to the behavior of the children. The ambivalence of tickling is a behavioral reaction that is the same in rats and people.
Disaster averted: Great fire extinguished in French chemical plant
The large fire at a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen has been extinguished, the prefecture of Normandy told AFP on Friday. The fire broke out on Thursday night.
According to the authorities, no hazardous substances have been released. The samples taken do not give any cause for concern, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. No one was injured in the incident. The fire department was in use with about 200 fire fighting vehicles.
Schools and kindergartens closed
Residents were asked not to leave their homes, buildings within 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday.
Factory belongs to the company Lubrizol of U.S. billionaire Warren Buffett
The chemical plant on the banks of the Seine produces additives for lubricants. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol of US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso Directive of the EU, which prescribes particularly strict safety requirements. The plant employs about 400 people.
The chemical plant has already made headlines in the past - for example, when in 2013 the gas methane thiol escaped through a leak and the surrounding area smelled of rotten eggs. In 2015, about 2000 liters of mineral oil flowed into the city's wastewater system after an operating accident.
Brexit: Johnson criticised by his own sister
The prime minister's sister commented on Boris Johnson's speech at the first session of parliament following the lifting of the forced break on Wednesday night. The prime minister threatens to lead the country out of the EU on October 31 without an agreement, should Brussels not respond to his demands for changes to the Brexit deal, but how he wants to achieve this is unclear.
Speaking about Cox, who had campaigned for Britain’s stay in the European Union, the prime minister said: “The best way to honor the memory of Jo Cox and reunite this country would be to carry out the EU exit.” Cox had been assassinated by a right-wing extremist during the referendum election campaign in 2016.
Memorial to Oslo and Utoya bombings unveiled
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 dead, a memorial in honor of the victims is unveiled in Norway on Saturday. The monument "Iron Rose" (German: the Iron Roses) consists of about 1,000 iron rose replicas. They remind us of the roses that had been placed before the Oslo in the days and weeks of thousands of people.
The project of artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud will now be unveiled in the same place - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and relatives of the victims.
The right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik had initially ignited a car bomb in the Oslo government district on 22 July 2011 and subsequently shot dead dozens of participants of a holiday camp of the Social Democratic Workers' Party's youth organization on the island of Utoya.
Iran releases British tanker
The UN General Debate did not bring a solution to the Iran conflict. But now there is a problem less. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" detained in Iran could get back into the sea. It could be a puzzle piece in the peace plan of the Iranian President Rouhani.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero", which has been detained in the Strait of Hormus in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters. After being released by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, the shipping company Stena Bulk said.
The "Stena Impero" has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now sailing to Dubai for medical examinations, among other things, said Reedereif Erik H<0xC3><0xA5>nell. By noon the ship had left the Iranian waters. "It's good that it's over," he told the Swedish television station SVT.
"This is part of a pattern of attempts to undermine the freedom of the seas, and we are working with our international partners to uphold shipping and international law," the ministry said in a statement on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had arrested the tanker on July 19 on charges of disregarding the rules of the law of the sea in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September. The remaining 16 crew members were fine according to the circumstances, said H<0xC3><0xA5>nell. They would have been quick to deal with the situation.
The British government suspected a reaction to a similar incident in Britain's Gibraltar following the establishment of the "Stena Impero": At the beginning of July, a supertanker with oil from Iran, which was supposed to have been destined for Syria, was put on the chain. The delivery, according to the authorities, violated EU sanctions against the US-led country of war.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened consequences. In mid-August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Suspicions that it was a trade deal to get rid of the "Stena Impero" vehemently rejected London.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the world's oil exports are shipped through the strait of the sea. Tensions in the region had intensified immensely in recent months. The trade shipping was intertwined in the conflict between the US and Iran.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear dispute between the two countries. The Americans are accusing the Iranian leadership of wanting to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. The US had stepped out of the international nuclear agreement in 2018 alone, which would prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb and at the same time put its leadership on the political and economic agenda.
Due to the dispute over the "Stena Impero" and other incidents involving tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, the United States is working on a coalition for the military protection of merchant ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani had presented to the UN General Assembly in New York a plan for security and peace in the Strait of Hormuz. With the initiative "Coalition of Hope" for the Persian Gulf, Iran wants to ensure the security of shipping in the Persian Gulf together with the Arab Gulf states and without foreign protection powers.
India has a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
In fact, India would be predestined to be a "war-winner" in a global way. In view of the far-fetched tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump on Chinese manufacturers, China is forced to dispose of foreign producers in the People's Republic of China. Heads of Finance of Asian companies, who are considering turning their production from China to another country, are not willing to do so.
But now India itself is in Trump’s focus. Devalued by the White House as a “kingdom of tariffs”, America has deprived the emerging country of trade advantages for 2000 products in early June. The US accuses India of prohibitively high tariffs and demands better market access for more motor goods, spirits, mobile phones, etc.
On the world map of the trade wars, the rubbish with India is certainly just a sideshow. In addition, America considers the world's largest democracy also by the security policy glasses. Delhi and Washington combine the concern about China's claims to power in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a salve of American Prime Minister's unpunished charges against India has become so courageous.
The problem, however, lies in another place: the empirically hardened thesis that open markets are accelerating economic development has a serious state of affairs in the Socialist Republic of India. Also under modes. Its reform eagerness is mainly aimed at bureaucratic insanity, which is now gaining a high level of education for many peoples everywhere.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From an economic point of view, much has turned out to be better in India in the first five years of the modus operandi. But this does not apply in trade policy. This accelerates the protection of internationally uncompetitive companies from foreign suppliers.
In the West, fashions are tied to the nimbus of the energetic reformer, who cursively renews his country's business in a radical way. This impression is not least due to the fact that the charismatic prime minister only knows too well what the vocabulary of Western managers is. At the core, the "India First" advocacy of the political party, cursively and protegely, is not inferred to the political
Jacques Chirac's funeral in Paris on Monday
Former French President Jacques Chirac is due to be buried in Paris next week, according to a report. The former head of state will be buried on Monday at the cemetery of Montparnasse in the south of the French capital, the news agency AFP reported, citing the Chiracs family day. The funeral will be held in the parish.
Aimed at competitors: Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Athletics Championships
The top of the world was already at the finish line, when the two cooled Khalifa International Stadium were still playing the warm-hearted scenes. The finish line was still at the bottom. In the first run of the men over 5000 meters, Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to swing dangerously. He could barely stand 300 meters before the finish, while the goal was still under his legs.
"I just wanted to help him. Anybody in this situation would have done the same thing," said Dabo Umlaufen once after the race in Mixed Zone. He was rebounded to the attention of the assembled journalists completely unexpectedly. Shyly he had not wanted to help at all to talk about his heroic act. After all, he would only want to be rebounded from his personal best time and realize that
He did this that evening with emphasis - and much more intense than he would have imagined. Because this heroic act will remain in memory. Especially Dabo even left his competitor Busby in the finish line and voluntarily took the last place - by the way, well five minutes after the end of the Ethiopian help Selemon dis Barega, who had not won much at the finish line because of the goal of the world.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies there in Lisbon, had started to set a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha. According to official data, he managed to do so with 18:10.87 minutes, but he was disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. I was already under 18 minutes". However, only in training, there is no best time.
Millions: Egyptians prepare for wild protest day
In Egypt, security measures have been stepped up in the run-up to possible government-critical protests, with an intensified police presence in central Cairo on Friday. Several subway stations remained closed, roads around central Tahrir Square were blocked.
Already in recent days, police had tightened their street controls and partially searched pedestrians’ phones for news and photos related to the protests, with hundreds arrested, according to two non-governmental organizations.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
Last weekend, there were millions of protesters in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura who came to protests for "Mansours in the hundreds of participants". They attacked the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who criticizes corruption and mismanagement. Such an open protest against the political leadership had not been in Egypt for years, there had been protests against the "Mansours of the Egyptians" in the most of the Egyptian Exile.
The number of arrests in connection with the protests continued to rise, according to two observer groups. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests until Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported that there were no confirmations of more than 2,000 arrests.
Arbitrary arrests
Many people were "willfully arrested" "only because they were 'at the wrong time in the wrong place'", HRW said, citing lawyers, but the accusations against the detainees range from "spreading false information" to being in a "terrorist association" and being in a "terrorist association".
HRW also criticized the censorship in the North African country, saying the government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services to prevent further protests against Sisi.
Online retailers: shipping retailers should be able to donate returns more easily
For online retailers, many returned packages are lost goods. Around 20 million returns land on the trash. But there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online merchants like Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
While companies cannot be exempted from sales tax on donations of property, the ministry said on a question from the Greens-Bundestag faction, about which the newspapers of the Funke media group reported on Friday, but traders could put the market value of non-sales returns so low that they would have to pay no or only little sales tax.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had determined that the federal citizens return every sixth package when ordering on the Internet. Around four percent of the goods - around 20 million products - subsequently landed in the trash. Donating them would cost the companies additional money, according to the current legal situation, because the financial authorities assess donations as a sales tax.
Green Group leader Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify with a decree that companies can evaluate non-marketable products accordingly and donate free of charge to non-profit organizations. The companies should be able to rely on others not to be penalized for donating to the online business, but not just for building.
Banksy Art for Auction: There Has Never Been a Better Time to Sell This Painting
Streetart-star Banksy's famous work, "Developed Parliament", is set to be auctioned off soon.
For Branczik, Banksy's work emphasizes "the re-establishment of the world's oldest parliamentary democracy into the fundamentals of animal and tribalism." Starting on Saturday, the painting will be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital until it is to be auctioned on October 3, estimated at 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Museum of Bristol in southwestern Britain, where Banksy lives. This year the artist had the painting again exhibited - at the same time as the original Brexit date on March 29. On this occasion, the work, formerly called "Question Hour", was renamed "Developed Parliament".
The picture could change the owner for a million dollars.
Last week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, at the first session of the House of Commons following the lifting of a forced pause imposed by Johnson by the Supreme Court, delivered a hard blow exchange with the opposition. Johnson wants to carry out the already twice postponed Brexit on October 31, if necessary without a deal with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, has interfered in the Brexit debate. In Dover in the south-east of England, he painted a picture depicting a man who smashes a star of the European flag with a chisel. The work sees thousands of truck drivers and other visitors every day at the entrance of the United Kingdom.
Brexit debate is like a ‘walk in the park’
The fierce verbal attacks of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit opponents in parliament, according to his top adviser, do not contribute to a climate of hatred. Compared to the campaign before the Brexit referendum in 2016, the current controversy is a "walk in the park", said Dominic Cummings on Friday at a book presentation. "We will be enjoying this.
Johnson had attacked Brexit opponents in parliament in recent days and accused them of, among other things, "betrayal" of the people. Accusations that he could endanger lawmakers because they could be targeted by assassination threats, he dismissed as a "humbug".
Cummings said the only way to restore peace would be if MEPs finally respected the British decision to leave the EU. It is not surprising that people were upset that Britain still had not left the EU three years after the referendum.
In the face of the charged mood, even the bishops of the Anglican Church on Friday called for restraint. "We should talk to each other with respect," it said in a statement. "And we should also listen."
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan calls for UN intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict during his first appearance before the UN General Assembly.
Otherwise, a new war between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India would be likely, Khan said Friday at the UN General Debate in New York. "If it goes badly, hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst." The United Nations should have had a responsibility to prevent Kashmir.
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them around the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers each dominate part of Kashmir, another part belongs to China. In early August, India had withdrawn the Indian Kashmir region's autonomy status, thus increasing tensions in Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
Protesters in Cairo are calling for the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
Against the current protests in Egypt, the government reacts with a hard hand. It shoots at the population with sharp ammunition, more than 2000 prisoners join in prisons to the 60,000 political prisoners who already sit there. Protesting in Egypt has never been harmless. But since the takeover of power by General Fadel in 2013, everything has been done in the state of Stharyan.
But one of the triggers for the 2011 protests was the poor economic situation. Poverty, perspectivelessness and the feeling of being strangled by one’s own government drove millions into the streets. And this is a problem that also the regime of el-Sisi does not get under control, no matter how badly the situation has been against opponents.
Today, one third of the population in Egypt is already living below the poverty line. Since 2016, the share of the population has lost more than half of its value. The inflation rate is ten percent. Anyone who wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket has to decide who is financing: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only the most expensive, but also the most expensive.
Tüv tests in the terminal: BER-Chef: No more "showstoppers" for capital airports
For two months, it was checked whether the complex system mesh in the BER fire protection works in tandem. The operators are satisfied with the course. But the tüv is not yet finished at the BER.
After extensive Tüv inspections at the terminal of the future capital airport, operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year, which is certain, said Supervisory Board Chairman Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the Supervisory Board.
Airport manager Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successfully completed test, but also said that there are still deficiencies in the terminal. "We have a lot of detailed topics, but we do not have a real showstopper." He assured that the schedule until commissioning still contains buffer.
However, there are indications that the temporal reserve is no longer expected to be too large. The construction completion notice is now to be submitted to the construction office during the first quarter of 2020, at the beginning of the year this was planned for this autumn.
Hundreds of defects in power cables are still to be corrected; the Tüv wants to examine them until February. "In order to create the conditions for the start of flight operations here, intensive work must continue to be done on the handling of the defects," it said in a written statement.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is a lack of evidence, less about new cables. There is also no release for all the dowels on which the cable tracks hang. The airport manager expects that this will be available by the end of the year.
In addition, the fire protection at the crossing to the station under the terminal is still not working satisfactorily. The problems had already led the project to another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoke aprons that shut down in the event of a fire like a screen, so that the smoke does not spread. You have to go too far down. 36 engines must be replaced with new gas.
Problems with fire protection and other construction defects as well as planning errors have been delaying the opening of the airport for years. It was originally scheduled to go into operation in 2011. Since the start of construction in 2006, the cost has increased from two billion to expected around 6.5 billion euros to be opened next year.
Since the number of passengers in Berlin has increased significantly since then, the authorities are planning to expand the airport, which is why it is expected to be held in a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on October 18, as the chairman of Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Head of Finance Heike Fölster will move to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, Chief of Staff Manfred Bobke-von Camen will retire next year, Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She has put the airport finances on firm feet.
Chemnitz: Machines exploded for drugs - police arrest man
He needed money for drugs - and for that he blew up several vending machines in the city of Chemnitz! Now the perpetrator is finally in custody!
Over the past two years, the number of cigarette and parking ticket machines exploded in Chemnitz and the region has risen sharply.
At the end of May, after two detonations, the police arrested a 33-year-old German man on Bürgerstraße and Weiterer Straße in Chemnitz.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigations into the carrying out of explosive explosions in the unit with a particularly serious case of the theft led by the Chemnitz criminal police, not only this suspicion against the 33-year-old was confirmed".
Faced with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now confessed to a total of eight acts.
The police spokesman: "With the prey he apparently financed his addiction to narcotics." Only four times between August 20, 2018 and May 31, 2019, the bomber blew up parking ticket machines on the Bürgerstraße.
The resulting total damage amounts to at least 60,000 euros!
The automaton bomber is now in custody, and police investigations against him continue.
It is conceivable that he was also responsible for further automatic explosions in Chemnitz and adjacent counties.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
In the middle of the price fight with low-cost airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, Lufthansa's subsidiary AUA takes over "the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna", a spokesman for the Austrian Airlines confirmed on Friday.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa low-cost airline Eurowings is thus de facto dissolved. Of the currently seven Eurowings aircraft, four remain in Vienna. This takes over the AUA from January 2020 in the "Wetlease", i.e. including Eurowings personnel. In Salzburg, three Eurowings jets will be stationed from Salzburg to Strewingen, Germany.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and network planning, the spokesman explained. The flight times should be adjusted to connecting flights. On the one hand, the aim is to strengthen the hub Vienna and on the other hand to expand the decentralized traffic from the federal states.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna only serves as "Production Company" for the Group's sister AUA 1, such as Barcelona and Rome would be served with AUA flight number, but mainly with Eurowings device. The on-board product should be adapted to those of Austrian Airlines, but not to those of Euroswing pilots.
After the Niki bankruptcy, a price fight broke out at Vienna airport. Ryanair's subsidiary Laudamotion announced on Thursday that it would increase its fleet in Vienna to 16 aircraft next summer. The Irish low-cost airline criticizes four Ryanair machines including crews for Vienna, also known as the "Weather".
Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary's campaign statement that Lauda will have overtaken the AUA in five years, AUA CEO Andreas Otto replied on Friday: "We will remain the number one at the site, in five, six or ten years."
Queen granddaughter Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children, the cousins were best friends. Now the last of the four is married. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) is said to have stopped by the hand of his girlfriend Princess Beatrice (31) during the Italian holidays earlier this month, the palace announced on Thursday.
“We are extremely excited to announce our engagement, and we are both so excited to embark on this adventure together and can’t wait to be actually married,” the couple, who have been together since October 2018, said in a statement.
"We share so many similar interests and values and we know that this will help us a lot in the coming years full of love and happiness."
Sister Eugenie took the pictures
The official engagement photos have been taken by her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and also immediately posted on her Instagram account.
A Royal Feast
The wedding is scheduled to take place in 2020. More information about the date, place and everything else will be announced by the palace in the coming months.
It is certain, however, that the marriage of the number nine of the British succession and the real estate mogul will be a celebration similar in size to the wedding of Eugenie on October 12, 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on Causes of Heart Diseases
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. But what really triggers a heart failure or a heart attack? Hamburg researchers now want to look closely at the heredity of 9000 healthy and sick people.
Through the analysis of the heritage of 9000 people, Hamburg and Swiss scientists want to find out in more detail the causes of cardiovascular disease.
The research project is the largest of its kind in the German-speaking region, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kühne Foundation is funding the project with 12.5 million euros. From Switzerland, the high-mountain clinic Davos, which belongs to the foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich participate.
Overweight, smoking and unhealthy diets are among the main influencing risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is only insufficiently known, it was said. Now the scientists want the complete equivalence of the hereditary heart to the equivalence of the heart with the equilibrium of the 8,000
Currently, more than 4,000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes are known to cause possible disease-causing changes in DNA - so-called mutations - said the clinic, adding about 200 each year.
According to the initiators, the aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of heart rhythm disorders, heart weakness and heart attacks. The data could also be useful in the research of other folk diseases, according to Stefan Blankenberg, Head of the University Center for Cardiac and Niebrain Diseases.
The Chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also emphasized that there is a strong desire to use the data also for the research of other diseases. The clinic of the Foundation in Davos treats so far mainly allergies. Now, at the local medical campus, his Bio for Cardiovascular Preferences will be open to the public.
The biosamples of the healthy participants come from Hamburgers, who also participate in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 subjects, according to the clinic, this is the largest local health study in the world. In hereditary deciphering, strict attention is paid to the protection of anonymized data, the scientists assured.
According to UKE, a person’s genetic material can now be decoded within 24 hours. The net cost of this is 1300 euros. The first gene sequencing worldwide, the results of which were published in 2001, has cost several hundred million euros. The study is expected to start on 1 October, all 9,000 samples should be analyzed by the end of 2020. The first results are expected in the following year.
Nigerian Police Release Hundreds of Abused Boys
In Nigeria, the police have released more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koran school. According to reports from residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the partially underage victims, police spokesman Yakubu Sabo told them, “The victims were abused by inmates.
The boys were detained under the pretext of being taught in the Koran and being "improved"; in fact, the protectors were detained by their teachers under "the most degrading and inhumane conditions", Sabo said. About a hundred students, including children aged nine, were dressed in a small room.
The Koran school has been around for about ten years. Residents have alerted the authorities to repeated irregularities in the institution. The parents have been shocked when they were informed about the conditions in the Koran school, Sabo said. They had not been aware of the suffering of their children. The operator said
In the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria, there are many private Koran schools. They replace the often deficient state institutions. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to the UN Refugee Agency, therefore, over the past ten months more than 40,000 people have fled across the border to neighbouring states.
Nigerian police releases 400 children from school, jailed and tortured
Police have released nearly 400 students from horrific conditions in a school in northern Nigeria. "Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries that indicated torture," police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said in the city of Kaduna.
There the children were discovered on Thursday following a tip in an Islamic school, where the conditions were "unworthy" and officials arrested the headmaster and six teachers after the liberation campaign.
The children, all boys, were held as slaves at their school and put in chains. Some were sexually abused. Television images showed skinned and injured students in a recognizable poor state of health.
World Cup: More accusations against Messi and Klopp Kür
Football "Signature not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe awarded
With a gala in Milan, FIFA is the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Messi, it is the sixth honour and therefore a record.
After Nicaragua's captain declared that he had never voted in the world football election, accusations come from other countries to FIFA. Egypt was not evaluated at all - with a curious justification.
In recent years, many things have turned out to be reprehensible: the World Cup awards objectively, the dubious plans of its president Gianni Infantino, the general behavior of various corrupt officials. However, the FIFA world football election has not hitherto come into the suspicion that members of the national parliament are going to vote for it.
However, after the Nicaraguan captain had already complained that he had not voted at all, further inconsistencies are now emerging: Egypt complains that the voices of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. In fact, they appear in the official and publicly visible vote.
FIFA apologises insofar as "the signatures on the electoral forms were in capital letters and therefore not valid" and has contacted the Egyptian Federation several times to clarify the situation - without reply.
Sudan's coach also surprised
While the situation in the case of Egypt is comprehensible, the Sudanese association states that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was ultimately evaluated: with Lionel Messi voted in place one, Virgil van Dijk in two and Sadio Mané in three, so be the one with Verbandes su. Laut Fifa
Nicaraguan captain Juan Barrera also made accusations: "I did not vote for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All the information about my vote is wrong, thank you," he wrote. In his case, it was suspected that the Nicaraguan Football Association simply voted in his name.
On Friday, the association now received the message: True, but was of course no intention. The completed electoral documents were "erroneously" with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, it was stated in a message of the association. The association had also voted for the second captain.
The other cases have now been investigated by FIFA, but it stresses that the election process was supervised externally by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers, so long as Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the world football election - and Jürgen Klopp World Coach of the Year.
Ukraine affair: High-ranking Republicans speak out for official investigation
Two high-ranking Republicans have spoken out openly for an official investigation against the U.S. President and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said the Republican governor of the U.S. state of Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where this leads from here, will be determined by the facts that will be ascertained."
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations. These had shown that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj in a phone call to investigate the activities of Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine.
Republicans have so far been reluctant to criticize Trump over the whistleblower affair, with few showing discomfort about it. Scott's remarks are now a first sign of this in Trump's party. The moderate governor of Virginia had already repeatedly spoken out against Trump's policies, for example, against the easing of environmental protection.
As another senior Republican, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, spoke out for the investigation. "It's a deeply disturbing situation," Baker said. "The right course of action and responsibility for Congress now is to investigate the matter and go to the bottom of it."
Scott and Baker, as governors of U.S. states, have not formally participated in the proceedings against Trump, on which decisions are made in Congress. Their statements are therefore mainly symbolic. Nevertheless, even first senators of Republicans have expressed critically about the situation. Mitt Romney, who is referring to the state of Utah, for example, is saying that the U.S. is deepening its
The affair could lead to the initiation of an impeachment proceeding against Trump, which Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation into, accusing him of abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political gain.
There is no precise timetable for the impeachment process. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could seek a so-called impeachment. But the decision on an actual impeachment fell in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. The prospects for success of such a process are therefore low.
Were torturers aboard Racketes "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily, allegedly raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
German captain Carola Rackete (31) had been arrested in June after she had illegally docked the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees on board. After fierce protests and international criticism - also from Austria's Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was reduced by a small number of Italians.
Now, new serious accusations against racketeers are loud. So, three men accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived with the "Sea-Watch 3" in Italy. The suspects have been caught in a reception camp in Messina (Sicily) but the migrants have not been able to build up their information.
Police said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had been raped, tortured and even murdered. These were Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and brutalized by the division there.
NGOs and aid organizations are now pointing out that they cannot know exactly who is coming to the ships. "We can't scan who the people are. They come without passports," said Neugebauer. Torture is one of the main reasons why people are fleeing Libya. It is therefore quite likely that perpetrators will find themselves on the ships "very important".
Italy’s right-wing former Interior Minister Matteo Salvini called for an immediate apology from Rackete, who is still under investigation in Italy for aid to illegal immigration.
Musk Sets Extradition Record for Tesla
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers.
“We have a chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries,” Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog “Electrek”.
Demand is strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, Musk said in a circular, and the challenge is to quickly bring the cars to customers, and Tesla must offer as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla’s shares went out of trading with a gain of more than six percent. So strong the price has not increased in almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered well 95,000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to reach his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers must be produced in the current and next quarter. Above all, the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there was a loss last
U.S. budget dispute: once again only one bridge financing
The new fiscal year will begin in the United States on October 1 without a proper budget. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on a transitional funding until November 21.
Although the U.S. Congress and President Donald Trump in August still have to agree on an increase in spending caps for the fiscal years 2020 and 2021, the United States before the new fiscal year starting on October 1 is once again without spending plans. The Senate would have followed a House of Representatives on Thursday and has a transitional funding on November 21.
Shutdown averted
For the time being, the federal administration will now be funded at the level and according to the priorities of the spending plans for the fiscal year 2019 ending on Monday. This is because the Congress has not been able to agree on the 12 spending laws in time, which will allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities. The federal administration can not proceed to the new budget for $ 1, the government can not maintain the funds for $ 1.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have a majority, but the spending laws reflect the priorities of the Democrats, who have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate. Conversely, the Senate also has ten of the twelve spending plans more or less ready, which are barely capable of a majority.
The ghosts are already diverging mainly on the topic of resource allocation for the area of domestic security and border security. In the Senate, Republicans are apparently trying to force $ 12 billion for the construction of the wall, one of the major priorities of President Trump. The Democrats have been bothering about the wall building plans and on whose financing it had been slash-down on the project, which was actually built for other militaries.
At the masonry, the spirits separate
At the moment, it is unclear how the parties want to approach this issue. More likely than an agreement on all 12 spending laws in the next seven weeks is an extension of transitional funding beyond November 21st. A shutdown is not excluded at that time either.
In view of the continuing inability of Congress to agree on the twelve spending laws in time, and the associated danger of a shutdown, ideas to automate the process of popularity will gain. Template S. 1877 to avoid shutdowns would automatically reduce the funding of the federal administration each year to the previous year's level of travel, and will continue to increase the level of travel of the federal government.
France Allows Artificial Insemination for Lesbians and Singles
In France, artificial insemination will also be open to single women and lesbians in the future: The Paris National Assembly voted with a large majority in favour of a government bill according to which all women can use in vitro fertilization, which is expected to significantly increase the demand for anonymous sperm donations.
The proposal still needs the approval of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right-wing camp had warned that in the future many "children without a father" could grow up. The French bishops' conference is also against the innovation.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law that Health Minister Agn<0xC3><0xA8>s Buzyn defended as a "chance" for society. It depicts the modern family in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to their idea, the cost of artificial insemination for all women should be paid by social security.
Fertilization with sperm from dead husband banned
With a narrow majority, the National Assembly rejected an amendment that would give widows access to the sperm of their dead husbands for an artificial insemination. In Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom, artificial insemination is allowed "post-mortem". In Germany, there were then a number of cases of insemination in the past.
Many members of the ruling party La République en Marche (The Republic in Motion, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition had spoken out against artificial insemination with the sperm of the deceased partner. They emphasized that a widow will also be given a "doubled sorrow" due to the death of her children.
The initiators of the now-failed amendment consider it unfair that in the future, a widow may get fertilized with the sperm of a stranger, but not with that of her own partner.
So far, in France, artificial insemination is only allowed for heterosexual couples who cannot have children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that maternity will continue to be prohibited.
In Germany, artificial insemination is theoretically open to all women - however, it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Climate Compensation: Calls for Airfare for Unis to be louder
There is a lot of flying at the universities. That is why the country wants to have a climate tax carried out there in the future. The rectors say they have no money for it. But now they are also under pressure internally.
The universities should also restrict themselves to flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Stratenschulte
The discussion on a climate tax on flights from universities and universities, which had already been postponed before the summer break, still seems to be in full swing again because of the fact that the pre-rectors' conference was skeptical of a corresponding push from the green-black coalition, the plans are now receiving support from the universities. In a joint statement, the pre-rectors' flights are appealing to the University of Baden-Württemberg.
Russia to recapture North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB intelligence service, the detainees reportedly fished illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea had already been arrested. At that time, there was a change of fire between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and one North Korean were injured, but the fisherman suffered serious injuries later.
The communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages. The North Korean fishermen were therefore traveling in Russian territorial waters. There the coast guard of Russia, according to its own information to protect their marine biological resources patrols.
30,000 ink fish seized
During the re-inspections, 30,000 squid were discovered and seized on the boats, and three fishing boats and two motor boats were seized and brought to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok.
The Russian fishing authority had not issued fishing licenses to North Koreans this year, even after complaints from local businessmen, and thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been temporarily detained there this year, according to media reports.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the far-eastern region of Primorye, Georgi Martynov, recently also complained of high ecological damage by the North Korean fishermen. They were fishing with prohibited in Russia narrow mesh synthetic nets. With these would be taken to the sea, they would also be taken to the sea to 200 small creatures where they would be taken from the sea.
In the future, only 18,000: U.S. lowers asylum limit
The "greatest nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country in the world is shying away from asylum seekers: As confirmed by the foreign ministry in Washington, the upper limit for the legal entry of refugees is further lowered. In the future, especially endangered believers and Iraqis will receive asylum.
The U.S. government wants to lower the already historically low limit for the admission of new refugees once again. In the 2020 fiscal year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people are to be allowed into the country, as the U.S. Department of State stated. In the now almost expired 30,000 people are still at the end of the fiscal year.
President Donald Trump’s administration has drastically reduced readiness for asylum seekers from around the world in recent years, with the previous administration of Barack Obama targeting far higher admission limits.
The target of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the U.S. refugee program was introduced in 1980, but the U.S. Department of State called the United States "the most merciful and generous nation in history," a phrase that strongly recalls the language used by the incumbent U.S. president.
A "responsible approach" to refugees aims to allow refugees to return to their home countries to help rebuild there, Trump said. He gets a lot of support from supporters for his tough course in migration policy, but there is also massive criticism.
A major point of contention is the border with Mexico, which Trump wants to lock down. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the National Emergency. Whether there is a temporal link between the current measure and the current domestic political developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because of a skepticism.
The U.S. government intends to focus on the reception of two groups of refugees: people persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are thus in danger, as the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is supposed to show.
The U.S. wants people from this "Northern Triangle" of Central America to apply for asylum in other countries in particular. Against this background, the United States has only concluded migration agreements with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras to curb immigration at the U.S. southern border to Mexico.
Court orders release of orangutan from zoo
An orangutan female has been transferred from the former zoo of Buenos Aires to a detention center for monkeys in the United States at the request of the Argentine judiciary. The "Sandra" born in 1986 in the Rostock zoo was granted the rights of a "non-human person", therefore, her release was declared as mandatory in the case of Dolage, and her release was not mandatory in the case of Dolage.
As the 53 kilogram human affinity is unable to adapt to life in the wilderness, it is expected to live in the open-air enclosure of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There are already 21 more orangutans and 31 chimpanzees housed, among them "Bubbles", formerly pet of pop star Michael Jackson's Zo Quarwicka.
"Sandra" spent several years in Rostock after her birth in the former Ruhr Zoo in Gelsenkirchen, before moving to Buenos Aires in 1995. The 2014 process for "Sandra" fundamental rights, which was strained by animal rights advocates, has helped to transform the zoo of Buenos Aires into an eco-park of the kind and to preserve it as an eco-park.23
Record for Swiss Extreme Mountaineering: 550 meters in 46 minutes
Extreme mountaineering climber Dani Arnold has managed a new Husaren ride on the almost 3,000-metre-high Great Cinnamon in the Italian Alps.
Without a net, double floor or other aids, the Swiss forced the 550-metre-high north wall of the Große Zinne into a new record time.
Dressed in jeans, T-shirts and only supported by absolute dizziness, Arnold took 46 minutes and 30 seconds to climb, thus undercutting the old best brand by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now the record holder in Free Solo Speed on four of Europe’s six most important northern walls.
Nike Takes Advantage of New Online Marketing Strategy
U.S. sports goods manufacturer Nike posted a significant profit gain despite the trade conflict with China. Net profit rose to $1.4 billion in the past quarter (almost 1.3 billion euros). This is 25 percent more than in the previous year's period, as the Group's new customer strategy announced on Tuesday.
In the three-month period to the end of August, sales rose to $10.7 billion. Nike sales increased the most in China by a 22 percent increase. Thus, the Beaverton-based company in the U.S. state of Oregon also benefited in the People's Republic of Oregon from its approach to direct sales via the Internet or smartphone apps.
Chief Financial Officer Andy Campion announced that with strategic investments, Nike will continue to advance the "digital transformation" of the sports goods manufacturer and thereby expand its competitive advantage. Investors reacted enthusiastically to the quarterly figures - the shares of the sports goods manufacturer increased by more than five percent.
Lifelong ban on stadiums due to racism in Italy
Due to racist comments about football pro Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the club from the Italian capital has imposed a 28-year-old stadium ban on AS Roma at the time of a fan. The defender Jesus from Brazil had been insulted by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and asked his club to take action with St. "<0x40>FanacialRomas.
The club reacted late Thursday, reporting the fan's account on Instagram and the police, and the Roma fans are never allowed to visit a club game again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. He regularly scannies Italian fans against racist insults against black players AC rival teams. "We can not have racism in society or in sport. In Italy the situation has not improved, and this is very serious. One must identify the perpetrators of the attacks and throw them out of the stadiums.
But there had also been discussions about the supporters of Juventus Turin lately. The Italian authorities have now banned 38 roaming fans of record champion Juventus Turin with stadium bans. Four of them are not allowed to enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police informed.
The fans are in connection with ongoing investigations against 12 leaders of ultra-fan groups around Juventus, who are accused of heavy blackmail, money laundering and private violence. The club had launched the investigations with an announcement last year.
According to Italian media reports, the ultra-leaders are behind the black-trade. They have "militarily controlled" the ticket trade for the fan curve and allegedly blackmailed Juventus employees to get cheaper tickets.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, Generation Z is political - whole vintages are thought out with catchy names. Take a closer look, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the respective feeling of life of young people?
"The crabs are coming!" This call officially launched on September 21 the crab fishing at Gucheng Lake in Gaochun, which also inaugurated the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Department of Public Affairs of the Nanjing Gaochun District Committee.
Gaochun, which forms the southern outskirts of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, of course, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and here is also the Chinese headquarters of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has great percentage of environmental conditions. The city has to be about 50 percent of the ideal conditions with a mixture of water and water.
The people in Gaochun have already started to grow crabs in the early 1990s. Over time, the crab industry has developed into a distinctive industry that provided high incomes and became an important part of the economic development of Gaochun. In recent years, Gaochun has actively developed into a large-scale, ecological and scientific development of crabs.
In recent years, Gaochun has advanced a reform to "distribution of power, optimization of administration and of government services" and carefully built the service network for "approvals under one roof, a team for law enforcement, a network for services, a platform for lending", thus optimizing the city's environment for approvals and services, for

Iran-US conflict: Rouhani talks about end of sanctions - Trump contradicts
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has spoken after his return from the UN General Assembly about an alleged U.S. offer to lift sanctions, and in return for talks with the Tehran leadership, the United States has put an end to all sanctions, Rouhani said on his official website.
U.S. President Donald Trump, however, contradicted his Iranian counterpart on Twitter: “Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on him so that there would be a meeting.
Ruhani describes the event as follows: Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and insisted that a meeting be held. "And America says I have lifted the sanctions," added Dehani.
However, this push did not take place in an acceptable way, criticized Rouhani. Given the current punitive measures and "the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure", no one can predict the outcome of negotiations.
Earlier this week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Rouhani in New York. Background was the hope of the Europeans to save the nuclear agreement negotiated with Russia and China with Iran. This is intended to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. French President Emmanuel Macron had as Merkel is meeting with the U.N. General Assembly.
Heavy earthquake near Istanbul - Nearly 200 aftershocks
After western Turkey was shaken by two earthquakes within a short time, the fear of a catastrophe is growing. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the quake on the day before, there have been almost 200 aftershocks, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
14 schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings were damaged. The 5.8 magnitude earthquake had shaken the Marmara region in front of Istanbul on Thursday and triggered panic in the million-strong metropolis. Now the government wants to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future.
In the last 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is repeatedly ignored. Poorly built residential houses collapse every year - among other things, caused by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
Urban planners such as the well-known architect Mucella Yapici have been warning for years that large open areas, which were registered in the center as a refuge, have long been added. It was not until the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük earthquake in August that the Istanbul Chamber of Civil Engineering had warned that estimated a million buildings in Istanbul were not safe.
The epicentre of Thursday’s quake was in the Marmara Sea in front of Silivri district, about seven kilometers deep, as the Disaster Relief Authority said, and a smaller aftershock a few minutes later caused even greater panic on the streets.
Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said on Twitter that no injuries or damage had been reported at first. The state broadcaster TRT showed people running out of houses in panic. Students were taken out of buildings in Silivri district for security reasons. Some students were crying as they could be seen in pictures.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. Under the Sea of Marmara lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian Disorder, which marks the border between the Eurasian and Anatolian plateaus. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the deadliest was the earthquake in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time, more than 17000 people died.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 to 7.4 could threaten, but it is unclear when the quake will hit the west of the country and Istanbul on Thursday.
Companies design emergency plans, private individuals have so-called go-bags packed with everything necessary standing next to front doors, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth is shaking. When the next big quake will come, be unclear.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on his return from New York that eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered minor damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu was following developments from the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Center (Akom). According to him, two minarets of Avmirci and a minaret of mosques in Bezlar fell.
Warning of aftershocks in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users of panic reported. Buildings shook. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines were interrupted. It was more violent than that of Tuesday, writes a user. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Clinic, had warned via Twitter of imitations. He called on the people to stay away from the buildings.
According to CNN Turkey, the time of the quake is officially stated at 13:59 (local time) and just minutes after the first quake, there was a aftershock, which was indicated with a magnitude of 4.0 on the judge scale.
Only on Tuesday, an earthquake of magnitude 4.6 had shaken the Turkish Marmara region - it was felt up to Istanbul. Also its epicenter was located in the Marmara Sea west of the million-strong metropolis, the disaster protection authority Afad announced on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that made headlines on Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Scientists assume that a catastrophic earthquake could occur in Istanbul sooner or later - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually discharge - and cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects that the earthquake is now a warning. It has become more likely, he told CNN Turk. "These could be the signs of a bigger earthquake," Ersoy told the broadcaster. "Sooner or later, the big earthquake will also come."
There had already been an incident a few weeks ago - the quake also caused great concern in Istanbul. In addition, in Albania there had only been a violent earthquake a few days ago - there were 68 injured. Also at Lake Constance this year, the earth had been shaking.
Parliament: New ignition in Ukraine affair
Two brittle documents provide new ignition in the Ukraine affair for possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible impeachment proceedings, US Democrats see themselves reinforced: The President filed a complaint about Trump and his controversial phone call to the Ukraine.
United States: United Airlines passenger locked in toilet - plane rerouted
A United Airlines flight has been rerouted because a passenger was locked in the board toilet, and the toilet door was blocked during flight 1554 from Washington to San Francisco, the airline said.
During an unplanned stopover on Wednesday night in Denver, the woman was finally able to be released from the narrow cabin, where she was locked up for about an hour, U.S. media reported, citing other passengers, who had to change the machine to fly on to San Francisco.
In a video posted on the Internet, which is said to originate from Flight 1554, according to U.S. media, several people are trying to free the woman. "We are currently working on opening the door, ma'am. We'll get you out soon, okay?" says one man. The airline has apologised to all of the passengers.
The cockroach: Inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit novel
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with all the Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka’s famous short story “The Transformation”, the British success author Ian McEwan (71) wrote a book about the Brexit chaos in the UK.
The novel "Die Kakerlake" (Original: "The Cockroach") will never be published in German on November 27, the Diogenes Verlag (Zurich) announced. It is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his previous life, but now he is the most powerful man in the world.
McEwan was quoted with the words: "When the parliament is closed, so that the government can not be challenged at a critical moment, when ministers are shamelessly lying like the Soviet leaders once, when Brexiteers in high positions are almost begging the catastrophe of a no-deal - then I just have to ask a writer about what he is doing.
Kafka's 1915 first-published story is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself "turning into an enormous insect", gradually being excluded from family and society, and eventually dying. "Ian McEwan bows before Kafka to describe a world that stands headlong," it was from Dio.
EU invests <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9.5 million in Austrian rail infrastructure
11,200 wagons in Austria and Hungary will be fitted with whistle-blower brakes to reduce noise from freight trains, and sections of the railway connections between Graz and Györ and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron will be modernised and electrified.
According to the EU Agency, this is to make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions. The funds come from the EU infrastructure pot "Connecting Europe Facility".
Thomas Cook: All trips canceled until October 31st
The German tour operator Thomas Cook has canceled all trips one day after his insolvency application until October 31, 2019. Travels could "not be entered for insolvency reasons", the company announced on Thursday evening.
This will also affect bookings of the Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, <0xC3><0x96>GER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin brands, which have already been paid or fully paid for. As it stands for travel starting from November 1, 2019, the company left open. In accordance with the insolvency insurance, it will be pre-checked.
Thomas Cook in Germany was in the grip of the bankruptcy of the British parent company and had filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday. The company, which includes Neckermann Reisen, <0xC3><0x96>ger Tours and Bucher Reisen, employs about 2000 people in Germany.
Insurers want to send money back to hotels
On the other hand, from this Friday, hotels abroad, which are currently still hosting Thomas Cook holidaymakers, will receive money from Zurich insurance. Payments to the hotels are linked to the condition that holidaymakers are no longer required to make extra payments, according to Zurich.
On the basis of the booking information and without submitting separate invoices, the hotels in the resorts are now to receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich spokesman for the German press agency said. "This applies immediately and provided that Thomas-Cook-Travellers from these hotels will not be charged for any further individual payments from now on."
The insurance company reacted to reports of hotel guests who had been forced to pay for their accommodation on the premises themselves, some of whom had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centers had sharply criticized this.
How many hotels are affected will be matched with the insolvent travel provider on Friday, the insurance spokesman said. According to Thursday, 70,000 Thomas Cook holidaymakers were still travelling from Germany. Zurich Germany has secured holidays and return trips for Thomas Cook customers.
Insolvency administrators want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a future solution.
The now announced withdrawals to hotels by Zurich Insurance, however, only help travelers who are currently on the move. For Thomas Cook customers who want to fly only on holiday, it looks bad. Late Thursday evening, the company announced that all such trips, including 31 October, will be canceled.
As for travel starting from November 1, 2019, the company left open. In coordination with insolvency insurance, the further procedure will be reviewed, it was said. In principle, Zurich insurance is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new travel has been stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which can be represented by the company Kaera. Customers can find out about the possibilities of refunding the travel price on the Kaera website and make their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry Destroys Mines in Angola
Prince Harry continues the engagement of Lady Diana for a long time, and in Africa, he is now following in the footsteps of his mother.
Dressed in a blue splitter vest, British Prince Harry has set fire to a mine in Angola and destroyed it.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust near the town of Dirico, he set up the ignition circuit on Friday morning in front of running TV cameras. At a safe distance, the explosives exploded in the savannah landscape without causing any damage. Although the Halo Trust alone still has the more than 100,000 relics of the decade-long Confederate blu
On the fifth day of his trip to Africa, Harry wanted to walk directly in the footsteps of his mother Diana (1961-1997) in the city of Huambo. With the same explosive master, who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to take the path she went then. The pictures on which Princess Diana had demonstrated in 1997 through a cleared minefield had also been around support.
Harry, 35, and his wife, Meghan, 38, have been on a ten-day trip to Africa since Monday, which began in the South African tourist metropolis of Cape Town.
Brexit negotiations: The danger of a no-deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly set himself up again: with him there will always be a third postponement of the Brexit negotiations. But what statements have been made in the polarizing British of eternal duration. The most recent judgment of the Supreme Court in the United Kingdom has been hovering like a Damocles sword over the Parliament of the United Kingdom.
Boris Johnson says deal is still possible
However, the pressure does not seem to be noticeable on Johnson. Meanwhile, while visiting a hospital, he suggested that in the event of a disagreement, he would support an extension of the negotiations until the end of October:
You know, we're gonna stick to the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU by 31 October.
And best with a deal. I'm cautiously optimistic that this will work.
And time is running out for the Brexit negotiators in Brussels. Still around six weeks after Brexit, the EU and the British negotiators have no time to prevent a withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union without agreements. But even the recent talks could not have achieved a breakthrough. A deal for the end of October seems likely to be ahead of the Prime Minister's agenda.
U.S. authorities: More deaths from e-cigarettes
The number of deaths associated with the use of e-cigarettes in the United States has increased to twelve. In addition, there are now 805 confirmed and probable injuries in this regard, the U.S. health authority CDC reported. According to a study published in the "New England Journal of Users" there have already been more than 500 deaths.
The fear of new protests in Egypt is growing
Millions of times, the videos of Mohammed Ali have been shared in online networks. The Spanish-based construction contractor and actor calls for a "people's revolution". For today's Friday, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, which critics accuse of being part of corruption.
In any case, the security authorities are alarmed. In the center of Cairo there was already an increased police presence. Several subway stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir Square were blocked. Already in recent days, the police had reinforced their street controls with the most photos and the messages on the cellphones of pedestrians
On September 20, the demonstrators also gathered around Tahrir Square.
Last weekend, there had been protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants. Such an open protest had not been held in Egypt for years. Accordingly, the security forces reacted harshly. According to the Human Rights Watch (HRW) organization, they were called to the place because only last week they wanted to arrest almost 2000 people - many of them had been arrested on false charges.
The organization also criticized the censorship in the North African country. Accordingly, the government in Cairo blocked websites and online services to prevent further protests against al-Sisi. The general has ruled the country since 2013, after he toppled the democratically elected Islamist president Mohammed Morsi. Thousands of Islamists, pro-government opponents, bloggers and activists have been denounced.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fox from Greenland Expedition back
The polar explorer Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday and was greeted on his arrival in the port of Hamburg by skipper Boris Herrmann, climate activist Greta Thunberg on the race hunt "Malizia" across the Atlantic.
With a team of scientists, Fuchs has been studying and documenting the effects of global warming on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland in recent months.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, said the polar researcher. He has been waiting for years for the young generation to speak out. It has been known for decades that the Earth is warming. Yet many acted as if there was a planet B.
"What happens at sea often happens without the public knowing," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the melting of the seas. During the expedition, among other things, Greenland ice was measured with a drone and fished with nets for microplastics.
For his "struggle for a sustainable and respectful use of the world's seas" the polar explorer from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" during the Hamburg Climate Week. "For all of us who care about the survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs has a great role model in the last year's "Shipper Boris Zeihungen ist ein Preismann bei der Welt.
Expensive spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid 430 euros for noodles
<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>430 for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant not far from the Engelsburg in Rome: This seemed to be too much for two Japanese tourists. The bill of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>80 was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which triggered hot reactions.
"Such cases harm Rome's reputation, and we call on the police to investigate whether this is a fraud," a spokesman for Federagit, the Rome travel guides' association, told the Rome daily Il Messaggero (Friday edition).
The reaction of the owners of the restaurant came quickly. The Japanese had not only ordered spaghetti, but also fresh fish, justified the local owner. However, this is not to be taken from the bill. A tip of up to 20 percent of the bill is also normal, the host said.
After the turbulent revelations of recent days, U.S. President Donald Trump may actually be faced with an impeachment procedure, the Democrats want to examine this with their investigation in the House of Representatives now as soon as possible - the talk is from weeks until a decision would be made.
At the beginning of the scandal is supposed to be the phone call with the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj. The accusation of a whistleblower, who brought the conversation out of concern for national security and for the democracy of the United States with his complaint finally to the public, is monstrous: The President has the power to mislead the government of his office.
The core of this project can also be seen in the now published memo of the conversation with Selenskyj, although it does not reflect the full text. The July 25 phone call is only an episode of a much larger story, in the center of which stands, besides Trump, especially his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story is going to be very good for the public in May 2019, will be very good for me, as the New York Times of Rudy Giuliani reports on the travel plans to Ukraine. He wants to meet in Kiev with the newly elected President Selenskyj, and the lawyer knows very well that his intentions are sensitive. "We are not going to interfere in an election, we are going to be good"
The lawyer and former New York mayor seems to have infected with right-wing conspiracy fantasies fixed on Trump’s 2016 election contender: Hillary Clinton has conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics said at the time to construct an occasion for Russia investigations in the US.
This is about exactly the investigations about which Trump in July on the phone will talk so prominently with Selenskyj to his family. The version of Mr. Giuliani's and the president's comments is: The former vice president and currently prospective candidates for the presidential candidacy of the Democrats, Joe Biden, has been quoted as the Ukraine representative of the Obama administration on the resignation of Mr.
In fact, the course was somewhat different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian attorney general should go Obama, the investigations against the gas company were already completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected by it. Shokin was also accused of deeply corrupt behavior, the US government supported the company by far not the only one supporting him on the Western side.
Disturbances on Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users around the world report massive disruptions to Instagram and Facebook. Accordingly, especially Germany, the UK and Spain are affected. On the website allestörungen.de, users report that Facebook has not been loading again and again since about 3.30 p.m.
Instagram and Co. more often affected by disruptions
It’s not the first massive disruption this year. As early as March and July, services had been down for several hours. And as in previous cases, users are turning to Twitter again, especially this time to air their annoyance.
Polish scientists rescued in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists have been rescued by the Chilean Air Force from the ice of Antarctica. They were traveling on a hose boat and several miles from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in the misfortune - less than an hour needed the Chilean rescue helicopter for the rescue.
Eduardo Mosquera, commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"At 9:30 a.m. we received the message, at just ten we started, and good 20 minutes later we were over the hose boat".
Poland has operated the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977, 19 scientists work there. The frozen researchers were safely returned to their research station.
Warning: Smartphone NEVER charge wirelessly
Practical, but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Since several new smartphones have recently come on the market that support wireless charging and are selling very well - especially the new iPhone 11 models, we would like to recall a study from the beginning of July. The wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely convenient, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature adds battery
Researchers warn against the wireless charging of smartphones. This is according to the findings of the Univerity of Warwick in addition to the level of the device is extremely harmful. The reason for this is the significantly greater heat development. If you charge a mobile phone normally by cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees within three hours. When the wireless charging of the smartphone is done, the charger has the perfect charger.
Capacity and service life
Although, according to the researchers, the temperature for the durability of batteries is a decisive factor for iPhones. Costs of each individual degree plays a role. When charging with higher temperatures, the battery will not only retain capacity, but it will also not last as long. The service life is therefore lower than that. The researchers advise Apple to use a high-quality cable for this purpose.
Practical
The technology is extremely convenient: Simply put the device on a suitable charging pad - these are now even installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without annoying cable salad and tiring plugging. Because the technology is used in research with Qi (only used for inductive power transmission, it is available only in the case of Apple.
Everest Statue Photographer: 13 Eight Thousands in Six Months
A Nepalese mountaineer has climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world in just six months. Nirmal Purja (36) has reached the peak of Manaslu in Nepal and thus set a record, his expedition organizer announced.
The former soldier wants to climb all 14 eight thousand climbers in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He has already made international headlines: From him comes a photo of mountaineers that went viral in the spring, standing on the Mount Everest queue.
The image of the mass craze sparked a debate about stronger security measures on the 8,848-metre-high mountain and the highest peak on Earth. In May, eleven climbers had died during the ascent within a few days.
A problem for Purja could be the ascent of the 14th Eighth Thousand: Currently, Chinese authorities are blocking the Xixabangma Mountain in Tibet. The reason for this is called bad weather. Earlier this week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal's government wanted to talk to China to allow him the ascent.
Four Dead Elephants Discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals was also a pregnant elephant cow, a police spokesman said on Friday. "We suspect that the elephants were poisoned".
The four bodies were found in a protected area near the famous and visited by many tourists former rock fortress Sigiriya. According to the police spokesman, the animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, almost 200 elephants are killed every year. The perpetrators are often farmers on whose land the animals had previously been harmless. At the same time, around 50 people are killed annually by elephants. This usually happens when the animals move through villages built near their habitat.
In Sri Lanka, it is estimated that only about 7,000 elephants are still alive, and the death penalty is theoretically imposed on them.
British oil tanker to leave Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after its detention by Iran. This was announced by the Maritime Office Bandar Abbas according to the IRNA news agency. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had arrested the tanker flying the British flag on July 19 under the accusation of violating the Gulf regulations.
Management of Thomas Cook in Criticism
The competent Economic Committee of the House of Commons intends to investigate the bankruptcy of the travel giant Thomas Cook in a comprehensive manner. From the outset, it is intended to deal with the salary packages of the board of directors as well as the question of why the British government did not like to contribute financially to the company struggling for survival. "We have examined the external part of the supervision of the company as well as our interest in the company.
According to experts, genes are overestimated at risk of bowel cancer
The role of genes in the familial increased risk of bowel cancer has apparently been overestimated so far. To this conclusion, researchers from the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg come in a recent study. Other risk factors such as familial dietary habits are therefore likely to weigh more than individual estimates.
Elon Musk raises Tesla shares
Musk wrote this in an email to Tesla employees published on Thursday (local time) by the industry blog "Electrek" that the demand is strong so that Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it continued in Musk's circular.
The challenge is to quickly bring the cars to customers, and Tesla will have to offer as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla shares went out of trading with a gain of over six percent. So strong the price has not increased in almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered well 95,000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to reach his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers must be produced in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there was at last
Will the British government circumvent Brexit law? Johnson reluctantly
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is keeping himself covered up about whether he is looking for ways to circumvent the latest law passed by parliament against an unregulated Brexit. On a corresponding question on Friday, he told reporters only that his government would stick to current law.
The law requires the government to request a postponement of the withdrawal date, should no agreement with the EU be reached by mid-October, Johnson criticizes this as a "capitulation law" that complicates negotiations with the EU.
Former British Prime Minister John Major had suggested on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law, and he could use a procedural trick that postpones the entry into force of the law until after the EU exits.
Johnson said he aspires to a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on October 31, and the best way is to have an agreement."
Iran appears to be ramping up uranium enrichment
Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has increased the pressure on European Contracting Parties in the dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear agreement. "Unfortunately, European states show inability or lack of readiness when it comes to concrete actions," said Rouhani on Thursday at a press conference on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly's event, not saying that in New York.
The background is the conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which in return for Iran agreed on the commitment to Tehran to normalize economic relations. The United States withdrew from the agreement in 2018 alone to force Iran back to a change of course in the negotiations in the Middle East, which is considered to be an aggressive move by the President of the United States.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic is now using the centrifuges installed in early September with uranium, or at least preparing for use, and that Iran is preparing to build more than 300 more centrifuges, according to the IAEA.
Perhaps the Europeans were not ready to bear their share of the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the cost and burden of pressing US sanctions, Rohani suspected, but there will still be further talks that hopefully bring a solution.
Rouhani denies Iran's involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September, the situation has changed: Germany, France and the United Kingdom followed on Monday the US assessment that Tehran was responsible for the attacks. However, initially, the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels had not been known to have been attacking the United States.
"Those who raise such accusations must submit evidence to Mr. Johnson," said Mr. Rohani. However, the European leaders could not have done so during the talks with him during the UN general debate. Instead, they would have only relied on the fact that the rebels in Yemen could not have carried out an attack like this in the day of Mr. Emerson. Mr. Rohani
Before possible talks with U.S. President Trump, the U.S. administration’s far-reaching sanctions would have to be lifted first, Rouhani demanded, urging the government in Washington to shift to a policy of “dialogue and reason.”
Comet from another star crosses the solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of space. This was the first time before. The comet allows conclusions about other solar systems.
What was initially only a guess is now confirmed: an interstellar guest is crossing through our solar system. The comet from the depths of space was named 2I/Borisov after its discoverer and has aroused the interest of astronomers around the world.
The widely traveled comet was discovered on August 30 by amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissov at the Margo Observatory in the Crimea - using a self-built telescope of 65 centimeters in diameter. Follow-up observations from various observatories not only confirmed that it is an unknown comet, but also showed that it is not our
2I/Borisov is, after 1I/'Oumuamua from 2017, only the second interstellar object to be seen during a transit of our solar system.
2I/Borisov provides astronomers with a rare chance to get close insights into a strange solar system's orbits before it disappears on never-seeing. First observations show that the interstellar comet is similar to that of our own system, as reported by the astrophysical institute of the Canary Islands' orbits.
According to the analysis, the comet has been carried on a so-called hyperbel orbit that leads it out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) has announced. It is also responsible for the naming and categorization of celestial bodies. In honor of its discoverer, the interstellar number was given to the interstellar number C4.
Astronomers are lucky: Unlike 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in the approach. Thus, the researchers will remain for many months for investigations. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and will then be visible by April 2020 with medium-sized telescopes," explained Farnocchia. "Telesko will only be professionally seen with larger ones by October 2020."
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor. For example, a team around Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, determined in a first study the diameter of the celestial object at 2 to 16 kilometers.
Researchers of the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already discovered a first so-called spectrum of the interstellar sulfur star, which offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object must be similar to that of comets of our solar system, and this indicates that the composition of this object is similar to that of our solar system.
The discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years suggests, according to the IAU, that these objects could open up a new path to the exploration of certain processes in other solar systems. However, the frequency of such spot visits is still difficult to estimate. One of the next interstellar visitors to the space mission may be able to fly off.
By 2028, the agency intends to station the three-piece Comet Interceptor spacecraft at a waiting position 1.5 million kilometers from Earth. According to Esa Science Director Günther Hasinger, it is intended to either place it on an as-yet-untouched, fresh comet from our own satellite system.
First landing at Beijing's new Mega-Airport Daxing
Right before the 70th anniversary of the People’s Republic of China, the first passenger aircraft of China United Airlines has landed at the new mega-airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a special honor for the captain and crew.
By 2022, about 45 million passengers will be handled annually at the new airport, and by 2025 it will already be 72 million. Chinese President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion-dollar project. China’s latest prestige project is also called “sea stars” due to its six-storey building structure.
The complex has four runways, which will be expanded to seven, and is equipped with the world’s largest automatic air traffic management system. A new subway transports passengers to downtown Beijing in just 20 minutes.
Already during the construction, the Chinese had repeatedly stated that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the capital airport in Germany, which has been under construction since 2006 - and is much smaller - has been postponed until now. In Beijing, on the other hand, a first passenger machine landed after four years.
New supersonic aircraft to fly in 2030: in four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four-and-a-half hours - of which the British space agency UK Space Agency is dreaming of launching 20. Very likely to make this, aimed for the 2030s is a special supersonic flight engine (Synergetic Air-breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), which the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire could develop, the agency quoted the U.S. broadcaster as saying "The work of the
In order to advance the project, the British space agency wanted to work more closely with the Australian space agency. In order to develop the project, the British space agency wanted to work more closely with the Australian space agency. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolitan area currently takes about 20 hours. As the only supersonic aircraft for passenger transport, the Concorde had been operating from 1976 until the end of its operations in 2003.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport", writes Reaction Engines, among other things on its homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - this means five times as fast as the sound. In addition, such aircraft are also capable of being used outside of
Washington riots: Trump wants to track down anonymous tippers in Ukraine affair
In the Ukraine case of possible abuse of power by the US president, Donald Trump wants to track down possible leaks in the White House.
“I want to know who gave the whistleblower the information,” Trump told U.S. envoys at the United Nations in New York on Thursday, saying the person was “almost a spy” and that they had been treated “a little differently” in the past than they are today.
This was seen as an attempt at intimidation against tippers. The event was not actually public. However, several U.S. media broadcast audio clips of the address on Friday. Democrats reacted indignantly to the president's statement.
The Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives had announced preparations for an impeachment proceeding against Trump on Tuesday. Their accusations are mainly based on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence official who has made serious accusations against Trump and his government headquarters.
As part of his work, the whistleblower wants to have received information from several government officials that the U.S. president is “using the power of his office” to achieve another country interfering in the 2020 U.S. election in his favor.
At the center of the accusations is a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his counterparts to investigate what could harm his political rival Joe Biden. It is about protecting the former business of Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine,and the alleged accusations against him
The whistleblower also accused the White House of concealment with a view to the Ukraine telephony bank. According to the report, the government officials had made an effort to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the ceiling. As usual, an electronic wording protocol was only made out of data, but according to the report, this was made out of groovy words.
The identity of the whistleblower is not publicly known. The New York Times reported that it was an employee of the foreign intelligence agency CIA.
Trump again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the "so-called whistleblower" had disseminated second-hand information that would have turned out to be inaccurate. Therefore, there may not be any tipsters or spies at all.
As Trump spoke in New York about those who allegedly gave information to the whistleblower, but sparked outrage, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reacted with concern and lamented that Trump’s statement once again undermined the integrity of the government.
In the House of Representatives, various investigations against Trump and his environment have been going on for months in various committees, and in the face of Ukraine’s allegations, Democrats are now pursuing investigations with new vigor in order to launch a possible impeachment proceedings against Trump.
"The whistleblower has given us a timetable for our investigation," said the head of the intelligence committee in the House of Representatives, Adam Schiff. Trump attacked ship sharply, accused him of misrepresenting things, and again called for the resignation of the committee chairman.
More than 300 former U.S. security and foreign policy officials, who were mostly working under Democratic but also Republican presidents, stood behind the Democrats' investigation into a possible impeachment process in a statement released on Friday.
There is no precise timetable for the next procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could strain a so-called impeachment procedure. But the decision on an actual impeachment fell in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. The prospects for success of such a procedure have therefore not been much of an impeachment.
VW Operations Council: Workplaces are being 'slipped'
The plans of the VW brand to further reduce costs in production could be at the expense of manufacturing in Germany and Europe. This concern is driving the company's operating council around. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs by two billion euros by 2023. Of which 500 million euros will be allocated this year.
A key factor in this is personnel costs. The "future pact" negotiated between companies and the works council in 2016 already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany by 2020 alone. In principle, a job can only be reduced by the car manufacturer if it is proven that the related activities are no longer necessary. In addition, an employment guarantee is valid until 2029.
However, as our newspaper has now learned from operating council circles, jobs in production that are not actually available are being "slipped" down a different path - i.e. past the official course. Thus, freeing up regular posts would often not be re-filled.
In these cases, the works council has no way of forcing the re-creation. In the meantime, there is a shortage of staff in many places, the work condensation is increasing, the concerns about a gradual bleed out of the vehicle factories would be greater. In this way, there is also a growing fear that the production of vehicles could be gradually withdrawn from Germany and Europe.
The VW brand wants to standardize production worldwide even more and centrally control new projects. This also aims to reduce costs and speed up decisions - behind this is the goal of increasing productivity and thus competitiveness. Production CEO Andreas Tostmann said at a managerial conference in Berlin: "It is precisely in uncertain times between Brexit and trade that we are in danger of making a crisis between China and the USA.
For example, for the first time since 2013, production costs per vehicle would fall compared to the previous year. Tostmann told reporters that the production time for the Golf 8, which is to be presented on 24 October in Wolfsburg, will be reduced by 1.1 hours. Exact figures on the production time VW does not call it Golf 7 according to our time
20 hours.
In our region, the Wolfsburg main plant is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. The Braunschweig and Salzgitter plants produce components. For VW-internally, the rule of thumb applies that 800,000 cars must be built there annually, so that the plant is profitable. In 2018, the demand for new vehicles was only around 70 %. This was due to the demand for the WOLFSTAG-LIGHT-GANG-T-G-G-G-L-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G
As production manager Tostmann already announced last year, however, in Wolfsburg "perspectively" one million cars are to roll off the band. This is to make the bundling of the golf production in the main plant possible - because the Zwickau plant, through the conversion to the site for the production of electric cars, gives up the golf production.
In addition, the SUVs Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are being produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales figures of Golf and Tiguan have recently declined. Therefore, expectations are now resting on the Golf 8. It should remain the bread and butter car of the Wolfsburgers for the time being, despite all efforts to build up e-mobility.
Voodoo Forced into Prostitution: Traffickers Convicted
Young Nigerian women have been sworn in, dragged into the Ruhr area and forced into prostitution, and six suspected human traffickers must go to jail for doing so.
Six suspected human traffickers from Nigeria were sentenced to up to eight years and three months in prison in Bochum on Friday. The defendants had dragged young Nigerian women into the Ruhr area and forced them into prostitution. To force their obedience, the exiled women had to leave their homes.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought across the Mediterranean with the help of Libyan sloops in dinghies. However, the dream of a better future did not come true. In Germany, they were distributed on various brothels to handle the alleged sloop costs of an average of 25,000 euros. Their wages were therefore completely reduced.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the incarceration and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerian women on brothels in the process. "The work made it difficult for women to create physically and mentally," Judge Isabel Hoffmann said at the verdict. "Some were rightly opposed."
The verdicts were on the commercial and gang-like insurgency of foreigners, human trafficking, maiming and heavy forced prostitution.
UFO calls for talks with Lufthansa
FIm Continuous dispute with the Lufthansa Group has again threatened the flight attendant union Ufo with strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the trade union will "on October 14 inform about the labor-fighting measures in the LH Group," Ufo's Tariff Board Chairman Daniel Flohr said on Friday. Lufthansa and its subsidiary Eurowings have been questioning for months about whether Ufo has negotiated tariffs with the airline.
In this point, Ufo now sees itself strengthened after a decision of the Frankfurt Labour Court. Lufthansa wanted to establish that the collective agreements were not terminated. The court rejected the applications. The company confirmed the decision and is considering to bring legal action against it. "That a second court sees the matter completely differently," I said to Flor.
In August, Lufthansa also filed an application with the Frankfurt Regional Labour Court to have UFO’s status as a union reviewed by the court, arguing that the union had not appointed a representative board for months and was therefore unable to fulfil its role as a collective bargaining partner.
There was a fierce leadership dispute in the Spartengewerkschaft, in the course of which numerous members of the board of directors and the advisory board have resigned, including longtime union leader Nicoley Baublies.The UFO had already started a vote on strikes of cabin crew at Eurowings at the end of July due to doubts about its leadership.
Easier Entry: Saudi Arabia Announces New Visa System
Until now, Saudi Arabia was not exactly known as an international tourist magnet, but that should change now. The country in the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa regulations.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract more international tourists in the future. By 2030, it wants to increase the number of international and domestic visitors to 100 million per year, the Tourism Commission said.
“Saudi Arabia’s opening up to international tourists is a historic moment for our country,” said Ahmad Al-Chatib, chairman of the Tourism Commission.
Saudi Arabia is so far difficult to access for tourists. Visas are usually granted only for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with relatives in the desert state. With the new rules, the orzconservative Kingdom hopes to reduce more revenue from the tourism business. According to his own statements, Riad wants to
In mid-September, several rockets and drones had hit two of the most important oil plants in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country's largest oil refinery in Abkhazia and the Churais oil field. As a result, national oil production collapsed dramatically, fuel price shots up. It is expected to last several weeks until its old Niau oil production resumes.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are preparing for their wedding
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding party. The model posted on Thursday (local time) in their Instagram stories several party photos, on which she can be seen in the white wedding look. Reality star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had organized a bachelorette party, according to People magazine.
Justin posted several colorful, banana-printed suits on Instagram and asked his followers: "Help me choose my tuxedo for the wedding." According to media reports, the celebrity couple wants to get married ecclesiastically next weekend.
The Biebers gave themselves the yes word in a New York State office a year ago, and there had not been a bigger party at the time.
In an interview with Australian Vogue, Hailey recently stated that the two had found a common ground after initial problems: “If you don’t want to compromise, you can’t have a relationship.”
Two killed in plane crash in Czech Republic
Two people were killed in the crash of a small plane in the western Czech Republic. The wreck was discovered on Friday in a forest area near the city of Mecin (Metschin), police said. The dead were a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities had been searching for the machine since Thursday evening after the crew had given an emergency signal via GPS. During the search, a military helicopter was also in use. The cause of the accident still needs to be determined. The crash site is located about 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometers north-east of Regenöstlich.
Half of European tree species are threatened with extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, alien species, unsustainable woodpeckers and the growth of cities are causes of the threat, the World Conservation Union IUCN already reported on Friday in Brussels. It has examined the stocks of all 454 tree species known in Europe. 265 of them are not present on the highest 2 continents of the world.
The IUCN categorizes endangered species into six categories: from "potentially endangered" to "endangered", "strongly endangered", "endangered from extinction" and "extinct in nature".
Ebony and wild horse chestnut threatened
In Germany, Ebereschen (Sorbus) are especially threatened, one of the authors, David Allen, told the German Press Agency. "Most are threatened because the populations are small anyway or because of the transformation or weakening of their habitats".
It also looks bad for the wild common horse chestnuts. They are considered "endangered" cities since 2017. All cities are considered "happy", stage two of the IUCN scale. The biggest threat represents the Balkan miner's moth next to a mushroom. It spreads from south-eastern Europe to the whole continent since the 1980s.
Straw species and moose also at risk
At the same time, the IUCN scientists created new European Red Lists for molluscs, shrubs and mosses. More than a fifth of molluscs and mosses and almost half of all shrub species are threatened, according to the IUCN. This is mainly due to the destruction of the wilderness, to the swarming of squirrels and swarmed species.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the European Bureau. "We need to limit human impacts on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority."
Earthquake in front of Istanbul: 34 people reported injured
The latest earthquake in Turkey has left 34 people injured, with no deaths reported. Dozens of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings have been damaged, with nearly 200 aftershocks since the quake the day before. The 5.8 magnitude earthquake on Thursday shook the Marmara region off Istanbul and triggered panic in the million-strong metropolis.
Now the government wants to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced. In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Under the Sea of Marmara lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian Disorder, which marks the boundary between the Eurasian and Anatolian plates.
One of the heaviest quakes was one of the strongest 7.6 quakes near Istanbul in 1999. The epicentre was then in Gölcük southeast of Istanbul. More than 17,000 people were killed.
Already on Tuesday, a quake of magnitude 4.6 had shaken the region around Istanbul, with authorities urging residents to stay away from damaged buildings.

Fight against declining spectator numbers
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and the half-time show are among the most-watched TV shows in the United States. Even if you have recently dropped spectator numbers: This February, the spectacle in the United States attracted the fewest spectators in more than ten years. Still, it was still almost one hundred million people.
In the run-up to the half-time show of the last Super Bowl, there had been riots: In the dispute over dealing with quarterback Colin Kaepernick, media reports said that top stars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not want to appear last February.
Kaepernick, then quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, did not want him to go to the NFL during the 2016/17 season before the NFL games. We don't want to see him go to his knees in protest against police violence and racism. With his protest, Kaepernick triggered a movement, numerous players took over the gesture. This caused great excitement for the football player, att Trump-Präsident
Cook-Pleite: Hotels get money from insurance
Some banks are likely to face a costly bankruptcy of travel provider Thomas Cook, according to a press report, which threatens high write-downs on outstanding bonds and loans. Credit Suisse is also affected, the Financial Times writes in its Friday issue.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or Credit Suisse would probably have to depreciate up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.8 billion (around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 billion) on their books, according to the report, according to estimates from the consulting firm AlixPartners.
Creditors of bonds would have to buy amortizations of <0xC2><0xA3>900 million to <0xC2><0xA3>1 billion and lenders would have to buy between <0xC2><0xA3>550 million and <0xC2><0xA3>825 million, and the amounts actually to be amortized would be at the top of the bands, an expert told the paper.
How great the losses of the creditors in the end will actually be, will be shown after the end of the insolvency proceedings. A person close to this procedure Thomas did not shed too much hope. For example, the about 40 planes of Thomas Cook in the UK are "old" and many of the real estate are in bad locations. More of the market could be sold out.
Rackete reportedly brought suspected murderers to Italy
Sea-watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who allegedly tortured and killed people in Libya. "We can't rule this out, but we don't even have secured information about it," said the spokesman of the refugee organization Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, the news agency dpa.
Other migrants had recognized the three men in Italy. They are accused of having raped, tortured and killed people in Libya. The alleged perpetrators were arrested in the detention camp in Italian Messina. New builders emphasized that the refugee organizations could not check who they would come to their ships "
On June 29, Carola Rackete had illegally brought migrants to the port of Lampedusa and framed a ship of the Italian financial police. On that day, the three suspects were also supposed to have arrived there. Investigations are underway against the captain for aiding illegal immigration.
U.S. Warns Federal Government of Huawei
The head of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government against trusting Chinese network equipment manufacturer Huawei.
We believe the risks are too great,” Pai told the “trade sheet” with a view to building the new 5G mobile network.
China has a “national security law” that obliges any company “under Chinese jurisdiction” to follow instructions from the security agencies.
The applicable law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests," the FCC chief continued, making it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The federal government has now agreed to require suppliers to issue a "confidence statement".
At first, Berlin wants to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the "Handelsblatt", citing its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology does not consist only of the hardware:
It is the software that is important to keep the devices up-to-date. This software is made up of billions of lines of program code that change over time," Pai said.
It is “very difficult to imagine” that a government agency, “no matter where, would be able to check every single update in real time to detect security risks,” the FCC chief continued.
He accuses the Chinese company Huawei of close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The ownership conditions are opaque. The employee company, which is allegedly owned by the company, is not necessarily independent of the government," Pai told the "trade sheet".
Pai was recently in Berlin for talks to promote the position of the United States, and he was in the process of putting forward a report to the U.S. Department of State.
Chemical plant in northern France is burning: Schools closed
At night, residents hear explosions. A giant firewall illuminates the sky above a northern French chemical factory. The fire has been extinguished after hours - but the cleaning could now take days.
After a fire at a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, schools and nurseries in the region remain closed.
In twelve municipalities, the facilities would not be opened on Friday, the competent prefecture informed. The interior ministry had asked citizens to stay as much as possible in buildings and not to expose themselves to smoke. There were no injured. Farmers and breeders were called on to protect their animals and bring them in.
The fire could be completely extinguished on Thursday night, as the prefecture announced. There is still a risk that after the extinguishing smell will spread, according to the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, at the site of the fire were 240 firefighters, as well as 90 policemen and gendarmes.
A gigantic black smoke column had previously risen from the chemical plant. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the factory of the company Lubrizol, which produces additives for oils. The production plant is located a few kilometers from the city center.
The factory in Normandy belongs to the so-called Seveso category of hazardous sites, which are particularly monitored. In 1976, in the Italian Seveso near Milan, there was a devastating chemical accident.
The prefect of the Normandy region, Pierre-André Durand, told news channel BFMTV that at first no "high toxicity" was detected in samples. However, a pollution of the nearby Seine could not be ruled out. In the river dams were built against the pollution, the prefecture explained.
The fire broke out in the early morning at around 02.40 hours, authorities reported. The cause remained unclear at first. Rouen is a regional metropolis and is located on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Finance Minister: “Germany needs to invest now”
The French Minister of Economy and Finance Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to make greater investments to boost economic growth in the eurozone.
Germany needs to invest now, the sooner the better," Le Maire said Thursday at the presentation of the French budget for the coming year.
The economy in the eurozone is weakening, the minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation worsens to make the necessary decisions."
Action should be taken by those states that have budget space for more investment, Le Maire said, among other things, with a view to Germany.
France does not have these gaps, the minister added, referring to the high national debt of his country. This is more than 98 percent of the gross domestic product. The French national debt must be "stabilized" and "reduced", said Le Maire.
In recent years, calls have repeatedly come from France to Germany to make more public investment to revive the European economy. In return, German politicians have repeatedly urged France to get its budget deficit under control.
The French budget for 2020, presented on Thursday, foresees tax relief of more than nine billion euros for households.
Among other things, the French government is responding to the protests of the yellow vest movement, with the new debt expected to fall to 2.2 percent, after expected 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson avoids question on Brexit tactics
British Prime Minister Johnson has sharply criticized the "capitulation law" passed by parliament.
Parliament is back, a law requires the British prime minister to avoid a chaos Brexit. However, critics fear that Boris Johnson could still use a slippery slope. Addressed to this possibility, however, the Tory politician shuns.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is keeping himself covered up about whether he wants to enforce an unregulated Brexit – despite the latest law passed by parliament, which is exactly what is meant to prevent it.
The law requires the government to request a postponement of the withdrawal date, should no agreement with the EU be reached by mid-October, Johnson criticizes this as a "capitulation law" that complicates negotiations with the EU.
Former British Prime Minister John Major had expressed on Thursday the assumption that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. The prime minister could use a procedural trick that postpones the entry into force of the law until the time after the EU exit. Johnson said he is aiming for a deal with the European Union that is likely to be signed on October 31.
Johnson's chief adviser Dominic Cummings, meanwhile, said he felt the political disputes over Brexit were "walking in the park" and was confident that the sought-after EU exit would still come about: "We enjoy this, we will win, we will leave (Note d.
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign "Vote Leave" during the campaign ahead of the 2016 EU referendum, is now serving as a chief strategist at the British government's Downing Street seat, behind the uncompromising policy that has led the prime minister to a near-impossible situation.
The Polaroid Diaries by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of the camera of Linda McCartney, who has become one of the very great rock photographers. But it does not always have to be the great glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (bags) dives deep into the very private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her from 1969 until Linda's death in 1998, was visibly proud and moved when he presented the picture tape "The Polaroid Diaries" in mid-September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.
Following the launch event, McCartney wrote on Instagram: “#ThePolaroidDiaries is a fleeting look at the life of an extraordinary family from the time before Instagram, a celebration of LindaMcCartney’s legacy as a committed artist and the instant magic of the Polaroid film.”
Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found photography, was always there with the camera. Thousands of Polaroids have made it, a few hundred of them are now published for the first time in "The Polaroid Diaries".
They are portraits, still lifes, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. "She wanted real moments", writes the art critic Ekow Eshun in his foreword. And of course there is always one in the center: your husband Paul - as you may have never seen him before.
There he dances with his daughter Mary on the shoulders, telephones in the bathrobe with a bag on his head or wears non-shaped moon boots. Sure, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but beyond the headlights on their farm in southern England or in Scotland, it had also led a very normal life of McCart, so she said in Mary McCartney
Like hardly any other medium, the Polaraid camera captures the immediate moment. Linda McCartney’s recordings are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than just snapshots.
It's about the decisive click: you have to recognize when a great photo happens in front of you. And then you have to snap it at exactly the right moment," said Paul McCartney. "If you snap two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo." And Linda would have had the gift of always having the right moment to capture it.
Here, the light, the composition, the picture cutout and the colors are right, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but also anecdotal is also a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes seem like abstract paintings of 50 years.
“We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran.”
Turkey wants to continue importing oil and gas from neighboring countries despite US sanctions against Iran, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not stop oil and gas imports from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there," Erdogan said in New York, where he attended the UN General Assembly.
Erdogan, however, admitted that Turkey had problems importing Iranian oil, as some companies had withdrawn “due to U.S. threats.”
Nevertheless, Turkey “will continue our relations with Iran, especially in this matter and in many other matters,” said the Turkish president, who had repeatedly criticized US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The United States has pursued a policy of "maximum pressure" on the Islamic Republic since its withdrawal from the international nuclear agreement with Iran. According to the United States, Iran secretly pursues a nuclear program and does not adhere to the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iranian oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran, and tensions in the Gulf region have increased significantly in recent months.
U.S. government wants to restrict the reception of refugees
The U.S. government wants to drastically restrict the reception of refugees. The U.S. Department of State said on Thursday that the annual ceiling for a resettlement program is to be lowered from 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, which is equivalent to a cut of 40 percent.
The U.S. Department of State stated that while the United States would continue to be committed to supporting refugees, the most important task is to protect and serve U.S. citizens. Currently, the U.S. immigration system is overloaded.
The U.S. government wants to focus on the admission of two groups of refugees in the future: people persecuted because of their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are thus in danger, as the Foreign Ministry's statement indicates.
The program, launched in 1980, narrowly selects refugees from UN camps around the world and resettles them in the United States. The upper limit of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the program's history. Already the current upper limit of 30,000 is a low. As the predecessor of US President Barack Obama, 85,000 is a low.
"This is a very sad day for America," said the head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband, who said the United States would further damage its leadership role in protecting the world's most vulnerable.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration to the United States - legal and illegal. The U.S. government expects 350,000 asylum applications for the coming budget year. These numbers are separate from the resettlement program.
Donald Trump - "Close to a spittle"
U.S. President Donald Trump has accused whistleblowers in the whistleblower affair of espionage. Whoever has insulted the whistleblower who accuses him of abuse of power, "comes close to a splash," Trump said, according to a recording of a private event Thursday in New York.
According to Trump, speaking before U.S. mission officials, when asked about the person who briefed the whistleblower about controversial events in the White House, he replied, “That’s coming close to a splash.” Then Trump added, “Do you know what we did differently now in the old days when we were going to be smart, and that’s right.
Observers last commented on a possible reference to the death penalty. Democrats sharply criticized Trump's statements and accused him of intimidation by witnesses. It was also an attempt to impede a congressional investigation into a possible impeachment proceedings against him and impeaching the ex-offenders.
The whistleblower accuses the president in a now published complaint of having abused his office in order to request a interference of another country in the US elections 2020. Specifically, it is about his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Joodymyr Selenskyj possible to put the Democrats to him in a conversation against Trump in the summer.
It is still unclear who both the whistleblower and his informant are, but as the New York Times reports, the whistleblower is said to be an analyst with the foreign intelligence service CIA.
Refugee boat stranded: baby and toddler drown in Aegean
Time and again, people are trying to get from Turkey to Greece across the Aegean Sea. Often the boats are too small. Seven migrants have now been killed in the sinking of a hose boat - including five children.
Four children, three women and five men were rescued from the floods by the crew of a passing ferry near the Greek island of Chios, where seven migrants were killed in the sinking of a hose boat.
Among the victims is also a locksmith, reported the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants had broken up from Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small archipelago of Inousses in the northeast of the island of Chios. Inousses is located between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean Sea, mostly in much too small boats, have been killed on this route last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) 174 people.
The Who Break Concert
A US concert by the rock band The Who has found a nasty ending due to an inappropriateness of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of his performance on Wednesday night (local time) in Houston, his voice failed the service. On the eighth song, Daltrey told the audience: "I think I should leave it as long as it continues".
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend apologised and added that Daltrey could "no longer really talk". Townsend promised the audience to come to his expense at a reparation concert, but a date has not yet been set.
The Who, scheduled for Friday in Dallas and Sunday in Denver, canceled appearances to be picked up at a later date. 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old bandmate Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Renting suddenly stopped: WeWork makes real estate markets shake
In New York, WeWork has become the largest office space company.
Within a few years, WeWork will rise from a small startup to a driving force in the world’s most expensive real estate markets. But now the company is in crisis. Landlords have to fear billions in revenue.
The crisis of the office tenant WeWork major threatens to disrupt the balance on the largest real estate markets in the world. The company had dropped Adam Neumann as head a few days ago, postponed the planned IPO and with the sale of subsidiaries and values such as the private jet for the executives has begun to "bring to the british of the month to the new York.
WeWork is now renting large office space in the long term and renting them out in short-term, partly small units to members. This can be individual freelancers, small startups or entire departments of large corporations. So far, WeWork is expected to burn money with this business at breathtaking speed. In the past year, the company went from one million dollars to one million dollars.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now concluded leases with terms of up to 15 years, resulting in commitments of more than $40 billion. These huge liabilities could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for entire real estate markets.
According to calculations by the economist Dan Alpert of the Cornell Law School in New York, the location of the WeWork in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, has increased in the past 24 months to almost 300,000 square meters of office space. WeWork's new contracts alone made it possible for the demand for offices in New York to increase in this time.
Even in the UK capital, the balance in the real estate market could shift noticeably without a further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant, in a office house bought last year by savings bank fund provider Deka for almost 100 million euros in the center of the financial metropolis.
Many landlords have converted their properties to the requirements of WeWork only with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the owners of real estate would have to write off a part of the expected billions of revenues. Access to the - anyway scarce - reserves of WeWork they do not have the long-term.
Russia Detains Numerous North Korean Fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard has again taken action against North Korean fishermen, with a total of 262 other poachers arrested in recent days who had illegally fished in the waters, the Russian FSB told Interfax news agency on Friday.
Only ten days ago, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. Previously, the border guards had been shot and three of them were injured. This time there were no injuries. Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages.
According to the North Korean fishermen were travelling in Russian territorial waters in 2018. There, the coast guard of Russia, according to their own information, patrols to protect their marine biological resources. During the re-inspections, 30,000 inkjets were detected. In addition, the information was confiscated in three fishing boats and two motor boats.
The Russian fishing authority did not issue fishing licenses to North Koreans this year, even after complaints from local entrepreneurs. According to media reports, thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been temporarily arrested there in 2019.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the far-eastern region of Primorye, Georgi Martynov, also complained about the recent high ecological damage by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with prohibited in Russia narrow mesh synthetic nets. Also, with these, they would not take care of the small living creatures from the sea. Also, they would take care of the 200-year-olds from the sea.
Three members of the Russian Coast Guard were injured in the previous week's arrests, according to Moscow. According to the FSB, a North Korean also wounded later died of his injuries. On September 17, Russian border guards first arrested a North Korean boat and then a second one, after the Fed destroyed it.
U.S. bans entry to ex-President Castro
The US has imposed entry bans on former Cuban President Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Castro and his children. The US Department of State justified this in a statement Thursday with Castro's involvement in "gross human rights violations". As the head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean state, he would face a system in which he wants to capture more than 100 Cubans.
As the chairman of the armed forces, the brother of the late leader of the revolution, Fidel Castro, also acquiesced in human rights violations there, through the support of the President of Venezuela, Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s Maduro. "The disregard for human rights and the use of force by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regimes" are based on the words of the Venezuelan president,
President Donald Trump on Wednesday issued entry bans against Venezuelan government and military officials, among others. In Venezuela, a bitter power struggle between the government and the opposition has been raging for months. The US has imposed a whole series of sanctions against Maduro's government to force him to kneel and intercede for himself.
Cuba is considered one of Maduro's closest allies. The socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of doctors sent. According to the United States and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous intelligence agents to Venezuela to help the government suppress government opponents.
New Climate Protests from Fridays for Future
A week after the biggest international climate protests to date, thousands of people want to take to the streets again today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement is planning again actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world. It is expected to begin due to the time lag between New Zealand and Australia, before the protests spread across Europe to North America. There, climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to take part in a large-scale demonstration in De kanad.
How big the worldwide outcry will be on this Friday after the record participation of the previous week is relatively unclear. Thunberg himself was good things. "Last Friday more than four million people went on strike for the climate. This Friday we do it again!", she wrote on Twitter. So far, as part of the strike week, he has given 6383 actions in 170 countries.
In particular in Germany, the influx last Friday was very large. A good third of all global demonstrators - around 1.4 million - had participated in the protests in 575 German cities. This time, according to a list of the movement, the protests were also planned in small demonstrations in at least 65 cities, including in Berlin and in Metropolen.
At the age of 15, Thunberg sat before the Swedish Parliament in August 2018 to call on the politicians of their country to make a stronger commitment to climate protection. This resulted in the Fridays-for-future movement within a short time. The climate protests are mainly attended by other students and scientists, but also by increasing numbers of students.
Together, they demand more ambition from politics in the fight against global warming and the looming climate catastrophe. Above all, according to the Paris Climate Agreement, global warming must be curbed to below 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial times.
Thunberg had arrived in New York just a month after a two-week transatlantic session with a high-seas race hunt, Right Livebel. There she had recently participated in climate protests and United Nations summits. On Monday, she gave an emotional speech at the UN, in which she spoke to the Heads of State and Government of the United Nations on behalf of climate protection.
Russia bans smoking on the balcony
People in Russia are no longer allowed to smoke on the balcony in the future. This envisages a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," a spokesman for the emergency ministry told the agency Tass on Thursday in Moscow. The ban is expected to take effect on October 1.
Anyone who smokes, however, must expect a fine of 3,000 rubles (42.46 euros). If the cigarette should ignite a fire, then the penalty will be higher. Under the ban, the Ministry says, also burning candles. Also grilling meatballs on the balcony is no longer allowed.
Strike against cybercriminals - Investigators suspend servers
In the fight against crimes on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time singled out a large server provider for illegal transactions in the darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of having hosted numerous websites as operators of a data center in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach on the Moselle, through which internationally-acting criminals operated their machinations.
Seven suspects were arrested in a major action on Thursday night. The darknet is a shielded part of the Internet. The darknet is a part of the Internet.
Customers of the suspects are said to have been, among other things, the operators of the world's second-largest darknet drug marketplace, "Wall Street Market", which investigators had cracked down on in the spring. The attack on 1.25 million telecom routers at the end of November 2016 was also carried out via a server in the Cybersteuerbunker, according to the Attorney General's Office.
A webhoster provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence, the first time such a host has been excavated in Germany.
The access action, supported by special units such as the GSG9, has been the result of searches in Germany and neighbouring countries, the result of almost five years of investigations. At noon the investigators want to inform about further details.
New Global Climate Protests by Fridays for Future
A week after the biggest international climate protests to date, thousands of people want to take to the streets again today for more climate protection.
To conclude an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement once again planned actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Juchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt.
Climate protests <0xC7><0x80> Who are Thunberg’s backers?
The sense of justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that heat the climate. All the more surprising that a 16-year-old girl keeps a mirror in front of the people of power of this time. But what is behind it? Is it his willingness to help or smart marketing?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses in motion and leads young people to rise up to a better climate-friendly world. It is historically not the first time in Europe that a young person manages to win an accumulation of children and adolescents. As early as 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne was able to choose a place for himself in America.
But there is a shadowy side in this regard? After all, why does it need a stock called "We don't have time" to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has a rich PR manager by her side. By the way, her mother also published a book that has sold far and wide, thanks to the one who was a follower of the road to the world.
Here the spirits are now separating: Is it morally right to enrich themselves financially in saving the world? Is it still authentic when certain groups of people work together with stockbrokers during the world rescue action? No matter what position is ultimately taken, a critical and reflective point of view can be made more and more important in a democratically shaped society.
Comet Discovered: Interstellar Guest Crosses Our Solar System
An alien comet is currently traversing our solar system.
The astronomers’ conjectures have been confirmed: A strange comet is currently traversing our solar system – it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - Researchers have long suspected this, but now they have certainty: A comet from another star is currently traversing our solar system. It was named after its discoverer 2I/Borisov and currently employs astronomers worldwide.
2I/Borisov: Comet discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissov in the Crimea. He looked at the sky with a self-built telescope and further observations confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet that does not originate from our solar system. He was only the second species to be discovered during his flight.
The great opportunity for astronomers now is to get a closer look at an alien solar system. Apparently, the comet is similar to our own system, as reported by the Astrophysical Institute of the Canaries. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), the comet is clearly moving out of our interstellar origin and is thus moving out of our current system.
Comet was already seen before arrival - and can be observed for several months
But before it is so far, astronomers can still observe it in depth. Because unlike its predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in its approach, which means that it can be studied for many months from Earth. "The object will be able to see the greatest brightness in mid-December, and then only by April 2020 will be able to see it with medium-sized telescopic
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First findings about Comet 2I/Borisov raise hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be 2 to 16 kilometers in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body seems to be similar to our comets - because as IAC researcher Julia de Le<0xC3><0xB3>n puts it, the spectrum of the Milky Way star is similar to ours. This observation could suggest that comets are similar to ours in other solar systems.
The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within just two years may allow a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
Asteroids are constantly occupied by the researchers. Only recently, a giant asteroid rushed past the Earth and came dangerously close to it.
"Absolutely disgusting": Rachel Johnson shocked by brother
Boris Johnson becomes more lonely. First his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister, in clear words, scolds the Prime Minister's warlike language as "tasteless". It's not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation", "fraud", contract": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and is constantly gearing up - at least verbally. At the question hour in the lower house on Wednesday, this met with massive outrage from the opposition, and in the meantime, more critics have spoken out: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told Sky News that her brother used words such as capitulation, as if opponents of an EU exit should be "hanged, dragged, quadruped, tarnished, and feathered". She considers this to be highly reprehensible. She did not recognize her brother's version of the EU-appointed for the anti-Bashing, Rachel Johnson's said.
In particular, she ran into the fact that her brother, Jo Cox, was referring to a more straight-lined, EU-friendly member of parliament, who had been murdered by a neo-Nazi a few days before the 2016 exit referendum. His memory could best be honoured by going through Brexit, Boris Johnson had said in the House of Commons, "It's all too plain.
Cox's widower also criticized the prime minister sharply. "It makes me sick when Jo's name is used in this way," he tweeted. The best way to honor her is if you are passionate and determined to enter into what you believe in - no matter what opinion you are. But you should never complain to him that he is "the other side of you".
Only a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson’s younger brother Jo laid down his position as Secretary of State and his mandate as Tory MP. “I’ve been torn between loyalty to the family and national interest in recent months – it’s an indissoluble tension,” Jo Johnson said.
Johnson's language also encountered sharp criticism in the church. As the "Times" reports, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language that "this country is not worthy." In a joint statement, they declared to each other: "In recent days, the language should not be accepted, both in debates with Parliament and outside.
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez perform at the Super Bowl
In the year of its 100th anniversary, the NFL is a strong sign: in the upcoming Super Bowl half-time show, two women with Latino roots appear, who promise "an explosion of fun and energy".
Latina power at the Super Bowl: Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the half-time show at the upcoming U.S. Football League NFL final, the organizers announced on Thursday (local time).
"I feel incredibly honored and humbled to represent the Latino community alongside JLo, because it has an incredible strength in the United States," Shakira said in a video.
The final of the American Football League, which celebrates its 100th birthday next year, will be held on February 2 in Miami. In the metropolis at the southern tip of Florida, many people with Latin American roots live. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is of Puerto Rican origin.
"I love that this time the Super Bowl puts two women on the stage - and two Latinas," Lopez explained. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises for the show "an explosion of fun and energy".
The 50-year-old was born in New York City after her parents had emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s, she landed big hits with songs such as "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" and later also released songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and is from November in the drama "Hustler".
Shakira became known in Colombia as the star of a telenovela and singer. She made her worldwide breakthrough in 2001 with her first bilingual album and the single "Whenever, Wherever".
The announcement of the half-time guests is expected with excitement in the US every time. This year, many also value the selection as a political gesture. After all, the country, not least due to the immigration policy of President Donald Trump, is deeply divided.
The Super Bowl is the largest US sporting event and at the same time a gigantic advertising spectacle. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones caused furore there. As a rule, at the NFL final, far more than 100 million TV viewers are in love with it, it is also in Germany.
Last year, there were political controversies in advance. The reason for the dispute was 5 quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to rise to the national anthem in protest against police violence against blacks and was criticized for this, among other things, by U.S. President Donald Trump.
An actor and YouTuber joins Egypt’s ruler: For now, however, Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad.
The two men, who have been influencing on whether the streets of Egypt have been tainted with blood, have been tainted in the past week, have been tainted both in foreign countries. One of the two swelled again at Cairo airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly in New York. The former general, who had been tainted by the Moslems in 2013
In the opinion of the president of the other man, which currently determines what is happening on the streets, he tries to mislead Aliben. Mohamed Ali is, of course, staying abroad, where he escapes the access of the security forces, who would immediately arrest him if he tried to enter Egyptian soil, he is known to the people of the country. Only weeks ago, he was the 45-year-old
He addresses the head of state directly and in quite rustic language. While the people are hungry, the president is swallowed up in luxury and lets himself build magnificent new palaces, it is said there. The army leadership, on which Sisi bases his rule, is showing Ali corruption and enrichment. Because he is aware of the fact that in his second profession as a construction contractor, he is very much involved in this business for 15 years.
Protezis has been protesting for the first time since Sisis <0xCC><0x81>s arrest. Protezis has been protesting against his rule for the first time since Sisis <0xCC><0x81>s arrest. Protezis has been protesting for the first time since Sisis <0xCC><0x81>s arrest. Protezis <0xCC><0x81>s arrest has been protesting thousands of people against his rule and almost 2000 citizens, among them prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, Ali called for this Friday called for a "Million march".
From the city of Mansura in the Nile Delta, where protesters wanted to rip off a banner with the portrait of the president in pieces last week, a riot was reported on Friday. Security forces erected checkpoints in the city and on the outskirts of the city. In Cairo, several metro stations in the heart of the city were surrounded by the "maintenance of the street".
Mohamed Ali prompted these provisions to change his tactics: "Our goal must not be the Tahrir Square," Ali said in Barcelona in his video camera. "Let's not collide with police officers." As a retreater, however, this is not to be understood: "All of Egypt is the Tahrir Square".
If the provider promises too much performance
Although the Internet connection seems to be always much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various testing options.
If you enter into an Internet contract, you do not have to blindly trust the speed data of the providers. Customers can check for themselves how much of it is actually achieved in the event of emergencies.
After all, the previously promised transfer rates are part of the contract and should therefore also be achieved, explains the Bavarian Consumer Centre.
If the connection seems to be always much slower than advertised by the provider, there are different test options. For example, the measuring tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
"The tests of the suppliers are carried out according to supplier-specific specifications and are therefore not uniform and objectively calculated," says the consumer centre Bavaria on its website.
If the connection is significantly slower than announced, customers can set the provider a reasonable period of usually 14 days to produce the promised service. Affected persons do this best in writing by e-mail.
If this does not work even after multiple requests, customers can cancel and may also claim compensation for damages. However, in the event of no success, only the lawsuit will help.
First-Range Republican to Investigate
"I think the investigation is important, yes, and where this leads from here, is determined by the facts that can be ascertained by the president," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday, referring to the impeachment inquiry against U.S. President Donald Trump.
Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump repeatedly urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj in a phone call to investigate interventions by Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine, because Trump has been watching Biden “for years.”
Republicans have so far withheld criticism of Trump over the whistleblower affair; few have expressed discomfort about it. Scott’s remarks are a first sign of this in Trump’s party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already repeatedly spoken out against Trump’s policies, for example against loosening environmental protection regulations and embargoes.
Spider-Man Remains in the MCU: Another Marvel Movie
It was a shock to all Spider-Man fans: At the end of August, it was announced that Sony and Marvel would go their separate ways in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would no longer be part of the "Avengers" universe. It was completely unclear how the films about Tom Holland would continue.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man receives after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home" another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). This is reported by several U.S. media in agreement. According to this, the film is scheduled to start in the United States from July 16, 2021.
In "Screenrant" magazine, Marvel-boos Kevin Feige is quoted as saying, "I'm glad that Spidey's way is being continued in the MCU. I and everyone at the Marvel studios are delighted that we can continue to work on it ... He's the only superhero with the ability to play along in different universes, as Sony will never continue to work on his
But how does the sudden good news come about? Sony Marvel reportedly submitted an offer. According to industry magazines, the Disney Group, which also belongs to Marvel, would participate with 30 percent in the revenues of upcoming Spider-Man films. However, the news is not confirmed.
Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the "Suits" final
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" has now reached the grand finale in the USA. In the last episode there were many happy endings and as many cameo appearances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who participated for many years in the series, was included in the series in a charming way Tribute Tribute to the following Tribute Azolle
One thing in advance: Duchess Meghan did not return in the finale for a final farewell as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some retrospectives once again showed the most memorable scenes with today's Duchess. For example, the moments of the failed and of his happy marriage with Mike or she likes to leave after his happy marriage with Mike or
But also her real husband, Prince Harry, was not mentioned at random in the "Suits" finale of England, but at least in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) steps straight towards the altar to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), the Prince's wife, Harvey's wife, only makes a very good deal of Anmerk.
Aegean: Baby and four other children drown in boat accident
A baby and four other children drowned in the sinking of a refugee boat in the Aegean Sea. A total of seven people died in the accident, the Greek Coast Guard said on Friday. The nationalities are still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inoussus, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men were rescued.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey are currently crossing to the Greek islands in the eastern Aegean Sea. According to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), 174 people were killed on this route last year. Federal Minister Horst Seehofer has now announced that he wants to visit both countries.
Together with his French counterpart and the responsible EU Commissioner, he wants to "inform Turkey about the refugee situation," said Seehofer on Friday, and then in Athens he wants to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in order to help cope.
A spokeswoman for the European Commission confirmed Seehofer’s planned trip on Friday with EU Home Affairs Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France’s Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
In Greece, an unusually large number of migrants continue to arrive from Turkey, with 654 people moving to the Greek islands on Tuesday alone, the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection said on Wednesday.
Is the Turkey deal still working?
The increased numbers recently raised doubts about the functioning of the 2016 EU-Turkey agreement. This provides that the EU can send back all refugees and migrants who illegally come over Turkey to the Greek islands. In return, the EU wanted to send one Syrian refugee for every deported Syrian.
On the Greek side, however, the processing of asylum applications is only arduous due to a lack of staff. According to the Ministry of Civil Protection, almost 29,400 people are living in Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos. The worst is the situation on Lesbos: 5,200 migrants are currently housed in a camp with a capacity of 650 people.
Never since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey refugee pact in March 2016 have there been so many, the state broadcaster reported.
Climate Change: Heat Leads to More Heart Attacks
According to doctors, climate change will put the health system to the test in the future. The diabetics are "very sure" that climate change is one of the biggest challenges for the health system in the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, President of the German Society of Cardiology. In particular, the cardiovascular system caused high temperatures and high temperature jumps in time.
Green politician must be held accountable for embarrassing photoshoot
The head of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election campaign - was the cup manipulated for this reason?
The Canadian green boss holds a reusable cup in her hand in a photo, but now it came out: the cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It has been quite a long time unnoticed - and finally can be noticed as well. The reusable coffee mug with metal straw has already been reused. Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Greens, never held it in her hand. On the party's website she was seen in a photo with this mug and in conversation with the citizens.
Green boss must be held accountable for photo failure
The National Post then accused May of manipulation and of the fact that the party is producing fake news in order to appear more credible on the topic of "environmental protection", and this in the middle of an election campaign for the lower house election, in which it is also increasingly difficult for Trudeau due to a bribery scandal.
The photo went viral on social media and started the discussion about Fake News. One user shares a cross-reference of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their chairs to hide their disposable cup".
May was shocked and remarked on her blog that she knew nothing about this action. To underline this, she posted the original: she, in conversation with citizens, a cup in her hand. However, she put it right, it was made of bamboo. She always saw it. A spokeswoman of the party told the picture that it was not there.
"I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she says to the Guardian, and at the same time asks something from her over-committed team: "If they want to edit a picture again, can't they do something with my face like that?"
The German greens have also come to Shitstorms because of their use of disposable plastic or because of air travel - but their pictures were not photographed. For example, the head of the Bavarian greens, Katharina Schulze, ate ice cream with plastic spoons on holiday, as merkur.de* reported.
Influencer wants free upgrade: Lifelong flight ban at Cathay
Jaqueline Ng was reportedly granted an upgrade by email from Cathay Pacific, but when she asked for it at check-in, she was not allowed on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Spontaneously getting an upgrade for the Business Class - many passengers dream of it. Sometimes they are lucky, and the staff at the check-in offer a change from the Economy Class for free.
However, this case shows how not to do it: A self-proclaimed influencer has actively asked the airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. On Instagram, Jaqueline Ng is followed by more than 65,000 users. On May 30, she flew back from Taiwan to New York and on June 7.
On the outbound flight, Jaqueline’s employees refused an upgrade despite the fact that she presented an email in which Cathay Pacific allegedly offered an upgrade. The letter seeks to have the influencer received from an airline marketing employee. The airline, on the other hand, accuses Jaqueline of forging the mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline again tried to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight. This time the woman allegedly presented the same mail, but with a different reference number. The employees at JFK airport were skeptical: they hacked at the headquarters. And in fact, the employee, from whom the mail was supposed to originate, did not have the mail system.
Airline employees at the airport canceled Jaqueline’s ticket and imposed a life-long flight ban on Cathay Pacific, for $1,400 (around $1,280) she had to buy a new flight ticket to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company that represents consumer interests, because Cathay had reimbursed her the price for her original ticket, but Jaqueline also demanded the cost of the new ticket back.
However, as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: For Cathay, the influencer has committed fraud, she remains blocked for future flights. The airline's terms and conditions also state that she does not have to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to settle for it - and now hires a lawyer.
Oil prices drop after report on ceasefire in Yemen
On Friday afternoon, oil prices fell by more than one dollar in the shortest possible time. Recently, a barrel (159 liters) of the North Sea variety Brent cost $ 61.83 - about 1.4 percent less than the day before. The price for a barrel of the American variety West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to $ 55.77.
The move was triggered by a Wall Street Journal report on a ceasefire in Yemen, with Saudi Arabia reportedly agreeing to a ceasefire in four areas.
A drone attack on the oil facilities in Saudi Arabia in mid-September had brought down five percent of the world's oil production. The Houthi rebels allied with Iran in the civil war country of Yemen had advertised the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia, like the US government, would blame Iran for the ceasefire. A regional police force would be responsible for the ceasefire.
If an agreement is actually reached, one could focus on growth and demand concerns, said Ole Hansen, head of the raw material strategy department at Saxo Bank, Bloomberg news agency.
Oil prices continue their downward movement of the past few days. A week ago, a barrel of WTI oil had cost up to almost 59 dollars, Brent almost 65 dollars.
According to Bloomberg, repairs to oil facilities in Saudi Arabia are progressing faster than expected after the attack in mid-September, with production reaching 8 million barrels per day and moving back towards the original volume.
Recently, there have been multiple press releases citing insiders who report on the rapid progress of state-owned oil group Saudi Aramco in repair work, but raw material experts have pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning a stock market and wants to avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, there was some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after the arrest by Iran and the recently granted release on the way to leave the port. The crew is now preparing the departure with Refun, while the ship is still waiting for the day of departure in the morning.
However, the U.S. has announced plans to move missiles and soldiers to Saudi Arabia as Iran’s arch-enemy, and fears of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the U.S. and Britain have temporarily pushed oil prices significantly up in recent weeks.
Accusations against Trump intensify
In the affair about possible abuse of power by U.S. President Donald Trump, accusations of cover-up against the White House have become loud. Several leading government officials have made an intense effort, after a controversial phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj explained to the speaker the access to the wording of the speech.
North Korea calls third summit of Trump and Kim questionable
North Korea has raised doubts that it will soon come to a third summit in the nuclear dispute between Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump. The meaning and the prospects of such a meeting are questionable due to the lack of progress in the implementation of the agreements of the first summit in Singapore, Kim said at the summit.
The U.S. has done nothing to implement the summit's decisions so far last year, the adviser to North Korea's foreign ministry said, criticizing tightened U.S. sanctions and joint military maneuvers by the U.S. and South Korea, but hoping for a "wise" and "brave" decision by Trump to come back to an agreement with the U.S.
Trump said on Monday that he would like to know what a third summit with Kim would bring, but before he prepares to do so, the negotiations on a disarmament of the North Korean nuclear and missile program have been going on since the failed second summit of Trump and Kim in Hanoi, the two of them fell into disrepute.
Prince Harry: Weapons manufacturers to help with mine clearance
The British Prince Harry in Angola symbolically detonated and destroyed a mine of explosives. But on the way to a camp of the British Halo Trust near the town of Dirico, he set up the ignition circuit. At a safe distance, the explosives exploded. With the aim of getting rid of the mines of the Angolans by 2025, he was able to get rid of all the mines
Pounds under pressure - interest rate cut expected
British pound under pressure
In the face of a soon-to-be rate cut, the pound is losing value against the euro.
Speculation about the Bank of England’s (BoE) interest rate cut soon adds to the pound sterling, with the British currency falling by up to 0.4 percent to $1.2269 on Friday.
The sales were triggered by statements by the central banker Michael Saunders. This brought a reduction in interest rates into the conversation, even if a chaotic Brexit could be averted, as the uncertainty will affect the British economy for the foreseeable future. This statement was surprising, as Saunders said Analtrachte as a monetary critic.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burden on the economy due to the Brexit hack without directly signaling an interest rate cut. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to lead his country out of the EU even without a divorce agreement on October 31.
More: With his provocations, the British Prime Minister has taken a high risk, but it could pay off for him, says Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: More Russian Manipulations Proven
Material from the Moscow Analytical Laboratory is being manipulated - this is confirmed by David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and today's head of integrity of the World Athletics Association.
At the start of the World Championships in Athletics, new details about the doping scandal in Russia appear - and they destroy the little credibility that the Russian sport had regained at the beginning of the year and even only initially. In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Laboratory finally delivered the required tests to the world.
In December 2014, a systematic fraud in the Russian sport was revealed. In addition, in the summer of 2018, the Wada had blocked the Russian anti-doping agency (Rusada) in the World Cup for three years. During this time, Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. The International Olympic Committee left Russia after an individual examination at the 2016 Summer Games.
There are no positive findings
The following September, the Wada lifted the Rusada banner again, but requested access to the laboratory and the said samples. The data should provide information on the extent of concealment of doping cases in state doping. They should help to punish athletes subsequently. Three months later, they were concluded.
The chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the Athletics World Association (IAAF) has been positive. They have now confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow analytical laboratory has been manipulated. "Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the task force has received the correct data from the World Athletics Association (IAAF).
The World Cup is not affected
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: the Athletics Association is the only organization to hold on to the ban of Russia. At the World Cup in Doha, 30 Russian athletes start under neutral flag. They had to prove that they are training outside the Russian system and undergo tests.
Earlier this week, the Wada had already placed manipulations in the room and asked Russia to respond to the accusations within three weeks. Russia is now threatening to block the Rusada again and, in the worst case, to exclude the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
