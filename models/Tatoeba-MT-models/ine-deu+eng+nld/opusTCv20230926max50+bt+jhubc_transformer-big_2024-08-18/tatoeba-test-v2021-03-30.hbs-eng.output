Man has many desires that he does not even want to be fulfilled and it would even be wrong to assume the opposite. He wants them to remain only desires, they have value only in his imagination; their fulfillment would be a bitter disappointment for him. One of such desires would be the desire for a more painful life, the desire for eternal life would be fulfilled.

We can't go back.
I'll take a shower.

Do you have any questions?
I know him well.
Can anything be more romantic?

It's time for the truth.
It's none of our business.

Why are you asking?
I saw Markus' house.

I counted up to 200.
I tried to convince Tom to come home.
One day you should try it.
I'm staying home with Grandma and Grandpa for the weekend.
What did you conclude?
I prayed for you.
No, that's all.
Come to my house.
Tom's on the edge of the nerve.
The bathroom is upstairs.
Tomorrow is Christmas.
Why are you doing this to yourself?

I'll finish reading this book.
Who are you really?
We all cried a lot.
Did you wash the dishes?
I'll tell you the truth now.
Do I usually look happy?
It's not the essay itself, but all these deadly questions and explanations of words drive me crazy!
It's the weekend.
I'll be back next week.
Looks awkward.
What did you both do?
I really want to see her.
It was a stroke of luck.
I thought Tom was amazing.
I've never seen anything like it before.
I buy a lot of stuff in that store.
Did you receive the package I sent you?
I wish you were with me.
Try this.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
He began to scream.
I'll be there when I finish my homework.
Clean up a little.
Can I use your dictionary?
Did you manage to do it yourself?
Don't push.
Can we try this?
Most people like chicken.

I didn't do that either.
Are you ready?
Let's look again.

I don't believe it.
My mother died the day I got married.
Don't let anyone in!
What would Tom think?
We're not going into that.
This happens to everyone sooner or later.
That's my question.
Hold on, Tom.
Tom definitely pulled out a thicker end.
Follow me.
I don't care what your name is.
He's no match.
It's all right with me.
It's obvious Tom's sick.
I started learning English when I was twelve. Then I was interested in languages, but not to that extent. Now I speak English, French, Spanish and Portuguese; so, it's time to learn Latin.
We live in a very safe country.

We're lucky, aren't we?
I'm getting paid.
Compassionate.
Stop self-pitying.
He'll be done soon.

We have some options.
It should work.
She hated him.
As far as I'm concerned, I'm not opposed to your opinion.
Isn't that what you wanted?
I could talk to Tom about it.
It's just like that.
Take a little.
Who knows what will happen tomorrow?
I've been hungry since my run.
I'm a translator.
It was hot in every sense of the word.
Spider's sniffing me.
Talk about others so you'd like them to talk about you!

It's time to get up.
It's almost worth it.
Please, send me your picture.

A book that describes the wonders of nature.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
You don't have to throw stones in a glass house.
I'll scream.
Mary was silent for a moment.
Do you have a dog?
He exhaled.
I tried to get Tom to come home.
I'd get involved.
You can't touch that.
No, no, no, no, no.

It's not like that.
They know you.
I passed every test.

What's on your mind?
I'm gonna kill you!
I was cold as a squirrel.
There's no point in just waiting for something to happen; you have to do something right away.

What are you suggesting?
It is said that love is blind.
I don't have a home today.
I was just too busy.
Did you talk about me?

We did everything we could.
Do I ever sin?

You should probably talk a little slower.
Happy Mother's Day!
I need a beer.
You're not funny.
All the honors of Henry.
I thought you were married.
It was a great success.
Sit down, please.

Where have you been in Japan?
They're all gone.
I'll learn more diligently.

Don't overdo it.
Oh, yeah, I'll be busy tomorrow.
Nobody cares about me.
So what's the plan now?
I'm sorry.
I wasn’t home all day yesterday.
I'd appreciate it if you stayed until tomorrow.
I'm sure they need you.

I thought you wouldn't be able to do that.
We'll just follow you.
Tom asked me not to tell anyone, so I didn't.
Are we coming soon?
I'm not a prophet.
I'm sure you two will agree.
I hope I'm not the only one there.
Are you angry about that?
I'm divorced.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
That's why I'm so uncomfortable.
We are from Russia.
Costs will rise soon.

I'll probably never use this again.
That kid kept crying for hours.
I'd buy that one.
This goes beyond all boundaries.
I have a headache today.
Tell me where you live.

It's pretty good.
I was definitely lucky.
I hope that's true.
I wonder whose sentence this is.

Translation is not as easy as many people think.

Is everything okay between us?
I've never camped.
I thought the food was great.
I have to plan everything.
Let's change the subject.
We counted the years on the tree that we fell and found it to be thirty years old.
I'll see you later, Tom.
Would you like some fruit juice?
Let's schedule a meeting.

Did you expect anything else to happen?
Tom still seems to be stunned.
I'm a very sad man.
Boston is a great city.
We hope people will like it.

I could have gone, but I didn't want to.
I changed my mind.
Based on the data I brought out to you, which story would you go out with?
Who can't be proud of being a Serb, with their historical highest achievements - the slaughter of chieftains and genocides?
That makes it more one-room.

Will you invite her to the party?
Where did I leave the keys?
I'm a big football fan.
She came by herself.
I can't believe you didn't recognize your brother.
Tom lost his senses.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
He doesn't miss anything.
Tom will take a look.
I'm wondering if anyone could help me. I have a cell phone that only shows a message about an error.
I'm surprised.
They all laughed.
I miss her.
You should spend more time outside and less time inside.

Tom wrote on the ground with a stick.
Don't you want another glass of milk?
Cheers! Cheers!
Who is she?
I bought this yesterday.
Chances are against me.
I'm quitting.
The kids are playing outside.
It's all right with you.
Do what you want, I don't care at all.
She expects us to help her.
- Who are you?
Call me at any time. I always have shoulders to cry on.
Did I get fired?
I'm afraid you misunderstood me.
That's good.
I don't want to strain you.
Tell me what's going to happen.

I was happy yesterday.
By the way Mary slammed the door, Tom realized she was sad.
Husbands and wives should help each other as long as they live.

Tom made it himself.
Do you agree with what Tom wrote in his report?
He sneezed again.
Is that what's needed?
Take it all.
You've tried.

I wouldn't hurt him.
Would you be able to do that?
That aunt and the man hold hands, they're very good friends, aren't they?

I'll drive.
Don't open it.
I had a problem solving this problem.
I don't want Tom to see me naked.
I have one brother.
You're the most boring person I know.
Contact Tom.
We've been here all day.
You know I can't give you that kind of information.

I have a few friends.
I have to find her.
I can't wait.
I'll check.
Tom was shocked.
Just a minute, please.
We'll get you one.
Tom wants to know when you're done.
Call me back.
Tom's still shivering.
That's what the doctor ordered.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Tom knows what's coming.
I'm impressed.

Fadil wasn't in the house.
I've never noticed that before.
This is supposed to work.

What do you need to do?
I've always liked Tom better.
Where's Tom?
What can't you tell me?
Tom bought the papers and read them on the train on his way to work.
I have home ghosts.
Look at that.
We'll save this piece of cake for Tom.
You're funny.
Are Tom and Mary really married?
Horses sleep standing.
Let me try the other one.
You're working slow.
I didn't do that either.

I assumed you were busy.
Since when are you running?

The bill, please.

Don't worry, I'll translate it for you.
Where did I go wrong?
Tom's trying to help.
I missed so many opportunities.
We heard that she was crying.
It helped me a lot.
You don't have to scream, I'm not deaf!
Give me another example.
Tom still has a little time.
We have no choice.
Pain is boring.
Tom was more than generous.
She's violent right now, she needs to be avoided.
I was just stuttering.
I'm sure it wasn't intentional.
Tell him I'm innocent.
What are you going to do with all that money?
I'll see him in a few weeks.
Italy is not Greece.
It's for my friend.
They don't speak English.
We're lost, aren't we?
We're not gonna let you die.
Did you go to see Tom?
What's that?
He surrendered.
I can't wait forever.
This is the beginning of a new era.

Nothing's happened.
I baked an apple pie.
He has a good reputation.

Look how much it is!
We have to go shopping.
Tom's in the garage, working on his motorcycle.
Is your car blue?
Are Tom and Mary really friends?
Tom wanted to have a bigger boat than his brother.
Tell me what it is.
Let's hope Tom's smart.
He lied to you.
How many mosques are there in Istanbul?
He was late due to the accident.
For breakfast, I always eat fruits and berries.
You think I'm a dictator?
Who would want Tom dead?
Tom let us know he doesn't want to work for us.
I'm happy.
I'll stand.
We recommend that the water quality is checked once a year in the pipes, twice in the well.
Dear God, it's really hard for people when they have to draw your attention to one thing or another about you, your attitudes, or your looks, for example.
Don't be late.
What did you say?
Tom could have been better.
I'm sure they need you.
I feel like I've been thrown into a great void.
Do you agree?
Don't be afraid of dogs barking.
Are they still there?
Tom hasn't written to Mary in a very long time.
This story tells us some interesting facts.
"Yes, orange juice, please," said Mike.
I'm not coming with you.
Just be careful.
Would you mind if I interrupt you for a moment?
I hate science.
The students didn't know how to respond.
Do you have a book?
He has two cars.
If you don't bother them, they won't bother you either.
Good intentions are important.
I've been thinking about it before.
Men are children for the rest of their lives.
Stop trying to make me feel guilty.
Come on, admit it.
The two of us are so different.
I'll live.
I'm sorry I missed your birthday.
There was nothing to eat.
The girls were asleep.
I'm just looking around.
Where is the beach?
Do you want to know something specific?
Welcome back.
We're not sure.
We don't have any food.
I'm tired.
You don't have to tell me twice.
Interoperability is compatibility with other systems.
I love you, but not like that.
I don't know.
Tom was seriously injured in the accident.
Two-thirds of the students attended the meeting.
My mother is not like other mothers.
He canceled the meeting at the last minute.
That can't be true.
What do women want?
Tom said you were cool.
She received four e-mails.
You open the door.
That's good.
Who's Tom, is that your new boyfriend?
Put your clothes on.
When did you start writing songs?
I don't know why Tom went to Boston.
Why did you do that?
I hope you're not talking about me.
Don't give me that gun, I don't want to do that.
How did I miss this?
I'm relaxed.
Have you seen my dog?
Tom told me he'd do it.
Look at it again.
Do you speak French?
I'm objective.
Nine out of ten voters think that Maria is the most suitable candidate for the new leader. But Tom will not vote in this election.
I bought flowers.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
She came back from the hospital.
I don't want to read Tom's story.
I agreed to buy it.
He asked me to help him.
I'm Tom's grandfather.
What's going to happen now?
I brought a cup of coffee.
Build a city.
He is also well known in Australia.
Someone's called.
Just be careful.
Winter is a time of snow.
Under what name?
What are you going to do with Tom?
Good morning, how are you?
It's cold today.
My mother is Greek.
Be careful with your wishes, maybe they'll come true.
Tom is a third-year student.
Who's going to come with us?
Sounds like you've learned an important lesson.
Who are you really?
The way it happened, it happened.
Give him time.
Who's waiting, daughter?
I'll have to say, yes.
We've never been separated.
I'm 30.
Give me back my bottle.
I'm really happy to be here.
What the hell is wrong with you?
The doctor examined her thoroughly.
At that moment, it exploded with a big bang.
That's exactly what I said would happen.
Tom knows that more than 91 percent of Norway's population is supplied with drinking water from surface sources.
It's his, isn't it?
What's she drinking?
These are artificial tears.
Tom is very rude.
Don't forget to write a date.
She doesn't speak English.
Clear this mess.
Could you have read that?
Try it again.
That's perfectly normal.
How's your life going?
It is said that a new restaurant was built.
The price of this book is $5.
I want a sword like this.
Do you know how to keep secrets?
Tell her.

Quiet a little there.
Tom explained in detail, but I still don't understand.
I'm from Croatia.
I want to eat some cheese.
That wouldn't like it.
I will have to change my habits.
I met your father yesterday.
I'm really curious.
Are you a man or a woman?
Tom parked twice.
Can you speak Latin?
Will you help me?
Good morning, how are you?
Are you sure you're ready for this?
Come back here.
What are you going to do with Tom?
There was nothing to eat.
Everyone has the right to the protection of moral and material interests arising from any scientific, literary or artistic work of which he is the author.
Tom signed the bill.
There are islands at sea.
I've never had a problem sleeping.
Tom is hiding under the table.
I didn't see anything.
How many books can I take at once?
She went out for a walk.
Are there any other options?
The amount of work done and interest on the invested capital were several million.
Champagne, please.
I can't wait for tomorrow.
Is coffee good for you?
You never know what will happen tomorrow.
I'm the one who pays.
How many books do you have?
I'll do it myself.
You're sad.
All three of the boys laughed.
We're all tired of this.
I need something to drink.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
I don't agree with you completely.
Today is a beautiful day.
Do you keep this place for someone?
How are you these days?
You're a very pretty woman.
I really think we women have an extra sense.
Sunday has seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
I wasn't worried about that.
Will you come to Tom and Merino's wedding?
He asked me to help him.

The politician had sticky fingers because 5% of each contract ended up in his pocket.
I'll stay with the baby if you want to go.
I don't read novels.
I thought that was my job.
I'm a professor.
Tom said he wasn't an expert.
No, don't do that.
I asked Tom what he was reading.
There's no reason to panic.
He didn't even hear what Tom hates about us.
I don't want any beans.
Where do you live?
It's been a long time since I sent a letter to anyone.
What is the difference between imitation and real diamonds?
I don't want to grow up.
Tom turned off the engine.
Tom saw Mary with another man.
I was just thinking about you.
Don't fight.
Did you write the report?
Tom didn't want to talk to Mary, but he had no choice.
Can you go, Tom?
That man is a soldier.
Do you have Facebook?
American English is no better than British English.
Tom works about nine hours a day.
I hope I can.
I told you Tom was busy.
He's fair.
Not everyone could hear what Tom said.
Why would I want to kill you all?
Tom decided to sell the car.
I'll take a shower.
I'm happy.
It's mine, it's not his.
We have four hours of French every week.
Let's get started now.
I can't imagine doing that.
I've been training for months.
I know what you're probably thinking.
Fadil demanded that Denmark give him the money.
It's our only hope.
I got up on my left leg today.
He broke into my house.
The bathroom is upstairs.

I didn't know you were so rich.
It is a typical Gothic church.
It was a presentation that appealed to the audience.
Let me show you why you shouldn't do that.
Is this your notebook?
We've somehow survived.
Tom didn't exercise.
Thank you so much!
Keep your mouth shut.
It's fifteen to two.
I think you should do the test again.
Why would Tom give up?
The Europeans gained an advantage over other civilizations 500 years ago.
It seemed to me that Tom wasn't doing what he had to do.
I'll pray for your family.
Tom chased the flies away.
Suddenly, he stopped smoking.
I can't remember what I ate yesterday.
It's never here in the morning.
Even the kids know that.
Don't make a fool of yourself!
Tom asked Mary to refute the saying.
I have a cat and a dog. The cat is black and the dog is white.
Sarajevo is the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The cup is on the table.
That pisses me off a lot.
Is there still light out there?
I'm not hiding from anyone.
There's a lot of birds on the branch.
I don't have a cell phone anymore.
Don't thank me.
I assumed you were busy.
Do you agree?
Would you like me to look at your house?
You have to control yourself.
What's the difference?
I recognized him at first sight.
The French are our friends.
That's very nice of you.
She looks like a Greek goddess.
You have to trust me.
If I love you, what does it matter to you?
I wish that had come to my mind.
I drink milk.
Tom managed to get into the house through the window.
I saw a cat.
She doesn't speak English.
I saw a cat.
It's snowing in Paris.
I'm hoping Tom will be back safely.
I have no idea what was going on in his head, so he refuses such a favorable proposal.
I just got up.
How's that feeling?
Can you make Tom laugh?
I'd better clean it up now.
You tried.
My dog is blind, but he likes to go out and walk.
Don't leave me alone.
Whoa!
I'm sure Tom won't want to do that.
Tom is strict but fair.
Are you free this afternoon?
The three of us overeat with potato salad.
Come by yourself.
To be a good child, you need to go to bed and get up early.
All right, how about you?
I'm thinking of going abroad.
I didn't tell you to do that.
Where are you from?
I promised you.
My family goes to Italy every year.
It's not an easy sport.
Their friendship quickly turned into love.
Don't be lazy.
That's how it was supposed to be.
I eat a lot of meat.
I don't like to work.
Tom's a nerd.
The future looks dark for Edmond Dantes, as he is the victim of a conspiracy, he is convicted of treason and sent to prison for life.
You're irrational.
My French is bullshit.
We've survived somehow.
She covered her disappointment with a smile.
My mother chose this curtain.
We're both not as rich as we'd like.
A blow.
Can you let Tom know I'm here?
She did what she was told.
I'm bald.
I'll give you the money tomorrow.
You need one of these.
Is he a teacher?
Do you know how to cook?
Tom adores sports.
I learned French myself.
I like to walk.
I think I'm a pretty good writer.
I asked Tom to wake me up at 2:30.
Tom thinks the same way.
That's his weak point.
You're one of us.
Faith can move mountains.
One foot is in the grave.
Tom just told me the other way around.
Louder!
He was two years younger than me.
I'm sympathetic.
Tom is dissatisfied.
That would be a pleasure.
It's crazy like electricity.
I'm sorry I didn't reply to your letter earlier.
Do not drink water from a dirty glass!
What do you know about me?
I'm reformed.
All the songs I've been singing to you today, I've written.
That doesn't scare me at all.
We didn't play well.
How old are you really?
Someone's here.
Tom asked me if I had slept at all last night.
Why is love so complicated?
What if I'm wrong?
Tom seemed a little sick.
Here's her picture.
How can I forget those days?
I'm thirsty.
A friend of mine is studying abroad.
I'll contact you as soon as I get there.
Who's your favorite wrestler?
I'm glad to hear that.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
This place looks very different from what it used to be.
Is it yours?
Why Are Rabbit Ears Big?
I'm a runner.
I don't sing.
Souls do not exist.
I want to help.
I know how to do it.
I shot a bear.
Tom sent his son to bed without dinner.
Tom's a real idiot.
Oh, yeah.
Come and see us.
He lied to us.
That's quite a problem.
I'm looking at you.
Tom told me not to talk to Mary.
I love this song.
That's very rare.
What did I just do?
It's best to solve things on the go.
You're working too much.
This one's really cool.
Talk to no one.
I really enjoyed it.
You can trust that to some extent.
You're a teacher.
I bought a lot of stuff.
Would you like another glass of water?
My wife's from Ked.
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
That helps us a lot.
What do you believe?
I'm sorry, I'm late for the session.
What we need is a responsible government, what we have is a circus.
I'm sorry I tried at all.
It's a shallow river, isn't it?
I can keep a secret.
Tom helped me write this piece.
It's five o'clock in the morning in Brazil.
Tom hinted that Mary would do it.
Is this your phone?
We hate Tom.
This one's really cool.
Tom cut the tape.
Do you think the situation will improve?
Who is she?
Tom was arrested three times.
This isn't so much fun.
That's a big secret.
Mary said she would reveal the secrets of all her bosses if they didn't raise her salary.
This is not taught in school.
Is it clean?
I can't go out tonight.
"Will you think about it?" "Yes, I will."
Get out of there.
Fish can't live out of the water.
I have a book.
Is any of this true?
I had a vision.
Stop resisting! Stop resisting!
I'm cold.
I'm so busy I can't help you.
I have two colors.
Run! Run!
Please, wait a little longer.
I'm not gonna do that!
I'm tired of arguing.
Are you a maniac?
How was your day?
What am I looking for here?
They're good people.
She's a singer.
I love watching you play.
Every piece!
I'm trying.
I was definitely lucky.
What's the first song you ever wrote?
Tom might be able to stand up.
I just want to get away.
Dania continued to follow Fadi's example.
A large number of words are borrowed from foreign languages.
I don't want you to get hurt.
I'm mad at Tom.
Every other day Bill goes fishing.
Don't let him get away with a chance like this.
What time do you have breakfast?
Be vigilant.
It's the first year of college.
I was looking for grape juice.
I was thinking about my family.
Colorless green ideas sleep in anger.
Can you make Tom smile?
Due to bad weather, the plane was late.
Can I get your dictionary?
My fluent knowledge of language is enough for many situations, but not for expressing my often contradictory emotions.
I was in a great mood.
I'm a professor.
There's nothing to do in this town.
Tom's a scavenger.
Turn around for a second, will you?
The book is on the shelf.
I often feel a tremor in my heart.
Tom's on a secret mission.
I'm not blaming you.
They wanted to punish me.
I'm afraid of snakes.
I know this girl from somewhere.
I climbed once.
Show me the pictures!
She wanted to become a nurse.
I'm sorry I'm always bothering you.
Tom's risking everything.
He's a man of power.
That's wonderful!
I'm sloppy.
Can you pick us up?
Can you make it in time?
It's strange that the postman hasn't arrived yet.
Try to do one thing at a time.
How can we prevent this from happening?
His novels are a favorite among young people.
There's a cat.
I hope Tom remembers this.
Was I really that happy?
I'll be buying a boat soon. What insurance should I choose?
Tom said he wouldn't wait for us.
Close your eyes, Tom.
She was surprised to hear the news.
He's not an American, he's an Englishman.
How do you say “thank you” in Japanese?
There were no injuries.
Did you ever get a speeding ticket?
I'll be right up there.
We've got to go.
Tom's a mechanic.
His misfortune has taught me a lot.
Are we ready to leave?
- Why?
The storm shouldn't affect our plans.
Tom is a very good boy.
Tom's upstairs.
There's no girl on the internet.
She tried.
My dog is blind, but he likes to go outside and walk.
Like most 18-year-olds, Tom isn't sure what he wants to do with his life.
Vivaldi has written many musical works for the bassoon.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry broke his right sternum in a bicycle accident in France on Sunday.
Where there are many grandchildren, there are many grandchildren.
Tom is tense like a string.
Never give up hope.
Sounds simple, I know.
It was just a slap on the cake.
How long has it been since you stopped teaching at that school?
Tom looked very confused.
The results were unbelievable.
Choose one.
I'm sorry, I didn't remember your name.
The brakes squeaked.
Have you completely recovered?
He got what he wanted.
I'll listen.
The job was already done.
Tom spoke very loudly.
She drinks like a sucker.
Don't move!
The accident was recorded by an observer.
Did I drop that?
Are you happy?
This is the stupidest thing I've ever said.
I wish I knew Tom couldn't speak French.
Tell them we're coming.
Their friendship has gradually turned into love.
There's a saying in China that you can't judge a man by appearance.
It's useless.
Florence is the most beautiful city in Italy.
The left side of Tom's house is in Connecticut, and the right side is in New York.
They need each other.
What the fuck is going on here?
There are indications that the reception, which is known for its luxurious dishes, will be somewhat more modest this year.
Did you report to the police?
He gave up.
Italy is a beautiful country.
What's wrong with you?
You lied to me, didn't you?
I hope Tom does that.
Tom and I were friends.
I hope you and Tom have a good time.
Which way are you going?
I'm sorry if I let you down.
Violent criminals were often bullies in childhood.
Meet me with Tom.
After a long discussion, I ended up doing things by chance.
You owe me a lot.
He's a man who saves on words.
I'm really sorry about this.
Tom came to my house for dinner yesterday.
Look how big it is!
The living truth.
You're very uninvited.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to go.
This is a great time to buy one.
You're absolutely right.
He knows the names of all his customers.
Tom came out of it.
Tom was meddling among the people he never should have mixed up with.
Tom visits us from time to time.
Tell me what to write and what to write.
Tom is ruthless.
Tom was half right.
Tom ran down the street.
That's a problem you have to solve yourself.
I was exaggerating.
Termites eat a tree.
I take vitamins every day.
Tom dropped the book.
This should work.
You cheated on me.
You don't have to judge a man by his looks.
It's unrelated.
Am I in love?
Do you think I missed something?
Thanks for the email!
I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
They're gonna give speeches tomorrow.
What's this?
My hands are full.
Tom had no idea I was going to be there.
Tom told me he wouldn't tell Mary what happened.
Don't talk.
The team is as strong as its weakest member.
I've been there before.
Me, too.
It's different than what I expected.
Don't lie.
What are your plans then?
The kids are sleeping.
That was very good.
You need a temporary bridge.
I talked to Tom yesterday.
This town, like many towns in England, has a rather long history.
Tom closed the door.
I wasn't having fun, so I went home early.
Now it's time for the kids to go to bed.
Where's your stuff?
Tom worked very hard and squandered a lot of money.
I don't like to socialize.
Tom's alone in the living room.
He lived a simple life.
We offered help.
It was a dark and stormy night.
It smells delicious.
The first phase is complete.
You'll be famous.
He's got a lot of money, even a surplus.
We're glad to have you here.
Can I have another glass of beer?
Tom was sure of himself.
Sit down for a moment, please.
That's Copacabana!
I wonder how Tom feels.
She takes care of her old mother.
You're the most boring person I know.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
I have plants.
I bought dozens of pencils today.
I'm hurt.
Tom stayed with us for a few days.
Is French being taught at your school?
That can't be true.
Tom looked left and right before crossing the street.
Take a picture of this.
Who lives in the neighborhood?
Tom was in the audience.
Tom will recover.
You're important to me.
I don't expect anything from you.
Go straight.
Tell her.
I volunteered.
I don't see the difference.
Don't you dare.
I'm used to not liking anyone.
The brakes squeaked.
Find Tom.
You really made me proud.
You can see everything in black.
Just like a bean.
Now I'm a little worried.
Do you have a stable relationship with your boyfriend?
Tom still knows how to utter a song he wrote when he was thirteen.
It's empty.
Did you see that Tom was gone?
Just be careful.
How would you translate that?
I'm willing to pay you well to do it.
Where did you get that idea?
What are you talking about?
It was a tough decision.
This is from Australia.
I thought you'd be busy.
A lot of people admire him.
I hope it's a good time tomorrow.
Mary nodded.
Let's sit down.
Come and take a look.
Tom really seems familiar.
Trier is the oldest city in Germany.
I'm quitting.
Do your children have their own rooms?
Tom kept all the letters that Mary sent him.
Go take a swim with Tom.
She's safe.
Tom died in his sleep.
Women's chiffon is not complete without a little black dress.
I can't sit still.
Finish this.
We have no choice but to kill.
Where's the toilet here?
Happy Easter to you!
Tom helped me save some dinar by telling me about a cheaper place to buy it.
I owe you an apology.
You can't do anything but admire his courage.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Tom's been working his whole life.
Church! Church!
Which way are you going?
Maybe you shouldn't have told Tom that.
I need to fix my watch.
Tom will live.
Please read between the lines.
You won!
That's a bad sign.
I misunderstood.
Tom was having dinner with Mary.
Did you just meet her?
I'm nervous.
My mother died the same day I got married.
Isn't that what you wanted?
Was I really that happy?
I'm good with kids.
I'll be late.
I had lunch at speed.
You can't buy apples anymore!
There's a lot of traffic on the highway.
You should leave a message to Tom.
You're always lying to me.
Just in time!
I want to want what you want.
Health is wealth.
Tom now has a family.
That doesn't surprise me.
As far as I know, he never came on time.
Sweet dreams! Sweet dreams!
Someone needs to hire Tom.
Where did you find the keys?
You'll see her.
You're very rude.
The boy throws a stone.
Can I call you in 20 minutes?
Wind is a cheap and clean source of energy.
As little as we know of her origins, at least we can be sure that the pilot is Evangeliona.
I'm a terrible writer.
Tom got on the bus.
Can you leave us alone?
I almost forgot my passport.
Why are you doing this, if I may ask?
The deer is faster than stronger.
People used to write books with home-made machines.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
I live in Sarajevo.
I reacted instinctively.
It's the toilet.
Tom doesn't see anything wrong with letting Mary learn to drive.
Are you coming back now?
I want to fuck you.
I hope that's not the case.
Give me an example.
How could I hate Tom?
Wear this.
How barbaric!
What's tomorrow?
I always knew that.
Tom thought I was you.
I'm looking forward to your letter.
When the cat is gone, the mouse wheel water.
We need this from Tom.
The Emperor of Japan and the King of Spain.
It's Alina's book.
Will we see Tom again?
The world was on the brink of nuclear war during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962.
Have fun while you can.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
Are you dyslexic?
Melanie's drinking milk.
Where did you see Tom?
It's quiet again.
I'm faithful.
Can we order it, please?
What's he doing?
Otherwise, what's your address?
What I saw was depressing.
They laughed at me.
I'm angry.
Take it easy, Tom.
Can you set an example?
I'm not planning on going to Bust with you this weekend.
He stole a very precious diamond ring.
That's my cat.
Tom drinks like a sucker.
As in the good old days.
Tom knew what he wanted.
Is that what you want?
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Don't exaggerate.

Is it yours?
I already knew the truth.
I'm really happy about that.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
Be calm.
I'm not too upset anymore.
Bad weather didn't let me go.

I'm sure Tom didn't want to hurt you.
My French isn't that good.
Can't you see Tom's upset?
He's French.
I think we might have been too aggressive.
We'll never go back there.
No one knows what it turned into.
Fish is good for you.
They know you.
I can't.

What are you going to do this summer?
He put his thoughts on paper.
I'm a beginner.
I'm already used to it.
Listening to music is my favorite way to relax.
I didn't take part in the conversation.

He has one son and two daughters.
Here's your bag.
You're the boss.
He took Jane out for dinner.
Who broke the cup?
You're wasting your time.
What Tom said can't be applied to this situation.
There's a few reasons.
What are you going to do from now on?
I'm really proud of that.
Stop worrying so much.
What's the matter with you?
I like grapes.
What do you need to do?
It didn't matter to me.

You promised you'd help me.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
I feel good now.
To be honest, I don't know.
I saw the bus.
She can't stop us.
You're saying you intentionally hid your good side?
He's not the one who drank all the milk.
I don't sit on it.
Tell him.
Do you speak English?
He was a bare-breasted man and a boss.
Everyone says I look like my dad.
Come early so we can talk about the plans.
Tom, do you prefer dogs or cats?

You've tried.

I can't fix the car myself.
Zini! Zini!
Please, hurry up.
Tom nodded his head.
Do we have to tell someone?
He was flooded by the cold.
I'm getting better.
That's what Tom meant.
Don't be mad.
His memory loss is more of a psychological than a physical problem.
He exhaled.
He's starting to get angry.
As it came, so it went.
It's not as scary as it looks.
I'm mad at Tom.
Tom could have been better.

Tom's getting fat.
The spider took your car.
So what if that's true?

The result was very different from what we had planned.
A fish, please.
Aren't you done yet?
I'll have to think about it,

When can Tom come home?
Did you do that on purpose?
I can see a reflection of my face in the window.
Go talk to Tom.
You decide.
There's no use trying to persuade him.
I was thinking about my family.

He worked ten hours all the time.
This one's pretty cool.
That publishing company is solvent-based.
Choose one of them.
How did you find out where Tom was?
Stop looking for a prince on a white horse, they don't exist.
It's his, isn't it?
He's still going to be angry.
They can't recognize each other anymore.
I'm too old for something like this.
I don't fall for it.

What's this?

Anyway, you're wrong.
Redheads are driving me crazy!
I'm not bitter at all.
Man has many desires that he does not even want to realize, and it would be wrong to assume the opposite. He wants them to remain only desires; they have value only in his imagination; their realization would be a bitter disappointment to him.
Let me sleep for another ten minutes.
