Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned that they will “associate with the Mappets”
Some Cha are appalled by the recommendation to change the name of their position to "Member of Parliament of Wales" (MWP).
This recommendation came about through plans to change the name of the assembly to “Parliament of Wales”.
The whole political spectrum is concerned that this may provoke ridicule.
A Labour leader said his group was concerned about the rhymes with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside of Wales: in Welsh, "twp" means "unthinking" and "pwp" means an act of defecation.
CHA of the Wales Party said his group as a whole was "unsatisfied" and offered alternatives.
One Welsh conservative said his group was "unbiased" about the name change, but noted that the MWP could quickly become a "mappet."
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter "w" is similar to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter "u".
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to change the names, noted: "The final decision on the new name of the members of the Assembly will certainly be taken by the members themselves."
The Welsh Self-Government Act of 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public discussion of the proposals, and the renaming of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales received broad support.
As for what to call the CHA, the commission proposes to call them "members of Parliament of Wales", that is, the WMP, but the MWP option has received the greatest public support.
Of course, the CHA offer alternatives, but trying to come to an agreement could cause problems for chairman Elina Jones, who is due to file a bill on changes within weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes to the work of the assembly, including the rules of removal of CH and the structure of the system of committees.
CHA will hold a final vote on their new name when they discuss the legislation.
Macedonians go to vote on a referendum on changing the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The vote was organized with the aim of resolving a long-standing dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to Greek territory, and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, who opposes holding a referendum on changing the name, said he would ignore the results of the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is just the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Bells Are Silent Because Harlem Churches Are Experiencing Difficult Times
“The old people I spoke to say there used to be a bar and a church on every corner,” says Mr. Adams. —
There is no one now, no one else.”
He believes that the disappearance of bars can be understood:
“Today, people are socialized differently.
Bars are no longer the local living room they go to on a regular basis.”
As for the churches, Adams fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders hope, and “sooner or later they will be where they started.”
Churches, he added, can be replaced by houses with condominiums, and there will be people who will not help the shrines that remain nearby.
“The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these homes will be white,” Adams explained, “so it will accelerate the day when all these churches close, as it is unlikely that the majority of those who move to condominiums will become their parishioners.”
Both churches were built by white communities even before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870, and Saint-Martin — ten years after it.
The indigenous white Methodist community left in the 1930s.
The black community, which held ceremonies nearby, received the right of ownership of the building.
Saint-Martin moved into the black community under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street. These merchants did not want to take on blacks and raise them in the service.
In 1939, the fire severely damaged the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners wanted to restore it and installed a carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, the son and successor of Johnson’s father in St. Martin, proudly called the carillon “the bells of the poor.”
The expert, who played the carillon in July, called it in a different way: "cultural treasure" and "an indispensable historical instrument".
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merrieveser, in Saint-Martin he was not found a replacement.
What has been happening in Saint-Martin over the past few months is a complex story about architects and contractors, some of whom have been attracted by church leaders, others by the episcopal diocese.
The Council, the governing body of the parish, which consists of the leaders of the Myriads, in July wrote to the diocese, concerned that the diocese "will try to pass on the costs" to the Council, although the Council did not take part in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old Boy Who Dug Lobsters in California
According to officials, on Saturday, the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him. The boy dived after lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place at about 7 a.m. near Bik<0xC3><0xB3>n beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy calling for help, and along with the group swam to him to pull him out of the water.
At first, Hammel thought it was just a thrill about a captured lobster, but then realized that the boy was screaming, “I was bitten!
They tasted me!”
As soon as he reached the boy, he saw that his keychain was completely torn.
“I yelled at everyone to get out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” added Hammel.
The boy was taken to the Children's Hospital Council in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The type of shark that carried out the attack is unknown.
Rescue captain Larry Giles told a media briefing that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was found that it does not belong to dangerous species of sharks.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of the torso.
For the purpose of investigation and security, authorities closed access to the beach for 48 hours from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Encinitas.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is going to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by using islands with cosmetics similar to those in department stores. Working on the islands will be qualified sellers.
As part of the increased access to the British cosmetics market worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion (continues to grow at a time when the volume of sales of clothes and goods for the home is decreasing) the increased islands with cosmetics will be tested in 11 stores in the rest of the country.
Investments in cosmetics are linked to the fact that supermarkets are looking for ways to use shelf space, which was previously used for televisions, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury’s said it would double its cosmetics range and offer up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will get more space: there will be brand zones similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also updating the Boutique range of cosmetics: now most of the products presented will not be tested on animals, which is increasingly demanded by young buyers.
In addition, the perfume retailer Fragrance Shop is testing its trays at two Sainsbury’s stores: the first tray opened in Croydon, North London, last week, and the second will open in Celly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and the transition to buying small amounts of food every day in small stores forces supermarkets to make additional efforts to attract visitors.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury’s CEO, said their stores will become more like department stores as the supermarket network tries to counter Aldi and Lidl’s discounters with more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's opened Argos branches in hundreds of its stores, also opened a number of Habitats branches. Sainsbury's bought both networks two years ago and argues that this increased food sales, as well as made both networks more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to update the departments of cosmetics and pharmaceutical products ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tested the collaboration with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended after a dispute over how to split revenues from pharmacies in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury’s sold its pharmacy business (281 pharmacies) to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
They agreed that Lloyds would help by adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s commercial director, said: “We’ve changed the look of our cosmetic islands to make the atmosphere more pleasant for shoppers.
We have also invested in specially trained consultants who will be able to give advice.
The range of brands we present is designed to meet any need, and the pleasant environment and convenient locations mean that we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics, which is a competition to the old way of buying. "
Peter Jones 'disappointed' over Holly Willoughby's <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Dragon's Nest star Peter Jones is "shocked" over TV host Holly Willowby stepping down from a deal with his brand of life goods (the deal is worth <0xC2><0xA3>11 million) to focus on new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for the brand of homewear and accessories Truly.
The business couple was associated with the Goop brand Gwyneth Peltrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning has announced her retirement from Instagram.
Holly Willoughby led the star of Peter Jones's "Dragon's Nest" to the point when she finally stepped out of their lucrative life-saving business to focus on new lucrative contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones "disappointed" when the golden girl from the TV confessed during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of the business empire of Jones in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deals worth more than <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million are worth akstat, meaning that she does not
This business was associated with the Goop brand Gwyneth Peltrow and was to double Willoughby's fortune, which is estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of the UK to one of her holiday homes.
The source said: “Truly, no doubt, was Holly’s top priority.
It was to become her long-term future for the next few decades.
Willoughby’s decision to leave the business stunned all parties.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, almost on the eve of the launch.
The headquarters in Marlow is full of things ready for sale.
Experts believe that the departure of the leader of This Morning, which is one of the highest-paid stars in the UK, could cost the firm millions due to large investments in goods (from pillows and candles to clothing and home clothes) and create further delays with the launch.
It can also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby's mother and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Kapp, for ten years.
Willoughby and Capp created Truly in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman of the board in March.
The couple spent the holidays together, Jones owns 40 percent of the shares of the firm Baldwin, which is engaged in television production.
Willoughby will be an ambassador for the M&S brand and will replace Anthony McPartlin as the host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his case.”
Hard talk, "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he will receive from the news media for a comment that someone will consider “non-presidential” and for a very positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
“Why did President Trump make such big concessions?
Trump said, imitating the voice of the news host.
I didn’t make any concessions.”
He noted that Kim is interested in a second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
But the denuclearization talks have gone into a dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see a “appropriate response” from the US to its first steps towards disarmament.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. continues sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Speaking at his rally, Trump was much more optimistic.
“We have good relations with North Korea,” he said.
We were going to fight with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
We have such a wonderful relationship now.”
He said his efforts aimed at improving relations with Kim had brought positive results: the end of missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of the remains of U.S. military personnel home.
He also defended his unusual approach when talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be Presidential, but instead of the 10,000 people on the street trying to get into this battle-laden stadium, we have about 200 people standing right there,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island, hundreds of people died
In particular, after the earthquake in Lombok, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok has been affected, the national disaster has not been declared, and this is a prerequisite for receiving international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so it is somewhat difficult,” Sumbung said.
Although “Save the Children” is gathering a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet known if foreign staff will be able to work on the site.
Mr Sutopo, a representative of the National Disaster Reduction Agency, said the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether to allow international organizations to provide assistance.
Given the fact that earthquakes are constantly occurring in Indonesia, the country remains terribly unprepared for nature’s anger.
In the province of Aceh built shelters from tsunamis, but they are not characteristic of other coasts.
The apparent absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although the warning was in effect, likely contributed to the deaths.
Moving between many Indonesian islands is not just at the best of times.
Natural disasters complicate logistics even more.
A medical ship that was in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is sailing to Palu, but will be able to reach the site of a new disaster in at least three days.
President Joko Uidodo has made improving Indonesia’s infrastructure the basis of his election campaign and increased spending on roads and railways.
But the funding deficit has created problems for Mr. Joko’s administration, which plans to re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also disturbed by prolonged interfaith hostility in those parts of Indonesia where members of the Muslim majority have chosen a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed, tens of thousands displaced from their homes as a result of clashes between Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets using machetes, bows, arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Daniel Starridge from Liverpool scores a goal from the depth of the field and equalizes the score from Chelsea
Daniel Starridge saved Liverpool from defeating Chelsea in the Premier League with his 89th-minute goal on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge Stadium.
Starridge received a pass from Jerdan Shachiri when he was at a distance of about 27 meters from the goal of Chelsea. At this point his team lost with a score of 1-0.
He threw the ball on the left leg and charged it in the direction of the long pole.
The ball flew high above the penalty in the direction of the upper right corner of the gate.
He flew over the jumping Cape of Arrisabalaga and fell into the gate.
“It was just an attempt to take that position so as not to waste time. Players like Shachiri always attack as much as possible, so I just tried to get as much time as possible,” Starridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante approaching, and made one touch, I didn't think about it too much and just took the ball.
Chelsea led with a score of 1-0 after the first half, in which the Belgian star Eden Azar scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The attacker of the blues handed the pass back to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87>, turned around in the middle of the field and quickly ran for half of Liverpool.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> quickly played against the wall in the middle of the field.
Then he made a good penetrating pass, which led Azar to the penalty.
Azar overtook the defense and made a decisive left-footed shot at the grid of the long pole. The ball passed Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool will play against Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 15:00 on Wednesday at the S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the Indonesian disaster relief agency reported on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the debris of buildings destroyed during a 7.5-point earthquake that caused waves at a height of 6 meters, the agency's press secretary Sutopo Purvo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, home to more than 380,000 people, was dotted with ruined buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
Investigations into the murder began this morning after the woman’s body was found in Birkenhead, Mercyside.
A 44-year-old woman was found dead at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Moose, John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called for people to respond who have seen or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: "The investigation is now in its early stages, but I ask anyone who has been near John Street in Birkenhead and has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who might have filmed something on the video recorder, to contact us, as the information on these videos can be very important for our investigation.”
A police official confirmed that the woman, whose body was found, was a resident of Birkenhead and was found in the house.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know a woman arrived at the scene of the crime to ask where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and police said they are currently informing the victim's immediate relatives.
The taxi driver, who lives in Grayson-Mouse, had just tried to return to his apartment, but police said no one was allowed to enter and leave the house.
When he found out what had happened, he lost the gift of speech.
Now the residents are told that it will be hours before they are allowed to return home.
Someone heard a police officer tell one man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
At the scene of the crime, a woman appeared in tears.
She says, “It’s so horrible.”
At 14:00 two police vans were standing behind the fence, another one in front of the fence.
Several police officers were standing behind the fence and were monitoring the apartment building.
Anyone with the information is asked to write a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 and call the code 247 and the date 30 September.
Cromwell statue near Parliament becomes a new monument that will suffer from "rewriting history"
The removal of the statue would be a well-deserved retaliation for the Taliban-style destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by its fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell’s community called Mr. Crick’s proposal “stupidity” and an “attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Community, said: “Given the current debate about the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the Oliver Cromwell statue near Westminster Palace would become a target.”
Iconoclasm during the English Civil Wars was not carried out either by Cromwell himself or by his order.
Cromwell is likely to be undeservedly sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The majestic statue of Cromwell by sculptor William Hamo Tornaycroft is a testament to the mood of the 19th century and part of the historiography of the figure, which, in the opinion of many, is still worth respecting.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many probably more in the late 19th century than now, consider Cromwell to be a protector of parliament from external pressure, in his case, of course, a monarchy.
Whether such an idea is quite accurate is the subject of ongoing historical debates.
There is no doubt that the conflict of the mid-17th century determined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is one of the famous figures who represents one side of this conflict.
His achievements as a Lord Protector are also worthy of note and honour.”
Pig Killer Destroys Chinese Farmer to Death
According to local media reports, the farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in the south-west of China.
The man, identified only by his surname Yuan, was found dead in blood with a ruptured artery near a pig farm at a market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post newspaper reported on Sunday.
In Xinbei, Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2005, a pig farmer is going to vaccinate pigs in a pig farm.
He is reported to have left on Wednesday with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his brother found him dead and saw that the door of the piggy bank was open.
The brother noted that there was a large boar with blood on his mouth in the piggy bank.
A forensic examination confirmed that a 249-pound boar drove the farmer to death.
“My cousin’s legs were in blood and distorted,” said the victim’s cousin named Wu, who was quoted as saying by Guiyang Evening News.
A security camera recording showed that Yuan entered the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The head of the market told Evening News that when the police were gathering evidence at the scene, the pig was locked up to prevent her from attacking people.
It is reported that Yuan's seven and the market administration are discussing compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of attacks of pigs on people have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and inflicted critical injuries on their husband.
Ten years before that, the 295 kg pig kept a Welsh farmer pressed to the tractor until the farmer's wife scared the animal.
After an Oregon farmer ate his own pigs in 2012, one Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can become a “trigger.”
“They’re just playful.
They're like kids, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with due respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring extensive showers to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is projected to weaken as it moves over cooler waters off Mexico’s northern coast.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring rain with floods to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
The rose had a wind speed of 137 km/h (a Category 1 hurricane) at 5 a.m. easterly on Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to go north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean, a deposit begins to form, moving east to the west coast of the United States. When on Monday, Rosa will approach the Lower California Peninsula in the form of a tropical storm, she will begin to push strong tropical moisture north to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 25.4 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Further, in the coming days, the tropical humidity, which interacts with the approaching bedrock, will create strong tides in the southwest.
In this area from 2.54 to 10.2 cm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, garbage flows and the possibility of displacements in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will lead to an increase in precipitation of up to 5–7.6 cm per hour, especially in some parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
5–10.2 cm of rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially in a significant area of Arizona.
Flooding is possible with rapid deterioration of conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
We strongly advise not to go to the desert on foot, because tropical showers are possible.
Heavy rain can make the canyons turbulent rivers, and thunderstorms will bring storms and dust storms.
Approaching the foothills will cause heavy rains in some parts of the northern coast of California.
The amount of precipitation can exceed 1.27 cm, which can cause weak flows of rubbish and slippery roads.
This will be the first rain in the region during the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical showers will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and morning on Monday, and in the evening on Monday and Tuesday, the rain will become more extensive.
Heavy rain will go over the "Fore Corners" from Tuesday to Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature changes can be observed throughout the United States, as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to sharp temperature variations over short distances.
On Sunday, you can see a great example of sharp temperature changes in the central part of the United States.
This is a nearly 7-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the summer heat will try to return and spread.
A significant area of the U.S. center and east is expected to be warm by October, and temperatures from the southern plains to some parts of the northeast are expected to be 27 degrees Celsius.
Temperatures in New York City could reach 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, which is about 12 degrees Celsius above the average temperature.
According to our long-term weather forecast, there is a high probability of exceeding average temperatures in the eastern U.S. in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the hearing in the Brett Kavanaugh case
On Thursday, more than 20 million people on six television networks watched the astonishing testimony of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blaise Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual violence that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
The political confrontation continued, with channels interrupting planned programs to report the latest news on Friday: an agreement drafted by Arizona Senator Jeff Fleck to conduct a week-long FBI investigation into the indictment.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 per cent sure that Kavanaugh had drunk her and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh in his emotional testimonies said he was 100 percent sure it wasn’t.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched this on Friday, as reported by the research company Nielsen.
The company has calculated the average audience of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
It was not immediately possible to get the figures from other networks that also showed the hearings, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually has trouble measuring the number of people watching TV in offices.
For comparison, such an audience in size is similar to an audience watching a match of the playoff series or an Oscar award.
The Fox News Channel, whose leading opinion shows strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was the leader among all channels during the all-day hearing, with an average of 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen said.
ABC was the second of 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Fleck became the central figure of the Friday drama.
The office of this moderate Republican has published a statement that he will vote for Kavanaugh. After that, on Friday morning, CNN and CBS cameras recorded protesters screaming at Fleck as he tried to ride the elevator for a hearing of the Judiciary Committee.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes, during which he was barked, which was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m standing right in front of you,” one woman said.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
They said to him, "You have power, and many women are weak."
Flake said his office published a statement and, before the elevator closed, added that he would say more at the committee's hearing.
All cable and broadcast channels broadcast live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was to vote on Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate in its entirety.
Fleck said he would only do so if he knew the FBI would consider charges against the candidate next week, which is required by a democratic minority.
Fleck was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Kuns.
After a conversation with Kuns, and then with several senators, Fleck made a decision.
Fleck's choice was influential because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have the votes to nominate Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has initiated an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of “political games” around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interests.
On September 29, 2018, British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom.
In another interview, which ran alongside Theresa's front-page interview, former foreign minister Boris Johnson criticized her so-called Chequers Brexit plan, saying that proposing to Britain and the EU to levy tariffs on each other was "absolutely absurd."
Who shot at Wade Sims: police arrested Dayton Simpson on suspicion of killing a player from the University of Louisiana
Police have arrested the suspect in the shooting that led to the death of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from the University of Louisiana.
Dayton Simpson, 20, was arrested and sent to prison on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge police department said.
Officials released a video of a dispute between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
According to the affiliated CBS television channel WAFB, the police removed the glasses from the crime scene and noted that they found Simpson's DNA on them.
When Simpson was questioned, police said he confessed to shooting Wade.
According to the lawyer, he was assigned a security deposit of $350,000.
The office of the coroner of East Baton Rouge on Friday released a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The Department expresses its gratitude to the special search unit of the Louisiana State Police, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police and local citizens for assisting in the investigation that contributed to the arrest.
Sports Director of Louisiana State University Joe Alleva thanked the local law enforcement authorities for “the diligence and pursuit of justice.”
Sam was 20 years old.
Forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the University of Louisiana.
Last season his average score was 5.6 points and 2.6 selections.
On Friday morning, Louisiana State University basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
“That’s what’s bothering you at all times,” Wade said.
Volcano throws ash at Mexico
The ash that ejects the Popokatepetl volcano has reached the southern regions of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday urged Mexicans to stay away from the volcano, because the crater began activity and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center monitored numerous noises and shocks.
The photo on social networks shows thin layers of ash on the windshield of cars on the outskirts of Mexico City, such as Hochimilko.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in activity of the volcano, which is located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, after an earthquake with a force of 7.1 points in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters advocating for independence clashed with a special police unit. Thousands of people joined protests to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia’s vote on the separation.
A pro-separatist group in masks, which were held back by special forces, threw them eggs and powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually crowded with tourists.
The clashes took place and later that day, the police used sticks to deter aggression.
A few hours later, a group of independence supporters chanting “Let’s not forget, let’s not forgive!” came across the country’s conservationists shouting, “Long live Spain!”
According to the local press, fourteen people were given help in connection with the minor injuries received during the protests.
A year after the referendum on October 1, which was declared illegal by Madrid but is marked by Catalan separatists, tensions in the region, which seeks independence, remain high.
Voters mostly decided to vote for independence, but the turnout was low, as a majority of those who opposed the division boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year as a result of police efforts to stop voting at polling stations across the region.
The independence groups spent the night in tents on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to take a different route.
68-year-old Narcissus Termes, an electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hopes that Catalonia could gain independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry out of joy that they can vote, but now we’re in a dead end,” he said.
Despite a vital but very difficult victory in the regional elections in December last year, Catalan parties advocating for independence were unable to maintain momentum this year, as many of their best-known leaders are in exile or incarcerated.
Hoan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed a protest in support of police on the phone, said the conflict was provoked by politicians from both sides.
“The tension is increasing,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunqueras, one of Catalonia's nine leaders who have been in solitary confinement since the end of last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
“The status of a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and repression that we are seeing from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men Arrested After Car Enters House
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after the car entered the Londonderry home several times.
The incident occurred at Ballinagarde Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 British standard time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings noted that the gate and the house itself were damaged.
It is possible that at some point the car was shot from the armored personnel carrier.
Menga's strike ensured Livingston's victory over Rangers with a 1-0 score
Dolly Menga's first goal at Levingston was a winner
Raised in the Livingstone class, he stunned the Rangers and brought Steven Gerrard a second defeat from 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's strike proved decisive: Gary Holt's team rose to the same level as the Hibernian in a second.
Gerrard's team hasn't won a single Premier League game this season and next Sunday will play with the leaders of the "Harts", from which it is behind by eight points.
Prior to this, on Thursday, the Rangers will host "Rapid Vienna" as part of the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues its unbeaten streak to six games in the division, and head coach Holt has yet to be defeated after replacing Kenny Miller last month.
"Livingston" misses the chances offered by missing guests.
Holt's team had to be ahead of them long before they scored, because their straightness creates the Rangers with all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but made a blow along the gate, then Alan Litgow broke past the gate after he pushed and took a blow from Craig Hulkett along the gate which he made his head.
The hosts were pleased that they allowed the Rangers to play in front of them, while they knew that they could pose problems to guests from standard positions.
So a decisive goal was scored.
The Rangers missed a free kick, and the Livingstons made a breakthrough, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson engaging Meng, who took the ball and scored from the penalty spot.
Prior to this stage, the Rangers dominated possession of the ball, but the defense of the field owners proved impenetrable for them and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was mostly not disturbed.
This trend continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos managed to make a blow in the direction of Kelly.
Scott Pittman's kick was kicked by Rangers goaltender Allan McGregor. Litgow hit the goal in another standard Livingston combination.
The canopies were constantly flown into the Levingston Penalty and were constantly neutralized, and two applications for the penalty – after the attack of Halkett on Glenn Middleton, who came out as a substitute, and for the game by hand – were rejected.
The phenomenon of "Livingston": analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
The phenomenal game and the result of "Livingston".
Everyone played well against each other, they continued to exceed expectations on this upward trajectory.
Their style of play and composition has practically not changed after returning to the highest level, but should be given due to Holt for how he mobilized the team after his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett played grandiosely, organized the defense very well, and Menga forced Connor Goldson and Joe Warral to be constantly vigilant.
The Rangers, however, were not inspired.
They used to play very well under Gerrard's leadership, but now they're far from reaching that standard.
They missed the last ball — only once they broke the defense of the field owners — and it was something like an awakening for the Rangers, who were in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an was ambiguously accepted in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin, smiles and a blue sky were visible.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
Some disputes arose between them on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
For security reasons, the police did not allow 25,000 people to gather in front of the mosque, but many supporters of the president still appeared nearby to see him.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, including many Kurds, have also made themselves heard, condemning Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to invite him to the country.
Bilateral protests indicate the ambiguity of the guest, whom some German Turks have called a hero and others a dictator.
Road accident in Depford: cyclist killed in a collision with a car
The cyclist was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bethwood Street and Evelyn Street on a busy road in the Deptford area in the southeast of the city at approximately 10:15 a.m. British standard time.
The driver of the car stopped, and paramedics came to the scene, but the man died on the spot.
The accident occurred several months after another cyclist died after the driver escaped from the scene on Childers Street, about 1.6 km from the Saturday crash.
London police said they were working to establish the man’s identity to inform his immediate relatives.
Travel is prohibited and the routes of buses are changed, motorists are recommended to avoid this zone.
Long-Latrine Jail: Six Prisoners Injured in Riots
Six prison employees were injured as a result of riots in the male prison of the strict regime, the prison administration said.
The riots at Her Majesty's Long-Latrine Jail in Worcestershire began at approximately 9:30 a.m. British standard time on Sunday and are still ongoing.
To stop the unrest, initiated by eight prisoners and localized in one wing, a special unit "Tornado" was called.
Officers were provided with medical assistance in connection with mild facial injuries received at the scene of the incident.
A prison service official commented: “Specially trained prison personnel have been involved in resolving the incident that is going on in Her Majesty’s Long-Lartin Prison.
Six of the employees received medical attention in connection with the injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and their term of detention may be extended.”
In the prison of Her Majesty Long-Lartine more than 500 prisoners, among which the most dangerous offenders of the country.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison was sent for hospital treatment after the attack of the prisoner.
In October last year, a special police unit was called to the prison to stop serious riots, in the course of which prisoners were attacked with billiard layers
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with flooding (dry areas may benefit)
Tropical depression rarely hits Arizona, but this could happen early next week as the remnants of Hurricane Rosa head through the desert's southwest, creating a risk of downpours.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings on Monday and Tuesday on the territory from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rose is expected to go straight through the Phoenix on Tuesday, and there will be rain on Monday evening.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted on Twitter that only ten tropical cyclones have retained the status of a tropical storm or depression within 200 miles (322 km) of Phoenix since 1950.
and Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles (64.4 km) of the Arizona border.
According to the latest forecasts of the National Hurricane Center, in the area of Mogollon-Rome in Arizona is expected from 5.08 to 10.16 cm, and places up to 15.24 cm of precipitation.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive from 2.54 to 5.08 cm of precipitation, with places up to 10.16 cm.
Where there is no risk of flooding, the rain of the Rose can be a blessing as the region suffers from drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of these spills are likely to be beneficial as the southwest is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Center for Drought Monitoring, just over 40 percent of Arizona’s territory suffers from at least an extreme drought, which is the second highest category of drought, according to weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to shifts on the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
Rosa, still in the force of the hurricane on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 137 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at a speed of 19.3 km per hour.
The storm encounters cooler water in the Pacific Ocean and therefore weakens.
Thus, it is expected that in the strength of a tropical storm during the day or evening of Monday, the hurricane will cause a shift in Mexico.
Precipitation in some parts of Mexico can be significant, creating a significant risk of flooding.
“It is expected that the total rainfall from Lower California to northwest Sonora will be from 7.62 to 15.24 cm, in places possibly up to 25.4 cm,” reports weather.com.
Rose will go north through Mexico as a tropical storm, will reach the border of Arizona early in the morning as a tropical depression that will go further through Arizona and late in the evening on Tuesday will reach southern Utah.
“The main danger expected from the Rose or its remnants is very heavy rains in Southern California, northwest Sonora, and the southwestern U.S. desert,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening floods and waste streams in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer-Norton: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy with knife wounds was found in Somerset.
The injured teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at around 4:00 a.m. British standard time on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he remains in stable condition.
The 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Police are asking to respond to anyone who may have any video of these events on their phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh “tolerated the arrogance and anger” of the Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the relentless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “tolerated the arrogance and anger” of the Democratic Party throughout the expulsion process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, vehemently and emotionally denying Christine Blaise Ford's accusations that he committed sexual assault on her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at a hearing on the charges she brought against him.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day "the American people saw the brilliance, character and courage" of Kavanaugh.
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most accomplished lawyers of our time, a lawyer with impeccable public service experience,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president immediately recalled Kavanaugh's promotion when he spoke about the importance of the Republicans' presence in the mid-term elections.
“In five weeks, some of the most important elections in our lives will take place.
“I’m not running, but I’m really running,” he said.
That’s why I fight everywhere for great candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats’ mission was to “resist and impede.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's candidacy is expected to take place no later than Friday, an assistant to one of the Republican leaders told CNN.
Hundreds Killed by Indonesian Earthquake and Tsunami, Death toll Rises
At least 384 people were killed and many washed into the ocean when giant waves crashed on the beach as a result of an intense earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people rested at a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves up to six meters (18 feet) high crashed into the shores at dusk, knocking many to death and destroying everything in its path.
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake with a force of 7.5 points.
“When the tsunami threatened yesterday, people were still doing their business on the beach and did not immediately begin to flee, and they became victims,” Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a representative of the Indonesian disaster relief agency (PNB) told a briefing in Jakarta.
“It was not just a tsunami, it was driving cars, trees, houses, it was hitting everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that before hitting the coastline, the tsunami passed through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph).
To escape the tsunami, some people climbed trees and survived, he added.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The aerial photographs, published by the agency for the elimination of the consequences of disasters, show that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges have been overturned and destroyed, and the mosque is surrounded by water.
Shocks in the coastal city continued on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was felt in the area, where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said the energy released as a result of a strong earthquake on Friday was 200 times greater than the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical position of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have contributed to the tsunami forces, the agency said.
Nugroho called the damage "wide-scale" and noted that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found under the wreckage of the destroyed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho noted that the casualties and damage could be greater than 300 km (190 miles) along the coastline north of Palu in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
“The lines of communication were completely damaged, and we did not receive any information,” said Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers had left for the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can become much bigger,” the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency received widespread criticism for not reporting that the tsunami hit Palu, although officials said the waves had come at the time indicated in the warning.
Amateur footage, which people shared on social media, shows a man on the upper floor of the house shouting crazy warnings about the approach of the tsunami people on the street under the building.
A few minutes later, a wall of water crashed into the shore, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately verify the authenticity of the personnel.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a severe power outage that disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military began sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuated people are still in great need of food and other essentials.
The city’s airport has only been opened for help, and it will be closed until October.
President Joko Uidodo was due to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
Employees of World Vision from Donggali have safely reached the city of Palu, where they are hiding in tarpaulin tents set up in the backyard of their office, but on the way they have seen scenes of devastation, Doseba said.
“They told me that they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he shared.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups began decisive actions to eliminate the consequences of the disaster, some complained that foreign humanitarian workers with extensive experience are not allowed to go to Palu.
According to Indonesian rules, the financing, supply and provision of personnel from abroad can only begin if the site of disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“This is still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Auliya Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“Once the government says, ‘Okay, this is a national disaster,’ we will be able to accept international aid, but that status has not yet been granted.”
Already the second night descended to Palu after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, and the friends and families of those who have not yet been found, still hoped that the appearance of their loved ones would be a miracle that would adorn these gloomy stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the little boy was taken out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers found a woman lying under a rock for two days with her mother’s body nearby.
Hendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders to participate in the Asian Games, which took place earlier this month in Indonesia.
The other paragliders trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his disciples.
“As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Hendon tells how a few hours after the news of the destruction of the Roa Roa hotel, which spread among the paragliding community, he desperately sent a message on WhatsApp to Palu's rivals who participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages were marked with only one gray tick, not a double blue tick.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
The robbers stole $26,750 during the replenishment of the ATM in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who ran an ATM in Newport on the Levee, the Newport Police Department said in a news release.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to add more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the news.
While he was busy, another man "ran behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money destined for replenishment.
Witnesses noticed several suspects fleeing the crime scene, according to the news, but the police did not indicate the number of participants in the incident.
Anyone with information about these individuals should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his name to YES
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to YES.
On Saturday, announcing the change on Twitter, he wrote: "Formerly officially known as Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West was for some time called Ye, and he used this abbreviation as the title for his album, released in June.
The change took place on the eve of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
On the show, he replaces the singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her participation for "emotional reasons", the author of the show said.
This is not only an abbreviation of the current professional name, West had previously said that the word had a religious meaning for him.
"I believe 'there' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, I'm us.
Kanye, which means "one", has been shortened to just YES — it's just a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
Kanye is one of the few known rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, announced this year that he had chosen the names Love and Braser Love.
West's former colleague, J.A.-Z., also experimented with denominations and capital letters.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vows not to use military against civilians
The newly elected President of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use the army against civilians. Soon the country will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the bloody massacre of students.
On Saturday, in Tlatelolco Square, Lopez Obrador promised “never use the army to suppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, the military shelled a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing about 300 people. At that time, left-wing student movements began to establish throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He noted that unemployment and the lack of opportunities for education lead young people to criminal groups.
The US should double its funding in the field of artificial intelligence
As China grows in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in the field, according to AI investor and practitioner Kai-Fu Li, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments were made after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about AI, although the U.S. has no formal strategy in the field of AI at all.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it aims to become the No. 1 innovation in AI by 2030.
“A double budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the United States and we are preparing for the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the likelihood that the next big AI achievement will be made in the U.S., Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “Chinese AI Support: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of the Sinovation Ventures Foundation, which has invested in Face++, one of the most well-known AI companies in China.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on the AI system, which beat the best American player in Otello, and later was the CEO of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee noted previous competitions with technology conducted by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Agency for Advanced Defense Research Projects (DARPA), and asked when there would be next to help identify the next promising participants.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win state grants, Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes away academic leaders, it’s corporations,” he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired lights from universities to work on AI.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy can also help the U.S. increase efforts in the field of AI.
“I believe that the Green Card should be automatically offered to science candidates in the field of AI,” he said.
The State Council of China published its New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China is providing funding to individuals working in academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other U.S. government organizations are distributing money to American researchers, with the quality of academic work in China below, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to attract industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
As for the National Science Foundation, it is now investing more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, which sought to establish a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence, has not taken any steps for several months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia on Sunday voted in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", which will resolve a long-standing dispute with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia from joining the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims the name of the northern neighbor is a claim to its territory, and has vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments struck a deal based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents of the deal argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum, and because of the boycott campaign there are doubts about whether the voter turnout will reach a minimum of 50%, which will allow the referendum to be considered valid.
The question in the referendum bulletin is: “Do you support membership in NATO and the EU, subject to the agreement with Greece?”
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is the price that Macedonia, one of the countries formed after the breakup of Yugoslavia, should pay for joining such bodies as the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that it can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote does not entail legal obligations, enough members of parliament have said they support it to make it decisive.
It will take two-thirds of the vote in parliament to change the name.
The State Electoral Commission said that no reports of violations were received until 13:00.
However, the turnout was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary election of 2016, when 66% of registered voters threw their ballots into the ballot box.
“I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” said 62-year-old voter Gjoze Tanevski in the capital Skopje.
On September 30, 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorika and his son Dusko cast their vote in a referendum on changing the country's name, which will open the way for accession to NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and put chairs in front of tents organized by those who will boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to come there with a proudly raised head, not through the service door,” Kavardarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, for example, China and Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev believes that NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20%.
“I believe that the vast majority will vote for it, as more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after the vote.
He noted that the “yes” result would be a confirmation of their future.
According to a poll published last Monday by the Institute for Political Studies of Macedonia, between 30 and 43% of voters will participate in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
According to another poll conducted by the Macedonian TV channel Telma, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they would vote for it.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
The defeat in the referendum will be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since its start in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes the entire defense of Brighton and scores a goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling passed the defense of Brighton and brought a 2-0 victory to Manchester City on Saturday at Etichad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero's goal in the 65th minute of the match looked ridiculously simple.
The Argentine striker received a pass in the center of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between the three defenders of Brighton and found himself in the open field.
Then Aguero realized that he was surrounded by four greens.
He bypassed one defender, then bypassed several more on the edge of the penalty "Brighton".
Then he took a pass to the left, seeing Sterling.
The English forward made the first touch on the penalty kick to give the ball to Aguero, who with his right shoe launched it into the right side of the gate, defeating goalkeeper "Brighton" Matthew Ryan.
“Aguero has some problems with his legs,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We agreed that he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the time.”
But the Premier League's initial sky-blue advantage in this match was secured by Sterling.
This goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in the territory of Brighton.
He sent a beautiful penetrating pass along the left flank of Leroy Sanne.
Leroy made a few touches and then made a pass to Sterling in the direction of the long bar.
The forward of the sky-blues threw the ball into the gate just before slipping out of bounds.
City will meet Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer wants to take off his glasses in "Rokis"
Since the Washington Nationals team came out of the playoffs, there were no significant reasons to wait for another start.
But prone to rivalry, Sherzer hopes to go on the pitcher's hill on Sunday in a game against "Colorado Rockies" on the condition that "Rokis" will still have difficulty with the exit to the playoffs. Now "Rokis" is in the playoffs in front of "Los Angeles".
The Rockies at least have a wild card for a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday evening, but still seek to secure the title of the first division.
“Despite the fact that we’re playing for nothing, at least we’ll be able to leave the ball knowing how the viewers are doing here in Denver and the other team will probably be playing at the highest level I’ve seen in all this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate in this competition?
Nashionals are yet to announce who will be the starting pitcher on Sunday, but it is reported that they are inclined to say it will be Sherzer.
Sherzer, for whom it will be the 34th start, held a pitching session on Thursday and can play on Sunday, his usual weekend.
Washington Right scores 18-7 out of 2.53 ERAs and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's rallies in West Virginia
The president immediately mentioned the situation around his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the presence of Republican supporters in the mid-term elections.
“Everything we’ve done will be put on the map in November.
In five weeks, there will be one of the most important elections in our lives.
It’s one of the big ones — I’m not running, but I’m really running, so I’m fighting for great candidates wherever I can,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see this happening right now.
And they are firmly committed to regaining power, using whatever means, you see, arrogance, arrogance.
They don’t care who suffers from them, who needs to be crossed to get power and control, they want power and control, we’re not going to give them.”
The Democrats’ mission, he said, is to “resist and impede.”
“And you’ve been seeing this for the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “evil and ugly, disgusting and lying.”
He mentioned the Senate Judiciary Committee, naming Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein by name, which provoked the audience to loud outcries of discontent.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you provide a document?
Eh, what?
No, uh, no, I'm waiting -- it was really a bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a large church.
They are intolerant of those who express their opinions.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to convict me, it almost came as no surprise.
Finally, I am the last of those Labour Members of Parliament who have been told that they are not happy, and all because we are expressing our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated almost in the same way because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
I was convicted for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. These issues are ironically similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour Party said in a statement on Friday: “We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
Most of the Friday evening meetings of the General Committee in my eight years as a local Member of Parliament from Labour were just that.
Unfortunately, many meetings today have a completely different tone, and the promise of a “more friendly, more soft” policy has long been forgotten, if it was ever implemented at all.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different views are not allowed in the Labour Party, and each opinion is assessed from the standpoint of whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the party.
It started shortly after Jeremy became a leader. Colleagues with whom, as it seemed to me earlier, I had similar political views, began to expect that I would turn 180 degrees and accept positions that I would never agree with, be it national security or the only one.
Whenever I speak in public — and it doesn’t matter what I say — this is followed by a tirade of attacks on social media with calls for withdrawal, condemnation of the center’s policies, I’m told I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And it’s not just my experience.
I know that I have been more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments addressed to me are usually political.
I am fascinated by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face daily streams of sexist or racist attacks, but never give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that levels of abuse have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should nurture a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer such a broad church, and with every movement of “distrust” or change in the rules of selection, the party narrows down.
Over the past two years, I have been given a lot of advice. I have been asked not to stand out, not to speak out so loudly that “everything was fine” with me.
But that’s not why I came into politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolchild, because because of the lack of attention from the Thatcher government, my high school class literally collapsed, and since then I have been striving to improve the quality of public services for those who need them most, be it a local councillor or a government minister.
I have never hid my politics, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East was embarrassed by my political views and disagreements with the current leadership.
For those who contributed to Friday’s events, I want to say only one thing: in a situation where the country is moving toward Brexit that will harm households, businesses and public services, I don’t understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
In fact, I have another message, but not for the Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, as members of the Labour Party, no: I am proud that I serve you, and I promise that there are no threats to withdraw me from you and no political advantage.

Air 38-17 Melrose: undefeated Air rises to the top
The last two attempts may have somewhat distorted the final result, but, no doubt, Air deserved the triumph in today's excellent Premiership of Scotland entertainment match.
Now they lead the table, it is the only undefeated team out of ten.
After all, the excellent defense and improved ability to take advantage of the chances gives the hosts and coach Peter Merci the full right to be satisfied.
“So far we’ve been testing our games, and we’re still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Melrose's Robin Christie commented, "I'm giving the right Air, they were better off than we were."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt, implemented by Frazier Climo, brought "Air" forward, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, issued by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to show the numbers, and Jason Baggot was not used.
Climate strengthened the leadership of Air with the help of a penalty and right before the break made and implemented a solo attempt, which gave a score of 17-5 in favor of Air
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, implemented by Baggot, narrowed the gap to five points.
Then there was a prolonged delay due to the serious injury of Ruard Knott, who was taken off the field on a stretcher, and from the reboot "Air" was pulled forward with the help of Stafford McDowell's attempt, which was implemented by Climo.
Captain "Air" Blair McPherson then had a yellow card, and again "Melrose" forced another player to pay for an unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvin under intense pressure.
The masters returned, but when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for intercepting Klimo without a ball from the penalty line, McPherson made a touchdown behind Air.
Climo made an attempt, which he did almost every time after the restart, after which Kyle Rowe received a punch from David Armstrong in the box and sent flanker Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt of the masters' team.
It seems that the star of the series "Still still a game" is set for a new career in the restaurant sector
It seems that the star of the series "Still a game" Ford Kiran is set for a new career in the hospitality sector. Such a conclusion can be made after it became known that he is the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC television series, the script for which he writes and in which he stars with longtime comedy partner Greg Hamfill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kirnan is planning a life after Craigleng.
According to the official record, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source in the Scottish Sun suggested that Kirnan wanted to enter Glasgow's "thriving restaurant business".
"Our Sea": inland Bolivia hopes that the court will open its way to the Pacific
The sailors patrol the equipped navy headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings are hung by the ocean blue flag.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted with the motto: "Our sea is right.
We have to get him back.”
In Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, there is still a memory of the loss of the coastline, which left Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century due to natural resources, and there is a desire to swim again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are now perhaps the strongest in decades as Bolivia awaits an international court decision on October 1 after five years of hearing the case.
“Bolivia has an impetus, a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, it expects a positive result,” commented Roberto Calsad<0xC3><0xAD>a, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the announcement of the ICC's decision on big screens across the country. They hope that the tribunal in The Hague will take a decision in favor of Bolivia, which after decades of fragmented talks will force Chile to negotiate the granting of Bolivia a sovereign exit.
Here Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who faced opposition to his re-election next year, also has high hopes for a decision to be announced on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision in favor of Bolivia, and if it does, little will change.
The U.N. body, based in the Netherlands, has no authority to award Chilean territory and said it would not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ’s decision, taken only six months after the final arguments were made, indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Pas Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
The case of Bolivia has not progressed, the last four years could have contributed to a rollback.
“The issue of access to the sea was used by the current Bolivian administration,” Zarate said.
Morales’s belligerent rhetoric undermined the remnants of Chilean kindness, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue at some point, but after that it will be very difficult to hold discussions.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltse, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, disagreed that the court’s decision was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile and a chance to end 139 years of disagreement, benefiting each other,” he said.
Calsad<0xC3><0xAD>a also denied that Morales—still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents—used the maritime issue as a political crusade.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific,” he added.
This resolution is an opportunity to see that we must leave the past behind.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won’t happen if it can’t trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never give up its nuclear weapons first before it can trust Washington.
Mr. Rey was speaking at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made at the Singapore summit by the leaders of rival countries.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of restarting nuclear diplomacy, which has gone into a deadlock more than three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Jong-un.
Ri says the belief that prolonging sanctions and opposing the U.S. declaration to end the Korean War will one day bring North Korea to its knees is an “unrealizable dream.”
Washington is afraid to accept the declaration before Pyongyang takes significant steps towards disarmament.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning its arsenal, which the country probably considers the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
At Paris fashion shows presented the latest trend of massive headwear, which is already heading to the main streets of your city
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely hide from the sun, you have found what you need.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown showcased a number of eccentric oversized headwear from the Spring-Summer 2019 collection on the stages of a brilliant Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats filled Instagram this summer, and named designers have already sent their dizzying creations beyond the podium.
Valentino stood out with an extravagant beige hat with wide decorated feather fields, which covered the heads of the models.
Among other oversize accessories, watermelons, a magic hat and even a pineapple hat are decorated with precious stones, but they are not to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also demonstrated an assortment of original masks—very early on in front of Halloween.
Many of these multi-colored masks had sewn lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than high fashion.
One creature resembled an underwater equipment with a tube and glasses, the other looked like ice cubes that melted.
And if you support this serious fashion application, you are in luck.
Stylists say that huge hats can go out on the main streets of your city.
Oversized hats came into fashion thanks to "The Bomb", a straw hat with fields of sixty centimeters wide, which was seen on everyone: from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkovsky.
The iconic brand, standing behind a very impractical hat that could be seen everywhere on social networks, gave the world another creation: a straw beach bag the size of almost a model in a swimsuit that carried it.
The yellowish-red raffia bag with a raffia edge and a white leather handle was the central element of the La Riviera Spring-Summer 2019 collection by the Jacquemus brand at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “Next summer I expect to see big hats and beach bags on the main streets of the cities, because the influence of the designer is so huge that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for oversize accessories.”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is mandatory for the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland maintain high standards of learning, and in 2018, excellent exam results were again obtained, complemented by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other fields.
These schools, which have more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SNCS) and are committed to providing the best possible service for pupils and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, their chosen careers, as well as to make them citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an individual school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a person in a language he understands, he perceives it with his mind.
If you speak to her in her native language, she perceives it with her heart.”
It’s a powerful reminder that we can’t just use English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the latest results of the exams this year, we see that in independent schools, languages lead in the rankings of the subjects with the best scores.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages received a higher A score.
The data collected at 74 schools in the SNSH showed that 72% of students received a higher grade A from Chinese, and another 72% of those who learn German, 69% of those who learn French, and 63% of those who learn Spanish also received an A.
This indicates that independent schools in Scotland consider foreign languages to be vital skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Now languages as a subject of choice are taught in the same way as NTIM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), within the framework of independent school programs and in other institutions.
A survey conducted by the British Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 found that 17% of the reasons employers cannot close vacancies are due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary in preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more promising positions require knowledge of languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if someone has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future, because it is a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who speaks several languages an advantage over competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to support the conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage (15%).
That’s why investing in language teaching is now important for today’s children.
Knowledge of several languages, especially the languages of developing countries, will provide children with a better chance of finding a full-time job.
In Scotland, each school will learn its own language.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK from the perspective of 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests in independent schools, you will always be able to choose several languages to study them with qualified teachers.
Scottish independent schools are trying to create an educational environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills necessary to succeed, regardless of what prepares them for the future.
Now there is no denying that in the international business environment languages continue to be of vital importance for the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
Modern languages should really be considered “skills of international communication”.
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity, and excellence to Scottish youth.
You have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron makes his Lakers debut in San Diego
Fans who want to see the first start of LeBron James for the Los Angeles Lakers have almost waited.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Sunday in the first pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he will play is not yet decided.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six games of the Lakers pre-season schedule.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare,” he said.
Trump's rallies in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of pre-election rallies in Willing, West Virginia.
This is the first of five Trump rallies scheduled for next week, including rallies in friendly states, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
The final vote on the candidacy he proposed to the Supreme Court has been postponed, and Trump is keen to form support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time will Trump’s rally in West Virginia take place tonight and how to watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Willing, West Virginia is scheduled for 19:00 Eastern time today, Saturday, September 29, 2018
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia online below live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to recall the tense hearings this week over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of sexual misconduct, and the deferral of the Senate vote for a week while the FBI investigation continues.
But the main purpose of this series of rallies is to help Republicans gain popularity before the November elections.
Representatives of President Trump said that these five rallies next week are aimed at “activating volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to preserve and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” Reuters reported.
"Control of Congress is so critical to its agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible, because the tense season of the election campaign is approaching," a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media from Pittsburgh, could attend the planned rally at the Wesbank Arena in Willing, West Virginia Metro News reports.
Saturday’s visit will be Trump’s second in a month to West Virginia, where he won more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican Senate nominee Patrick Morris, whose rating lags behind polling results.
“It’s not good for Morrissey that the president is coming to raise his rating in polls,” Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: U.S. team set to fight and hopeful ahead of Sunday singles
After three sessions, which ended in a one-sided victory, the afternoon Saturday forks could become exactly what was missing from this Ryder Cup.
An emergency pulse pendulum is a completely fictional sports concept that players really believe in, especially in such competitions.
So, when do they say that the impulse is working?
“They were six points ahead, and now they’re four, so I think we’re seeing that as a bit of an impulse,” Spite said as he left.
Europe has the advantage, of course, four points ahead and another twelve in the game.
The Americans, as Spit says, feel a little wind in their sails, and they are also much encouraged, not least by the shape of Spit and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each earned three points out of four.
Spit with his deadly blows from t-top to green shows an example.
These squeaky cries of celebration became louder when, in continuation of his round, he made a decisive pat and equalized the score in the fourth match after he and Thomas were two points behind.
His pat, which allowed them to win the match on the 15th, met with a similar scream, one that tells you that the American team does not give up.
“You really just have to try hard and worry about your own game,” Spit said.
This is all that each of these players has left now.
18 holes to become famous.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Rider's Cup.
An unusual but charming couple from Europe has four out of four and can not make mistakes.
The Mollywoods were the only couple who did not make the gods on Saturday afternoon, they also managed to avoid the gods on Saturday morning and after lunch on Friday and on the last nine holes on Friday morning.
This run and how their energy seems to flow to this turbulent crowd and back makes them believe that they will win on Sunday and that there will be no more popular players except Fleetwood or Molinari to cement the potential victory of the Europeans when the sun sets.
Preferably both at the same time on different holes.
However, it is too early to talk about the triumph of Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dealt with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning forballs, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
One of the gods and two dubbings in the first nine holes led the Spaniard and Swede to a hole from which they could never get out.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you get out of the hole.
For foreplay and foreplay is very interesting to watch closely because of the interaction between the participants of the couple, because of the advice they give, the advice they do not give, and also interesting to watch how the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe still plays better as a team and has a significant advantage in the last day, but this session of forcing has also shown that the U.S. team intends to fight, something that some, especially Americans, doubt.
Europe leads with a score of 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
On the final day of the Rider's Cup Europe will have a solid advantage, because after Saturday's forecourts and forecourts it is ahead of the United States with a score of 10-6.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari won two victories over the lagging Tiger Woods, and now at Le Golf National they have four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who is trying to return the trophy they lost to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team in the morning forballs with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. made more resistance in forcing and won two games, but could not shorten the gap.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points in 12 Sunday singles to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while he and Mollinari (together with Mollywood) are only the second pair to score four points in the first four games in the history of the Raids Cup.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in the forecourts, they teamed up to defeat the bloated Woods and rookie American Bryson Deshambo with an even more spectacular 5th.
Woods, who pulled out two games on Saturday, showed incidental flashes of genius, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in forecourts and forecourts and seven games in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not take part in the morning forecourts, returned to partner Henry Stanson in forecourts to be defeated with a 2nd-1 score by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Coepka, who are the first and third in the world rankings.
Europe has not been able to do everything in its own way on this pleasant fresh day south-west of Paris.
Three-time top scorer Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas set the standard for Americans on Saturday with their two points.
They took a decisive 2nd-1 victory over the Spaniards John Ram and John Paulter in the forecourt and later defeated Paulter and Rory Maclear with a 4th-3 in the forecourt, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team returned with a deficit of four points in the singles, although the team of Furic to keep the trophy only needs none.
However, after the second place in two days, the counterattack on Sunday looks as if it is not in their power.
North Korea says it will “in no way” disarm unilaterally without trust.
North Korea’s foreign minister said on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions deepens distrust of the United States, and that under such circumstances the country will not be able to give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual UN General Assembly last year that North Korea had taken “substantial goodwill measures” such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of the nuclear test site and the commitment not to distribute nuclear weapons.
“However, we do not see a corresponding reaction from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, we will not be the first to disarm unilaterally.”
And although Ri repeated familiar complaints from North Korea about Washington’s opposition to the “stage-by-stage” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea will be rewarded for gradual steps, his statement was important in the fact that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization.
Ree referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between the current US president and the leader of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, when Kim called for work on "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" and Trump promised security guarantees.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first abandon nuclear weapons.
Washington is also resisting calls to weaken tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'denuclearization first' and increases the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal forcibly, and even denies the 'declaration of the end of the war'," Ri said.
“To think that sanctions can put us on our knees is an impossible dream for those who do not know us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our mistrust.”
Ree did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader emphasized at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If South Korea were the party to the denuclearization issue, not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have gone that way."
Despite this, the tone of Ri’s speech was sharply different from last year’s when he told the General Assembly that targeting North Korea’s missiles on the U.S. mainland was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “missile man” who wants to do it himself.
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said much more would need to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump remarked that he did not set a time frame for this: “It will take two years, three years, or five months — it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of the Security Council’s sanctions must continue vigorously and steadfastly until we see complete, final, confirmed denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to block the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear programs and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
He left Pyongyang in July and commented that progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea condemned him for "gangster demands".
During a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle the missile complex, as well as the nuclear complex, if the United States takes “appropriate measures.”
He said that, according to Kim, he needs "appropriate measures" are guarantees of security that Trump promised in Singapore, and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has provided all of its students with more sleep. This is an attempt to combat the growing culture of steep learning all night after a caffeine filling.
The professor found that world’s number one university students are often uneducated when it comes to the very basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chassler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Women’s Hospital, has developed a course that he believes is the first such course in the United States.
He decided to start the course after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end, a girl approached him and said, “Why am I being told this now, in my last class?”
“She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” said a lecturer at The Telegraph.
In the course, which was first introduced this year, students are explained the basics of how good sleep habits help to achieve academic and sporting results, as well as improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of medical services at the university, said the university decided to introduce a course after it was found that students were severely sleep deprived for a week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a dormitory room where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, gymnasts and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, the impact of sleep deficiency on sports performance, and the importance of sleep-related routines.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Next, the campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know this won’t change the behavior of students instantly.
But we believe they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes,” Professor Chassler added.
A culture of pride for “insomnia all night” still exists, he added, and also noted that modern technologies and the ever-increasing pressure on students mean that the problem of sleep deprivation is growing.
Adequate sleep of good quality should be a student’s “secret weapon” to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, even with a set of excess weight, as sleep deprivation translates the brain into a mode of hunger that causes constant physical hunger, he said.
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chassler develop a course after enrolling in one of his other courses last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that course opened his eyes and inspired him to create a new course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to appeal to all postgraduate students with a request to undergo a similar study program before coming to a competitive institution.
Professor Chassler recommends that students put a reminder to go to bed and set an alarm and be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” that is emitted by electronic screens and LED lamps and can disrupt the circadian rhythm, leading to problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal saddened Gerrard's boys
The Rangers experienced another attack of outgoing grief: Dolly Menga's blow brought a 1-0 loss to Steven Gerrard's disenfranchised team from Livingston.
The team of "Ibrox" sought to get their first victory in the away match after the February triumph over "St. Johnston" with a score of 4-1, but the team of Gary Holt defeated Schrard's second defeat as the manager of the 18 games.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers lineup, which lacked inspiration, did not look like it could equal the score.
Now the Rangers have fallen to sixth position, and the Livingstons have risen to third, and by the difference of the balls they are ahead of only the Hibernian.
In addition, the Rangers may face another problem, as lineman Kalum Spence was forced to treat the head wound after he was thrown into some object from the guest sector.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that once missed out on Air in the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
And Holt released the same line-up of Lefty 11, which took one point at the Charts last week, and was thrilled by how his enforced guys crushed opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have dominated possession of the ball, but the Livingstons worked more with the resulting ball.
They were to score just two minutes later when Menga's first pass to the free zone allowed Scott Pittman to hit Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder squandered that great chance by sending the ball past the goal.
Keagan Jacobs's deep free kick hit skipper Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Litgow hit the rear bar
The Rangers really got control, but in the last third there was more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should get the right to a penalty on the score a quarter of an hour after the collision with Stephen Lawless, but referee Stephen Thomson refused to appeal to the Colombian.
The Rangers managed to make only two strikes in the first half, but former Ibrox goaltender Liam Kelly's header hit by Lassana Kulibali and the calm strike of Oviedo Ejaria almost did not bother.
And while the 34-minute Levingston goal may have contradicted the game’s progress, no one can deny that they deserved it only with their hard work.
The Rangers once again failed to cope with Jacobs' gains.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who calmly chose Meng for a simple finish.
During the break, Gerrard replaced Kulibali with Ryan Kent, and this change worked almost immediately when the winger broke into Morelos, but the striking Kelly ran out of his line to block him.
However, Livingston continued to force guests to play the kind of game they liked when Litgow and Halkett made one long pass after another.
Holt's team could have improved the result in the final stages, but McGregor did well against Jacobs before Litgow hit from the corner.
Glenn Middleton, a replacement for the Rangers, made another late application for a penalty when he ran into Jacobs, but Thomson took a look again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the page from our almanac “Sunday Morning”: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago on this day, and the time is coming... in Germany was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactive radiation, an invention that over time evolved into a device known as a Geiger counter.
Since then, Geiger has become one of the key elements of science, as well as one of the key elements of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film Coronado Bells with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who play dubious-looking cowboy scientists.
The man: “What is it?”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter that is used to look for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you can really hear how radioactivity in minerals affects atoms.”
Evans: “Well, it’s really cracking now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name, continues to live.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to ‘See’ Malignant Cells
New cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to “see” malignant cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize the malignant cells that are part of the treatment
The method involves the removal of immune cells in the patient and their change in the laboratory
Then these cells are able to "see" a protein that is common to many cancers. Then these cells are re-injected into the patient.
The trial vaccine demonstrates promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one woman who received a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that these cells can “see” the common for many types of cancer proteins (HER2), and then re-introducing these cells to the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. Bethesda National Cancer Institute, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have received a very promising vaccine.”
“HER2 “stimulates the growth of several cancers,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer,” he explained.
A similar approach, which involves removing immune cells from patients and “learning” them to target cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of one of the types of leukemia.
After appearing in the studio of the SNL show in the baseball game MAGA Kanye West stunned with a sharp speech in support of President Trump,
What caused the negative reaction of the audience?
Viewers in the studio of the show SNL (Saturday Night Live) cheered Kanye after his turbulent speech, during which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After performing a third song titled Ghost Town in a baseball bat with the caption “Return America to Former Glory,” he exploded a tyranny in which he criticized the Democrats and once again expressed his support for Trump.
“Often during the conversation, white people ask me, ‘How do you like Trump? He’s a racist.’
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL show began with a sketch by Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Legal Committee in a lawsuit by Christine Blaise Ford over sexual assault.
Although Vest's speech was not broadcast live, the video with his team was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It remains unclear whether Rock wanted to ridicule Vest by posting this post.
West also complained to the audience that behind the scenes an unpleasant situation happened to him because of his headdress.
According to the Washington Examiner, West said: “When I was behind the scenes, they treated me roughly.
I was told, “Don’t go out to the audience in this baseball bat.”
They mocked me!
And then I’m told that I’m in a place where the oppressed are silent.”
West continued, "You want to see a place where the oppressed are silent? I'm going to wear my superman baseball cap because no one will be able to tell me what to do. You want the world to keep moving forward?
Then try to treat each other with love.”
According to Variety, his comments caused a negative reaction of viewers in the hall at least twice, and the actors of the show SNL looked confused. One of the viewers said: "The studio was dominated by dead silence".
Vesta was asked at the last minute to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days before the air.
West caused many surprises by performing the song I Love It in a Perrier water bottle suit.
Vesta was endorsed by the head of the conservative organization TPUSA Kendes Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "One of the most courageous: THANK YOU FOR THINGS THAT RESISTED AGAINST NATOPU".
Instead, talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West "is who he is, and it's just great."
"However, I will not reward (buying his music or his clothes or supporting his 'art') who, in my opinion, professes and eradicates an ideology that harms my community.
He is a free man.
Just like us,” she added.
Before performing on the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name: he is now "the one previously known as Kanye West".
West is not the first performer to change his name. He follows the example of Diddy, also known as Puffy Daddy, Puffy and Pi Diddy.
Rapper Snoop Dog was previously called Snoop Lion, and as is known, the musical legend of recent decades Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then became "Artist, formerly known as Prince".

A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after inflicting a knife wound on another man at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.

The prosecution will consider the charges.
"Game of Thrones" star Keith Garington condemns the idealization of brutality
Keith Garrington became famous for his role as a warrior with the sword of John Snow in the brutal medieval fantasy series "Game of Thrones" produced by HBO.
However, the 31-year-old actor spoke out condemning the macho-hero stereotype, claiming that because of such characters on screens, young guys often feel that they have to be cool to be respected by others.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said that, in his opinion, "something went wrong" and asked how to solve the problem of idealizing brutality in the era of popularity of the hashtag #MeTo.
Keith, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star, 31-year-old actress Rose Leslie, said he was "quite determined" to deal with the problem.
"I am at the moment quite determined. When did we get on the slippery path of idealization of brutality?" he asked.
"Why do we teach future men if we look at their growing up through the prism of the problem we see now?"
Keith believes that television is partly responsible for the popularization of brutality through images of extremely courageous heroes.
He continued: "What is natural, and what are we planted?
Why does television and the street teach that young boys feel the pressure to be such men?
In my opinion, today’s really important question is “How can we change this?”
It is obvious that the young guys are off the right track.”
In an interview, he also noted that he will not appear in any prequels and sequels to Game of Thrones after the show's completion next summer, as "he's already done with battles and horses."
From November, Cat will play in the production of the play "The Real West" by Sam Shepard - a story about the film producer and his brother-robber.
As the actor recently admitted, he considers the meeting with his wife Rose the best he has received from participating in the series "Game of Thrones".
“When I was shooting this series, I met my wife, so he gave me a future family and defined my future life,” said Keith.
In the fantasy series, which received the "Emmy", Rose played Igritt - the love of the hero of Gerington John Snow.
The couple got married in June 2018. The ceremony was held on the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a sharp increase of 14% in the number of new cases of the disease
In China, a sharp increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS was reported.
According to the representatives of the health authorities, there are more than 820,000 patients in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases of the disease were reported.
In most cases, the disease was sexually transmitted, indicating a change in the past trend.
For a long time, in some regions of China, HIV spread rapidly through infected blood during transfusions.
However, according to official health officials at a conference in Yunnan province, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero.
However, compared to the previous year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV over time is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
The decriminalization of homosexuality in China took place in 1997, but the LGBT community often suffers from discrimination.
According to studies, 70-90% of men who have sex with other men later marry women because of the dominance of conservative values in the country.
The transmission of the disease in most cases occurs as a result of improper use of protective measures during sexual contact.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to provide free access to HIV medicines, seeing this as a way to partially solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaking Republican senators’ data to the network by her staff member and sharply criticizes “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
On Saturday, U.S. House of Representatives member Maxine Waters denounced blatant claims that one of her staff posted the personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
A Democrat from Los Angeles claims that these statements are spread by “ultra-right” political viewers and websites.
“Lies, lies, and then even more disgusting lies,” Waters said on Twitter.
The information was reported to contain the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrina Getcha of Utah.
The data appeared on the network on Thursday, posted by an unknown person from the Capitol during hearings in the Senate committee on charges of sexual misconduct brought against Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the position of a judge of the U.S. Supreme Court.
The leak occurred some time after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
The Hill newspaper reported that on conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, there was information that the IP address of the leaked source was associated with the Waters office and that it was able to find the data of its staff member.
“These unfounded claims are absolutely false, they do not correspond to reality,” Waters continued.
“An employee of my office, whose personal data and security are endangered as a result of these fabricated and false statements, has nothing to do with the leak of this information.
These unfounded statements are absolutely false, they do not correspond to reality.”
Waters was quickly criticized online, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleisher.
“This denial is filled with anger,” Fleisher wrote.
“This suggests that with this character, she cannot be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, there is no need to be angry.
The accused should not act insolently.
He should not ask about the motives of the accused.
He must remain calm and unmoved.”
It appears that Fleisher drew parallels between Waters’ reaction and Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of looking too angry during Thursday’s hearings.
Omar Navarro, a candidate from the Republican Party who is running to replace Waters after the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“This is news if it’s true,” he wrote.
In a statement, Waters said her office had already notified “the relevant state and law enforcement authorities of these false statements.”
“We will do everything possible to find the culprits,” she continued, “and they responded to the law for their actions, which are harmful and dangerous to all my employees.”
Review of the film "Agent Johnny English: A New Mission" – a passing parody of spy fighters with Rowan Atkinson
It has already become a good tradition to look in every new British film for the senses inspired by Brexit. There are also in the new part of the series of comedy parodies on the militants about Johnny Inglesh. The first film called "Johnny Inglesh" was released on the screens in 2003, relaunching the series in 2011.
Will the ridiculously ironic self-satisfaction at what we are short-lived become the nation’s new export potential?
One way or another, Johnny English, with his movable face and bulging eyes, was given a second chance to make a mess, with his name more than anything else indicating that this comical character was created for viewers in non-English-speaking countries.
As you know, Johnny is a recklessly cheerful secret agent, in which, despite his strange attempts to be gallant and magical, there is a little bit of Inspector Clouseau, a little bit of Mr. Bean and a lot of – from the guy who played one note of the melody in the film "The Fireworks" in London.
The prototype character is also a traveler and an international mystery that has always left behind the mess that Atkinson once played in the long-forgotten television commercial of the company Barclaycard.
In the last film about Johnny English, there are a few good moments.
I liked the scene when Johnny English was approaching the helicopter in his knightly armor, and the blades of the screw were hovering over his helmet.
The film is well revealed Atkinson's talent to arrange a buffoon, but the humor is transient, and in some moments it is too much, especially when compared to "serious" movie brands, such as "Agent 007" and "Mission Impossible", one of the "ingredients" of which are also comedies.
It seems that the jokes are aimed at children rather than adults, and the senseless attacks that happen to Johnny Inglesh do not seem as inventive and thoughtful as the Atkinson jokes in the silent films about Bean.
As always, the film begins with the fact that there is a serious threat to the UK.
In the British super-secret network of spies penetrates the hacker and reveals the names of all the field agents, which has become a complete surprise for the acting agent (unfortunately, Kevin Eldon played in the film only an episodic role).
This turned out to be the last drop for the Prime Minister – a proud person who has already suffered devastating criticism and is in deep depression due to the loss of popularity (Emma Thompson tried to best convey his image, inspired by Theresa May, but did not give up the script).
Intelligence advisers informed her that all active agents were compromised, and she needed to attract someone from the retired.
The choice falls on the clumsy Johnny English, who now works as a teacher in some super-fashionable institution and unofficially teaches children undercover operative work (in this part of the spy "school of the year" English for teenagers was several successful jokes).
The Englishman is quickly taken to Whitehall for an emergency briefing, where he reunites with his long-suffering friend Baf, who is once again played by Ben Miller.
Buff is now married to the captain of the submarine (the role of an exasperated annoying person does not quite match the talent of Wiki Pepperdine).
So, when everything in the Secret Service of Her Majesty is gone, "Batman and Robin" return to the line and unexpectedly meet the fatal woman Ofelia Pistoletova, played by Olga Kurilenko.
And at this time, the prime minister falls under the spell of a charismatic billionaire who has earned his fortune in the field of technology and claims that he can fix the problem with the British network – the sinister Jason Volt, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Buff go on a trip and again resort to their ridiculous tricks: dressed as waiters they make a fire in a chic French restaurant; then they sow chaos, illegally going out of the house to go abroad on a luxury yacht Volta; English in
All the stops lead us to the last episode, but with his benevolence and madness, he is somewhat like a movie for children.
A passing film.
As with watching other Johnny English films, I asked myself the same question: can the British film industry not offer Rowena Atkinson a role that really fits his talent?
Labour denies a plan that would allow Britons to work four days a week, but would receive a five-day salary.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is due to discuss a radical plan under which the British will work four days a week, but will receive a salary in five days.
It is reported that the party wants to oblige the heads of companies to transfer the funds saved as a result of the revolution of artificial intelligence to employees, giving them an additional weekend.
Thus, workers will have a three-day weekend and at the same time will bring home the same salary.
According to the sources, this idea will correspond to the economic program of the party and directs the resources of the country in support of the working class.
The transition to a four-day working week was approved at the British Congress of Trade Unions. It is seen that in this way workers will be able to benefit from a change in the general economic situation.
A Labour source told The Sunday Times: “A policy review will be announced at the end of the year.
Everything will not change overnight, but the idea of a four-day working week corresponds to the approach of the party to change the balance of the economy in the interests of the workers, as well as to the general industrial strategy of the party.
Labour was not the first to endorse the idea, as the Green Party promised to introduce a four-day working week during the 2017 election campaign.
However, not all members of the Labour Party at the moment approve of such a desire.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The party's political agenda does not provide for a four-day working week, so we are not considering this idea right now."
"Shadow" Chancellor John McDonnell presented his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy at the Labour Party's pre-election congress last week.
Mr. McDonnell said he was prepared to take back power from “uncounted directors” of utilities and “explorers.”
The Chancellor’s “shadow” plan also means that shareholders of water supply companies may not get their full share of capital if the Labour government imposes “deductions” on the basis of imaginary violations.
He also confirmed his intentions to include workers in the board of directors of companies and create inclusive equity funds to transfer 10% of the ordinary shares of private sector firms to workers who expect annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsay Graham and John F. Kennedy talk on 60 Minutes about whether the FBI’s investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
In connection with the investigation of the charges against Justice Brett Kavanaugh, which is led by the FBI, the final vote for his appointment as a Supreme Court judge has been postponed for at least a week. The question arises whether Republican senators will continue to support Kavanaugh's results after the April release.
On Sunday’s 60 Minutes show, Scott Pelli asked Republican senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find something that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
During the hearings, I said that I had a conversation with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after everything happened and the accusation came out, and I asked him, “Did you really do this?”
He was determined, unwavering, uncompromising.”
It seems that Graham's opinion will not change anything.
“I think Kavanaugh’s accusations are a provocation,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied everything,” Graham added, addressing Christine Blaise Ford.
And anyone she calls can't confirm it under oath.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don’t know what can change.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and how can it affect poverty reduction?
On Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual event in the music world with an astonishing number of star performers and no less daunting mission – to overcome poverty worldwide.
During the seventh Global Citizen Festival tens of thousands of people will flock to the Great Grasslands of Central Park, not only to enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to draw attention to the real goal of the festival – organizers want to overcome the 20th century.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international public organization that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket for an event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors must complete a number of tasks or "actions", such as taking a volunteer project, writing an email to the world leader, making a phone call or anything else to help get the attention.
So are there any results already, because to achieve the goal organizers Global Citizen has 12 years left?
Is the idea of rewarding for doing a free concert really a brilliant way to convince people to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called “cliticism” when people feel that they are really changing something by signing an e-petition or posting on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011, they have recorded 19 million “acts” of their supporters aimed at achieving different goals.
The organization says these actions have prompted world leaders to announce planned financial allocations and programs worth more than $37 billion, which by 2030 will help change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited as an example of the results of its activities 390 financial commitments and public statements, with at least 10 billion already collected and spent.
According to the group, the funds provided have already directly affected the lives of approximately 649 million people worldwide.
Among the main financial obligations, we can mention the fund The Power of Nutrition00, which is territorially related to the United Kingdom. As part of the project, investors and marketers have taken on a commitment "to help children grow better" and promised to provide more than $ 47 million to help Rwanda.
“With the support of the UK government, sponsors, governments of other countries and citizens of the world like you, we can make the social problem of malnutrition a trivial fact of history,” said The Power of Nutrition spokeswoman Tracy Ullman, speaking to the public during a live concert in London in May 2018.
The organization also said that after 5,000 "actions" calling for improved nutrition for mothers and children, the UK government announced funding for The Power of Nutrition project aimed at improving the nutrition of 5 million mothers and children.
In response to one of the common questions on his website, "Why do you think you can overcome extreme poverty?",
Representatives of Global Citizen wrote: "This is a long and difficult road, so sometimes we will fall and we will fail.
However, like the participants in the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed because together we are stronger.”
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Giannell Mona are just some of the star performers who will perform at this year’s New York festival, and will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Ferness and Guy Jackman.
The interior minister said that the United States can use the naval forces for a "blockade" to prevent the export of Russian energy resources
According to a quote from U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke, quoted in the Washington Examiner, “if necessary,” Washington may seek help from the naval forces to prevent Russian energy from entering markets, including the Middle East.
Zinke said Russia’s involvement in the conflict in Syria, especially where it acts at the invitation of a legitimate government, is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I believe they are in the Middle East because they want to become a middleman in energy trading, as they are already doing in Eastern and Southern Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve the problem.
"Thanks to the naval forces, the United States can ensure free passage by sea and, if necessary, block them so that Russian energy resources do not enter the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event, which was held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that positions itself as the “voice of every consumer” in the United States.
He then compared the approaches to trade with Russia and Iran, noting that they are in fact similar.
“The economic strategy with regard to Iran and Russia in general is that we are using energy resources effectively and replacing them with alternatives,” he said, calling Russia “unilaterally developed” as its economy depends on energy sources of mineral origin.
While these statements were being made, the Trump administration set a goal to increase exports of compressed natural gas to Europe, pushing energy carriers of Russian origin out of the market, a much cheaper option for Europeans.
To do this, Trump administration officials and President Donald Trump himself are trying to persuade the German government to abandon the "inappropriate" project to build the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, will make Berlin a hostage to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which is worth 11 billion dollars and which will double the capacity of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington is fiercely opposed to the project only for economic reasons, which is an example of unfair competition.
"In my opinion, we share the view that energy resources cannot be a tool of pressure and the consumer should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position provoked a negative reaction from Germany, which confirmed its support for the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI), has called on the US not to interfere in the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I don't like it when a third country interferes in our energy supplies," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federal Association of German Industry, after German Chancellor Angela Merkel's last meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren 'seriously thinks' of 2020 presidential bid
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would “seriously think” about running for president after the midterm elections.
During a meeting with the public in Goliok, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering the possibility of running for office.
According to The Hill, Warren said: "It's time for women to go to Washington and set up government work, and for it to be led by a woman."
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president.”
During a meeting with the public, Warren expressed her appreciation of the presidency of Donald Trump, saying that he "leads his country in the wrong direction.
“I’m extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was outspoken in criticizing Trump and his proposed candidacy for the position of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren wrote: “...undoubtedly, the FBI should conduct an investigation before the vote.”
However, according to a poll released on Friday, the majority of Warren voters do not believe she should run in 2020.
According to a poll jointly conducted by the University of Suffolk’s Center for Political Studies and The Boston Globe, 58 percent of Massachusetts’ potential voters opposed the senator’s candidacy.
Thirty-two percent supported the promotion.
The results of the poll showed that the former governor Deval Patrick enjoys more support. For his potential promotion to the post of President expressed 38%, against – 48%.
While discussing the candidacy of other well-known Democrats who may run in 2020, they also called former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont State Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make a decision by January.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Track Palin during rally in support of Donald Trump
26-year-old Track Palin spent a year in Iraq after entering military service in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence, and the incident took place on Monday night.
“What my son is going through right now, what he is going through after his return, can only be understood by other families who are experiencing the consequences of PTSD and other health problems that our soldiers are coming home with,” she told a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa.
Palin called Trek's arrest "a problem that no one pays attention to" and said her son and other war veterans "are returning home not as they used to be, more brutal, and want to know whether the other soldiers are respecting what their fellow soldiers have done here."
According to the spokesman of the city's police department, Dan Bennett, Treka was arrested on Monday in the town of Vasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, as well as the fact that he prevented the reporting of a child abuse.
18 States and District of Columbia Support Appeals for Asylum Policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support appeals against the new U.S. policy of refusing to grant refugee status to victims of gang persecution and domestic violence.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and the district sent an analytical note from a court adviser to Washington to support a plaintiff who needs asylum and appealed the policy.
The full name of the plaintiff in the case of "Grace v. Sessions" under the suit of the American Civil Rights Union, in which the federal policy is challenged and which was filed in August, is not disclosed.
The plaintiff said her partner "and his cruel sons-bandits" beat her, but U.S. officials refused her when she asked for asylum on July 20.
She was illegally detained in Texas.
Prosecutors who support Grace’s lawsuit said residents of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala (refugees who often seek asylum in the U.S.) often face serious problems such as banditry and domestic violence.
The new policy of granting refugee status cancels the 2014 decision of the Board of Appeal on immigration, according to which undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence could apply for asylum.
Attorney General General Carl Reisin said in a speech Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires that decisions on applications for refugee status be based on consideration of the facts and circumstances set out in such a statement, and the prohibition violates this principle," the court's advisory note reads.
Prosecutors argue that a policy that bans immigrants from entering the U.S. hurts the country’s economy because they could potentially become entrepreneurs and “replace the necessary labor resources.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued an order to immigration judges that said they could no longer grant refugee status to those fleeing domestic violence and banditry.
"Asylum is granted to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of persecution in connection with race, religion, nationality, membership in certain public groups or political views," Sessions said in a statement.
Providing asylum has never had the goal of solving all the troubles, even those serious problems that people around the world face every day.
Rescuers are desperately trying to find the survivors, while the death toll in Palu has doubled.
For those who have survived, the situation continues to worsen.
"The situation is very tense," says the 35-year-old mother, reassuring her boy with a fever in the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palu.
"Each minute an ambulance brings in the bodies.
“Clean water is not enough.”
Some residents return to their shattered homes, overhauling their flooded possessions, trying to save what they have found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged as a result of the earthquake, the strength of which was 7.5 points on the Richter scale, were overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including Two Geris with a fractured back and shoulder, rest near the Palu Army Hospital building, where patients are assisted in the open air due to constant repetitive pushes.
His eyes were filled with tears as he remembered how a strong push shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time for rescue.
I feel like I’m stuck in the middle of a wall,” Geris told an Associated Press correspondent, adding that he and his family had come to the city for the wedding.
"I heard my wife begging for help, and then there was silence.
I don’t know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of “Making Psychological Pressure” Through “Advertising That Contains Propaganda”
A week after a state-run Chinese newspaper published four pages of U.S. daily advertising material about the mutual benefit of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily’s paid app in the Des Moines Register, Iowa’s most popular newspaper after accusing China of trying to influence the November 6 congressional elections. China rejects these accusations.
Officials in the U.S. told Reuters that Trump’s statements, in which he accuses Beijing of trying to interfere in the U.S. election, signify a new phase of escalation by Washington, whose goal is to put pressure on China.
While foreign governments may place ads to intensify trade, there is an escalating trade war between Beijing and Washington over time, in which they have already raised import tariffs.
According to experts from China and the United States, at the beginning of this war, the imposition of a repressive tariff in China was intended to strike exporters from states such as Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump.
Terry Brenstead, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, the largest exporter of agricultural products to China, said China had harmed American workers, farmers and companies.
China, as Brenstead wrote in the Sunday issue of the Des Moines Register, "intensifies the pressure by publishing propaganda advertising in our independent press."
“To spread propaganda, the Chinese government is using the tradition of freedom of speech and press independence for the American people by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Brenstead wrote.
"In contrast, on the street layouts here, in Beijing, you will find only individual voices of dissenters. Here you will not see a true reflection of what the Chinese people really think about the direction of development of the Chinese economy, which is a cause for concern for China.
He also added that "one of the honorable Chinese publications offered to publish" his article, but did not name which one.
Analysts warn that the failure of Kavanaugh Republicans set up against themselves women voters before the midterm elections
With many prominent Republicans supporting and defending Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh after he has been charged with several sexual misconduct charges, analysts warn it could trigger an unwelcome reaction ahead of the upcoming midterm elections.
Passions are rampant around this situation, and most Republicans publicly state that they would like to go to the polls.
Such things cannot then be simply played back,” Grant Rieger, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, told The Hill in an interview published on Saturday.
Riger expressed doubts that the FBI investigation, which Senator Jeff Fleck (an Arizona Republican) began insisting at the last minute, would be enough to calm angry voters.
As reported by Washington, D.C., the chief adviser and spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, Catherine Jean-Perrier, said on Friday: "Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it either tomorrow or in November."
According to Mic, on Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is approaching!" during a demonstration at the Legal Committee when Republicans decided to move to approving Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blaise Ford.
In an interview with the news website, Steve Rotenberg, a non-partisan political reviewer, said: “People will be extremely interested and motivated.”
“They say that’s the case now, and it’s true.
However, the motivation may be heightened, especially among female voters aged 18-29 in the suburbs, who are not yet determined and often do not vote if they do not like the president.
Even before Ford gave testimony in connection with the Supreme Court’s sex crime candidate’s allegations, analysts predicted a negative voter reaction if Republicans insisted on approving.
According to NBC News, earlier this week, former Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele said: “This is an unpleasant story for the Republican Party.”
In an interview with the news channel, the director of Priorities USA (a group that helps the Democrats in the election campaign) Guy Cecil, "it's not about the committee voting, the final vote or the fact that Kavanaugh was on the bench of the defendants, and how they got on the bench of the defendants, and how they got on the bench of the defendants.
However, the opinions of the Americans about whose testimony to believe, Ford or Kavanaugh, have been divided. A little more support Ford.
According to a new YouGov survey, 41% of respondents believe or rather believe Ford’s testimonials, while 35% of respondents believe or rather believe Kavanaugh’s testimonials.
In addition, 38% of respondents said that, in their opinion, Kavanaugh gave or most likely gave false testimony, while about 30% of respondents said the same about Ford.
According to The Guardian, after the insistence of Fleck, the FBI conducts a review of the charges brought by Ford and another plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford testified under oath to the Senate Legal Committee about how Kavanaugh attacked her while she was intoxicated when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez stated that the candidate for the post of judge of the Supreme Court showed her their genitals at a party during their studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Internet Inventor Plans to Launch ‘New Internet’ to Create Competition between Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global Internet, launches a new startup to create competition from Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is developing an open source platform Solid, the idea of which belongs to Berners-Lee.
With the Solid platform, users will be able to choose where to store data and who to give access to this or that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal of Inrupt was “world domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid technology, which will allow users to create a "personal online data store" or POD.
It can store contact lists, current affairs lists, calendar, audio library and other tools for your own use and work.
It’s like using Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify in one browser at the same time.
A unique feature of this personal online data repository is that it fully meets the needs of the user who can access any information.
The company calls it “expanding personal capabilities with data.”
According to Inrupt CEO John Bruce, the company aims to leverage resources, processes and relevant skills to make the Solid platform accessible to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired from IBM, several staffed developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own standalone applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not in talks with Facebook and Google about whether to make a full replacement when all of their business models undergo radical changes in a short period of time.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a Saturday post on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission is “to provide commercial energy and ecosystems and to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network created on the basis of the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential figure in the debate over net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remained the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, The Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
“I am very optimistic about the next era of network development,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration on the occasion of the handover to the representative of the Church of the Order of the Cross of Victoria in the years of the First World War
The only representative of the Anglican Church who received the Order of the Cross of Victoria for his participation in hostilities during the First World War is honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt. Col. Rev. Bernard Vann received an award for his participation in the attack under Bellangis and Leocure on September 29, 1918.
However, he was killed by a sniper bullet four days later and never knew he had received Britain’s highest military award.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren unearthed a memorial stone during a parade in the town of Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vanne, called it "extremely symbolic" that the discovery of the memorial stone took place exactly 100 years after his grandfather performed the feat for which he received the award.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt. Col. Vann moved his battalion through the Saint-Cathen Canal "through a very thick fog and under the dense fire of field guns and machine guns".
Later, he hurried to the edge of the fire and with "desperate courage" led the line forward, before which one broke into the field gun and destroyed three guns of the enemy unit.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanna was shot dead by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
The 72-year-old Michael Vann said his grandfather had done something he himself would never have been able to repeat and that he deserved to be respected.
He and his brother Dr. James Vann put on the wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vanne said he was "very proud to be part of this parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero demonstrates the respect that so many people show him."
MMA fans did not sleep all night to watch the Bellator 206 tournament, but instead showed them "Pepp's Pig"
Imagine that you don’t sleep all night just to watch the event-saturated Bellator 206 tournament, and you’re denied the opportunity to review the main event.
The posters of the tournament, which was held in San Jose, indicated 13 fights, including six matches of the main program, which were broadcast live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just before Gegard Musashi and Rory McDonald were preparing to get together in a duel, viewers in the UK were stunned when Peppa's pig appeared on the screen instead of broadcasting the fight.
Some viewers were not thrilled by this, as they did not sleep until the morning, waiting for the battle.
One of the fans wrote on Twitter that the switch to a children's cartoon seemed to him "some sort of unsuccessful joke".
"According to the government's order, the content broadcast at 6 a.m. was inappropriate, so they were forced to play a children's show," said Dave Schwarz, senior vice president of marketing and public relations at Bellator, when asked about the show.
"Pepp's Pig, yes."
Bellator President Scott Cocker has promised to work on the schedule of broadcasts to reach viewers in the UK in the future.
“I think if we talk about the replay of the broadcast, then we can fix it,” Cocker said.
“But now it’s Sunday, 6 a.m., and we can’t do anything until we have Sunday, and they have Monday.
However, we are working on it.
Believe me, when the broadcast was turned off, we received a lot of messages that we responded to, and the text of those messages was not very friendly.
We thought it was a technical problem, and we tried to fix it.
However, it turned out that this was not in line with government regulations.
I can promise you that this will not happen again.
We will reduce the tournament to five battles instead of six as usual. We have tried to redirect the signal to the fans, but so far we have postponed these attempts.
It's a really unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “worse” than others because of his sexual orientation
Olympic water jumper Tom Daly says that he grew up feeling worse than others because of his sexual orientation, but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete said he did not realize that "not everyone is like him" until he went to high school.
Participating in the Desert Island Discs broadcast on Radio 4, led by Lauren Laverne, he noted that he was frankly speaking about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also stated that due to paternity began to worry less about winning the Olympic Games.
The host, Kirsty Young, who has been running the program for a long time, went to the hospital for several months.
Coming as a pariah on Laverne's first show, Dale said he felt "worse" than others as a child because "society did not perceive when someone liked boys and girls."
He said: “Until then, the feeling of inferiority and difference was precisely what gave me the strength and the strength to succeed.”
According to him, he wanted to prove that something was “worth” not to disappoint all those who finally learned about his orientation.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became a well-known fighter for LGBT rights and used his appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He stated that he was frank about his views, as he felt happy that he could live openly without any consequences, and wanted to give that "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion admitted that feeling for his husband, American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, was a real surprise for him.
Dale married an Oscar winner, 20 years his senior, last year, but he said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you're going through so much at such a young age" (at the first Olympic Games he performed at the age of 14, and three years later his father died of cancer), it's hard to find someone of his age who would also have survived such ups and downs.
In June, the couple had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and since then, according to Daley, his "worldview" has changed.
“If you had asked me last year, I’d only think about what gold should be,” he said.
“You know, there are things that are much more important than Olympic gold medals.
“My Olympic gold is Robbie.”
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father could not accept the thought of the end and before his death asked if they had bought tickets to the London 2012 Olympics because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You’re not going to sit in the front row, because you’re not going to be around anymore,’” Dale said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was only after he actually stopped breathing and died that I finally realized that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I knew that's what I've been dreaming of my whole life: diving in front of my compatriots at the Olympics, and there was no better feeling than that," Dale said.
This feeling also inspired him to choose his first song – Proud (Proud) performed by Heather Small – which resonated with him in preparation for the Olympic Games and still evokes ants.
The Desert Island Discs programme will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15am UK summer time.
On Saturday from the match of the tournament for the "Rider Cup" brought out Michelson, who was not in shape
The American Phil Mikkelson will set a record on Sunday by playing his 47th game in the tournament for the "Rider Cup", but he has to restore the form so that this event does not become unfortunate for him.
Mikkelson, who for the record 12th time participates in the tournament, which takes place once every two years, was removed from the game by Captain Jim Furyk for the time of the forecourts and forecourts.
Instead of being at the center of events, as he often did, playing for the United States, the five-time winner encouraged the team all day long and trained aside, hoping to master the emotions.
Since Mikkelson was not famous for hits even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old athlete was not quite suited for the challenging Le Golf National golf course, where the raf usually punishes for wandering hits.
And if the field is not so much an obstacle, in the ninth match on Sunday Michelson will have to meet with the champion of the Open Championship and master of the exact strike Francesco Molinari, who, in pair with the newcomer Tommy Fleetwood won all his matches this week.
If the Americans, who are three points behind after 12 singles matches, start well, Michelson’s match may be decisive.
Furik expressed confidence in his athlete, and, probably, besides that, he had nothing to add.
“He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has no doubts about his abilities.
Michaelson is a Hall of Fame member who has done so much for teams last week and this week.
I didn’t expect him to play in two games.
I predicted more matches, but that’s how it turned out, so we decided to do it.
He wants to be there, on the field, just like anyone else.”
If Mikkelson enters the field on Saturday, he will break the record of Nick Faldo, who played the most matches in the "Rider Cup" tournament.
On this, he may end his career in the "Rider's Cup" tournament, which never corresponded to his individual achievement.
At Michelson's account, 18 wins, 20 defeats and 7 draws, but Furick said his presence could play a crucial role for the team.
“He’s funny, edible, witty, he likes to joke with others, he’s a guy who’s great to have on the team,” Furyk explained.
"I think the younger players had a lot of fun coming up on him and this week, and it was interesting to watch.
He’s more than just a player.”
The captain of the European team Thomas Björn knows that the big break does not solve anything
Thomas Björn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the noticeable gap before the singles matches of the last day of the tournament for the "Rider Cup" does not yet guarantee victory.
The Dutchman made his debut in 1997 in a game at Walderram, where the team led by Sev Ballesteros overtook the Americans by five points, but won the game with a minor break with a score of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2:131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You remind yourself that we had a big gap in the game on the Valderrama field; a big gap in Brooklyn where we lost, and a big gap in the Valderrama field where we won badly,” Bjorn said after reviewing the winning Class 2018 games with a score of 5:3 on Friday, Thursday and Thursday.
So history teaches me and every player on the team that nothing has been decided yet.
Tomorrow we have to play with the maximum return.
Go out into the field and do whatever it takes.
The game will be completed only after the result appears on the board.
We have a goal – to win this trophy, and that’s what we want.
“As I said before, I focus on the 12 players on our team, but we know who is against us – the best players in the world.”
Satisfied with the performance of his players on the challenging field, Björn added: "I will never run ahead.
Tomorrow, everything could be different.
We’re going to have individual matches tomorrow, and that’s something else.
It’s great to play on the field with a partner when things are going well, but it’s just when you’re standing there alone, and you can check what you’re worth as a golfer.
Here's how to set up players to perform tomorrow: on the verge of opportunity.
You leave your partner without support and now he has to show what he is capable of.”
Unlike Bjorn, opposite number Jim Furyk expects his partners to play better on an individual level, except for Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Until Furik's fate returned on the last day in different directions: he was among the winners in Brooklyn, but was defeated when the team from Europe created the Miracle in Medina.
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to a question about how Ben Cranshaw, the team's captain in 1999, organized the players before the final day of the game.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we need to start successfully, as it was in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the initiative moves to someone else's side, players in the middle of the distance are under special pressure.
"We've appropriately placed the players on the team, as if we're going to do something incredible tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the counterattack in the top match against Rory McKillroy. Next in the first half of the European team's list were Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Paulter.
“It is these partners that I chose in this order because I want to distribute my efforts evenly throughout the game,” Björn commented on his choice of players for individual matches.
The commissioning of a new German battleship has been postponed again
The most modern frigate of the German navy was supposed to be put into operation in 2014 instead of outdated warships during the Cold War. However, according to local media, this will not happen until at least next year due to faulty systems and rapid increase in costs.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, received from the spokesman of the military department, the commissioning of the ship "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main vessel of the series of the most modern frigates of the "Baden-Württemberg" class, has been postponed until the first half of 2019.
This ship was due to join the rest of the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery hindered the implementation of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the naval department in 2007 are to replace the outdated Bremen-class frigates.
It is clear that they will be equipped with a powerful gun, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some technologies for reducing visibility, in particular, radar, infrared and acoustic.
Another important feature is a longer maintenance period. It is expected that the new frigates will not be able to return to the base port for about two years.
However, Die Zeit warns that due to constant delays, state-of-the-art warships, which were supposed to boost Germany’s military capacity at sea, will also become obsolete at the time of commissioning.
The much-suffering F125 frigate hit the headlines last year when Germany’s naval forces officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm + Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first case of the return of the warship to the shipbuilding company after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media mentioned significant “software and equipment defects” that made the warship unfit for military operations.
The software flaws are of particular importance, as the crew of the Baden-Württemberg-class ship consists of about 120 sailors – this is only half of the number of soldiers who served on the old Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it turned out that the ship has a significant excess weight, which worsens its operational characteristics and limits the possibility for further modernization.
The Rheinland-Pfalz frigate is believed to be twice as heavy (7,000 tons) as ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the faulty equipment, another problem was the total cost of the project, which also includes the cost of training the crew.
The expected <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion turned into a colossal <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (US$3.6 billion).
Problems with obtaining new frigates have gained special weight in light of recent warnings about the decline of Germany’s naval forces.
At the beginning of the year, German Armed Forces Commissioner Hans-Peter Bartels said that the country’s navy “remained short of ships fit for combat tasks.”
The official said that the situation deteriorated rapidly over a period of time, as the old ships were decommissioned and the new ones did not arrive.
He expressed deep regret that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates were able to replenish the navy.
The National Trust will observe the secret life of bats
A new study, which is being conducted on land in the Scottish Highlands, aims to establish how bats use the landscape in search of food.
Scientists hope that the obtained data will help shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals in order to take measures to preserve them in the future.
In the gardens of Inver in Western Ross, scientists of the National Trust of Scotland will observe such species as the dwarf netopyr and the pygmy netopyr, as well as the ears of the common and watery nightingale.
Special registrars will be placed in strategic locations on the land to observe the behavior of bats during the season.
Employees and volunteers of the National Trust of Scotland will also conduct mobile research using manual detectors.
Expert analysis of all recorded sounds will help to determine the frequency and belonging of bat screams.
It is then planned to develop a detailed map of the animals' habitat and prepare a report to link the behavior of the animals to their habitat.
Rob Dewar, a conservation adviser at Scotland’s National Trust, hopes the findings will help determine which habitats are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to assess the effectiveness of environmental care measures (e.g. meadow formation) and identify optimal forest conservation methods for bats and other related species.
Over the past century, bat populations have declined significantly in Scotland and the United Kingdom.
They are threatened by active construction and development of territories, which deprives them of nesting places.
Other negative factors include wind installations and lighting, glue paper for flies, chemical processing of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
They are not actually blind.
However, because of hunting at night, the ears are more effective in helping them catch prey than the eyes.
They use a complex echolocation technique to detect insects and obstacles in the flight path.
Scotland’s National Trust, which has more than 270 historic buildings, 38 special-purpose gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bat problems very seriously.
Ten specially trained experts regularly conduct research, inspections of nesting sites and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organization’s efforts even created the first and only bat reserve in Scotland. It is located on the territory of the Trivets site in the Dumfries and Galloway area. Eight of the ten species of bats that live in Scotland have been found there.
David Thompson, the manager of the premises, says that this is the perfect place for them.
"On the territory of the site Triv excellent conditions for bats," he assures.
"There are old buildings, many giant trees and other favorable living conditions.
However, we still need to learn a lot about bats. Thanks to the research we are doing here and elsewhere, we will be able to learn more about what they need for prosperity."
He insists that it is very important to check the territory for bats before carrying out any technical work, because the unintentional destruction of one nesting place for breeding young can kill up to 400 females with infants, which is likely to cause the destruction of the entire local popu.
Dogs and their nests are protected by law. Animals are forbidden to kill, torture or disturb.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an officer at the Scottish Flea Conservation Centre, called on the public to join the organization's efforts.
She said: "We still need to know a lot about our bats. We have not yet revealed the characteristic features of the populations of many species."
Ronaldo rejects rape charges, and his lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against the German edition
Cristiano Ronaldo called the allegations of rape "blind" and said people were "trying to get attention" using his name.
His lawyers are ready to file a lawsuit against the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published information about the suspicions.
The American Catherine Mayorga accused the Portuguese national team forward and football club Juventus of rape, which occurred in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to Der Spiegel magazine on Friday, Ronaldo allegedly paid her $375,000 for silence.
A few hours after the accusations were made, 33-year-old Ronaldo appealed to 142 million of his fans in a video broadcast on Instagram, calling the corresponding messages "blind".
"No, no, no, no, no!
Today’s accusations are slanderous,” the five-time Golden Ball owner made a statement on camera.
“They want to draw attention to themselves by using my name.
It's natural.
These people are trying to get hold of me, but situations like this are part of my job.
I’m a happy person and I’m fine,” added the footballer, smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the published charges, which they called “an unacceptable report of suspicion in the field of privacy.”
Attorney Christian Shertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral harm to the extent of the seriousness of the violation, which is likely to be one of the most noisy cases of personal rights violations in recent years."
It is alleged that the incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
It is reported that after the meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal. Such testimony has been transferred to the Clark County District Court (Nevada).
Mayorga claims that after the incident described, Ronaldo fell on his knees and said that he was a "99 percent good guy" who was "one percent".
As stated in the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that he had sex with the model, but with mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that she turned to the police and then to the hospital where her injuries were photographed. However, she later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she was "afraid of revenge" and warned of "public humiliation".
Now the 34-year-old woman is seeking to cancel the previous agreement, as she continues to suffer from an incident that she says took place.
At the time of the incident, Ronaldo was preparing to move to Real Madrid from Manchester United. This summer he became a player of the Italian football giant, the Juventus team, for 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain will 'permanently regret' the loss of automakers
The UK will "forever regret" if it loses its status as the world leader in the automotive sector after Brexit. This is warned by Economy Minister Greg Clark.
He added that he was concerned by the statement of Toyota UK representatives, who told BBC journalists that in the event of Britain's withdrawal from the EU without a deal, the company would be forced to suspend production and operation of its plant in Bernaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” said Minister Clarke.
The Japanese automaker said the consequences of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The factory in Bernaston, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis cars, produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will be stopped," said Marvin Cook, Toyota's general manager at Bernaston.
Other automakers, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are also concerned about how Britain’s exit from the EU without a deal on international trade will affect.
For example, BMW said that the production plant for the Mini in Oxford will be closed a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of automakers are related to the fact that a no-deal Brexit could pose risks to supply chains.
Toyota’s production line operates in an expeditious delivery of parts and materials as needed – parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be disruptions in the supply of parts at the border, resulting in delays and a shortage of materials.
As noted in the company, the Toyota warehouse can place parts for no more than one day. So production will have to stop.
Greg Clarke noted that the EU’s Chequers Plan, which was prepared by Theresa May, “separately provides for schemes to avoid problems at the border.”
“We need an agreement. We need to make an optimal agreement, which, in my opinion, will allow us not only to succeed at the present moment, but also to take advantage of the prospects that have arisen,” he said during the Today program on BBC Radio 4.
“Given the testimony of Toyota and other automakers, we urgently need to maintain high-efficiency supply chains.”
Toyota has not been able to tell how long production will be halted, but in the long run, it is expected that the increase in costs will lead to a decrease in the competitiveness of the plant and, as a result, will cause jobs to be reduced.
Peter Tsuvalaris, chairman of the Unite trade union organizing committee at the factory in Bernaston, who has worked here for 24 years, said that other participants were extremely concerned: "From experience, I can say that cut jobs are not being restored."
A government official said: "We have put forward a precise and reliable plan for shaping our future relations with the EU."
Trump and Rosenstein meeting could be postponed again, says White House
White House officials said Sunday that Donald Trump’s meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed for another week” as discussions continue over Brett Kavanaugh’s candidacy for the Supreme Court.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia’s interference in the election, ties between Trump’s aides and Russia, and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
For several months, Washington has been discussing the possibility of the deputy attorney general's dismissal, which would jeopardize Mueller's independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke about the use of microphones to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of early termination of the president's powers under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein did not confirm this information.
But last Monday, he visited the White House amid reports that the official is going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he "wouldn't" want to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was later postponed to avoid a timely coincidence with a Senate Legal Committee meeting where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Forrester B.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, which further deferred a vote in the Senate.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: "The date of the meeting is not set. Perhaps it will take place this week. I expect it to be postponed for another week, given all the events related to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see. I keep an eye on the press for the latest information."
Some journalists disagreed: Sanders has not briefed the media at the White House since September 10.
Lead Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the infrequent briefings were not related to the hostility of "play in public" by television reporters, although she added: "I will not deny that they are playing in public".
Then she assumed that Trump himself would communicate with the press more.
"The president answers questions more often than any president before him," she said, citing the source, adding: "Statistics speak for themselves."
Sanders said the briefings would still be held, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask a question to the president of the United States, it's better than talking to me."
We try to communicate with the press often. This should be especially noticeable in the last few weeks. The opportunity to talk to the US president is no worse than a press conference."
Trump regularly answers questions during events outside the White House, open meetings or press conferences attended by high-ranking guests.
Personal press conferences are seldom held.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why this is the case, behaving in a distraught and sometimes awkward manner in front of journalists.
Scotland's Secretary of State for Health addressed a letter to EU workers over concerns over Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health has addressed a letter to citizens of other EU countries working at the Scottish National Health Service to express gratitude for their work and ask to continue it after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already made a commitment to cover the cost of applications for permanent resettlement status for EU citizens working in autonomous public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman noted: "Negotiations between the UK and the EU on the issue of exit have been ongoing over the summer.
But the UK government is stepping up preparations for a possible no-deal exit.
I know that this period can be very disturbing for you.
That is why I would like to emphasize once again how I value the contribution of every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the European Union and beyond share valuable experience and skills, strengthening and improving the health service for the benefit of the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home. We really want you to stay.”
Cristion Ebercromby underwent emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers midfielder Cristion Ebercromby underwent an emergency operation after suffering a head injury in a Sunday match against Vanderbilt Comodores, which his team lost with a 31:27 count. Tennesse journalist reported this.
The head coach of the Tennessee State Tigers told reporters that the player was injured shortly before the break.
"He approached the sideline where he got sick," Reed said.
On the sideline, coaches and medical staff gave Ebercromby oxygen before taking it off the stretcher for further examination.
The official representative of the Tennessee State Tigers team told Chris Harris of the WSMV channel (Nashville, Tennessee) that Ebercromby had been operated on at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no evidence yet of the type and severity of the injury." The Tennessee State Tigers team is trying to find out when the player was injured.
Ebercromby, a second-year student, spent his first season at the Tennessee State Tigers after leaving the Illinois team.
He made five interceptions of the ball on Sunday before leaving the game. Thus, for the season he has 18 interceptions.
Foreign buyers will pay more state duty in case of purchase of real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will pay more duty in case of purchase of real estate in the UK. According to the new plans Tori additional funds will be spent on help the homeless
This event neutralizes all attempts by Corbyn to attract young voters
Higher state duty will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance hopes to attract an additional <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year to help the homeless
As announced today by Theresa May, foreigners buying real estate in the UK will pay more duty. Additional funds will be spent on helping the homeless.
This move can be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing targeted at high-paid workers.
The increase in duty will apply to individuals and legal entities who do not pay taxes in the UK. Additional funds are directed by the government to help those who are forced to spend the night in the open air.
The additional duty, which is accompanied by an increase of two years old for second housing and real estate intended for rent, can be three percent.
The Ministry of Finance is expected to attract an additional <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
According to experts, 13% of the new property, which is being built in London, is owned by foreign citizens. This leads to higher prices and complicates the task for those who only dream about their own housing.
Many wealthy areas of the country, particularly in the capital, are devastated, as a large number of foreign buyers most of the time live outside the country.
The new action plan came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in state tariffs to make housing more affordable for young people.
He accused major construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by buying land without its further use. He urged Theresa May to abandon quotas on affordable real estate to correct the "disgraceful housing market situation" in the UK.
Mr. Corbyn announced a number of important real estate reforms, including rent control and the impossibility of eviction without good reason.
It also proposes to expand the powers of local councils in the field of construction of new housing.
Theresa May said: “Last year I promised that I would dedicate my premiere to restoring the British dream – for every new generation of life to be better.
This requires a change in our imperfect housing market.
The UK will always remain open to those who want to live, work and build their future here.
However, it cannot be called fair that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, buy housing on the same terms as British citizens.
For too many people the dream of own housing has become unattainable. The problem of living in the open air is still very painful".
Jack Ross: “I want to be the head coach of Scotland”
Jack Ross, head coach of Sunderland, says he is “above all” to ever lead the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old Scotsman has resumed the club from the north-east of the country, which now holds third place in the First Football League, three points behind the leader.
Ross moved to the Stadium of Light this summer, returning last season of FC St Mirren to the Premier League of Scotland.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I got to the second Scotland national team, but that was the end of it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound programme.
"When I was a kid, my father and I often watched the Scottish national team play at Hampshire Park, which has always fascinated me.
The only hope for me remains to be successful as the club’s head coach.”
Ross' predecessors at Sunderland were Dick Lawyer, David Moes, Sam Ellardys, Martin O'Neill, Roy Kean, Gustavo Poet, and Paolo Di Canio.
Former head coach of Alloa Athletic claims that he did not feel the excitement of moving to a big club followed by such authoritative names, previously rejecting offers from FC Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At this stage, I will think that I have achieved success if the club returns to the Premier League.
Due to its structure and material and technical support, this club, without a doubt, corresponds to the level of the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not going to be an easy task, but the other result I’m unlikely to consider successful for myself.”
Ross has only been building a coaching career for three years. Before that, he worked as a second coach at FC Dumbarton, and also spent 15 months at the coaching staff of FC Harts.
He then helped Alloa to recover after FC got to the third division, and the following season from St. Mirren went the way from the stage of departure to winning the title of the winners of the first division.
According to Ross, he now feels more comfortable than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Folkerk, St. Myrren and Hamilton Academical.
“I was at the crossroads,” he recalls, talking about the transition to FC Alloa.
“I honestly believed that the coaching activity was more suited to me than the game.
It sounds strange because I was successful, not bad at earning and reached certain heights.
But playing is not easy.
There are a lot of difficulties that have to be overcome every week.
I still face them, experiencing stress and tension, but in the role of the head coach I feel in my place.
I have always been interested in coaching. I have never felt so comfortable in my adult life as after choosing this profession."

Study: 17:30 on Sundays – the perfect time for a cup of beer
The summer heat helped increase revenue for British pubs, which are experiencing not the best times, but increased the pressure on the restaurant chain.
According to calculations, sales in pubs and bars rose by 2.7% in July, while restaurant profits fell by 4.8%.
The author of calculations Peter Martin from the organization CGA, which is engaged in consulting on business development, noted: "Due to the sunny weather and longer than expected, the participation of England in the World Championships, July has passed by the same rate of 2, <0xD0><0xBF><0xD0><0xB8><0xD1><0x80><0xD0><0xBE><0xD1><0x81><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xB0>.
The June drop of 1.8% in July intensified.
Pubs and bars focused on serving drinks, so far have the best indicators – the growth of their profits is equivalent to the loss of restaurants.
Pubs that serve food were also hit by the heat, but not as badly as restaurants.
It seems that visitors are only interested in drinking.
In controlled pubs and bars, sales of beverages increased by 6.6% for the month. At the same time, sales of food decreased by 3%".
Paul Newman, RSM’s Permit and Hospitality Analyst, said: “We’ve been seeing similar trends since the end of April.
Weather and large-scale social or sporting events remain the main factors influencing sales in the domestic market.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to lose profits. The annual drop in sales by 4.8% causes special concern against the background of the need to reduce costs.
The long hot summer has not come at the best time for food-serving establishments. We will see if the milder temperatures that we observed in August will be able to give them such a necessary rest."
Overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new establishments, amounted to 2.7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in the launch of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales volume indicator in the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector is a reflection of the collected and analyzed performance indicators of 47 working groups, whose total turnover exceeds <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion. This is a commonly accepted industry standard.
One in five children has a hidden social media account from their parents.
According to the results of the study, one in five children, sometimes under the age of 11, have a social media account hidden from parents and teachers.
A study of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fictitious pages on Instagram
This news has heightened concerns about the possible placement of sexual content
20% of students reported having a “main account” that they show to parents
One in five children, sometimes under the age of 11, create an account on social networks that hides from adults.
The study, which covered 20,000 high school students, showed an increase in the number of fake pages on Instagram – a social network for sharing photos.
This news has heightened concerns about the possible placement of sexual content.
20% of students reported having a clean “core” account that they show to parents, as well as one or more private ones.
The mother, who accidentally stumbled upon the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter, saw there the cry "rape me."
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in private schools found that 40% of children aged 11 to 18 have two social media profiles. Half of these children admitted that the additional account is secret.
Mike Buchanan, head of the HMC Association, said: "We are very concerned that many teenagers feel the desire to create an online space in which parents and teachers will not be able to find them."
Eilid Doyle to be ‘representative of athletes’ interests’ on Scottish Athletics Council
Eilid Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics board as an independent director during the annual general meeting of the board members.
Doyle is Scotland’s most successful athlete. The chairman of the board, Ian Beatty, called this step a great opportunity for those who lead the sports movement to take advantage of its extensive experience gained internationally over the last decade.
“Eylid has great respect among athletes in Scotland, the UK and the world. We are confident that by bringing her to the board, athletics in Scotland will benefit immensely,” said Beatty.
Doyle said: "I will be inspired to act as a representative of the interests of athletes. I hope that I will really be able to bring benefits and contribute to the development of sport in Scotland".
An American, a four-time Olympic champion who won the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games, and now a sports spectator for the BBC, lost the opportunity to walk through a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I can recover and how much.
Thanks to incredible efforts, I managed to fully recover. I learned to walk again and today I am doing dynamic exercises!
Thank you for your words of support!"
In the advertising of the milk sucker women compared with cows – the opinions of Internet users were divided
The manufacturer of milk-absorbers faced an ambiguous reaction of Internet users to advertisements in which young mothers are compared to active cows.
To mark the release of the product, dubbed "the world's first silent desktop milk extractor", consumer technology company Elvie has released a humorous music video-style ad to demonstrate the freedom that the new vacuum cleaner provides for mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a haystack under a song that says, "Yes, I feed myself, but I don't have a tail," and "As you can see, it's not meme, it's my breasts."
Then the choir sings: "Suck, suck, to feed the children. Suck, suck, so that the milk is not wasted".
However, an ad posted on the company’s Facebook page caused a turbulent online discussion.
The video received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments. However, the reaction of Internet users turned out to be ambiguous. Many noted that the advertising underestimated the "terrible organization" of milk production in the industry.
"It's not a very smart decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to give milk. However, their children are taken away from them a few days after birth,” – wrote one of the users.
The Elvie milk sucker can be easily hidden in the feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Here’s another comment: “Of course it’s traumatic for both the mother and the child.
But why not attract them to advertise a milk-sucker for women who need to feed their babies?"
Another added: "This advertisement is very far from reality."
Other users defended the commercial. One of the women's videos seemed "very funny".
“I think it’s a genius idea.
I would definitely buy such a thing if I was still breastfeeding.
As I was sucking milk, I felt like a cow.
Advertising is a bit crazy, but I wasn’t looking for hidden content in it.
“A great product,” someone wrote.
Here’s another comment: “A funny advertisement aimed at moms who suck milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
This advertisement is not aimed at highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the women demonstrate the milk suckers hidden in their bras.
The concept of an advertising campaign is based on information that many women who use similar products feel like cows.
However, the Elvie vacuum cleaner works perfectly quietly, has no wires or tubes and easily hides in a feeding bra. Thanks to this, women can move freely, keep children and even go out.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director of Mother, commented: “The Elvie vacuum cleaner is such a revolutionary product that it required a bright and provocative presentation.
Having drawn a parallel between women milking milk and real cows, we wanted to draw attention to the features of breastfeeding, in an exciting and interesting way demonstrating the incredible sense of freedom that the new sucker will bring.
The Elvie suction cup is not the first time in the news headlines.
As part of London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the podium with this product during a show of clothes from fashion designer Marta Yakubovska.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent site on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the Trump administration’s harsh rhetoric and policies have complicated the process of placing children in caregivers.
Traditionally, in most cases, the guardians were the immigrants themselves without documents. Now they are afraid to jeopardize their own opportunity to stay in the country, offering to take responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their households would be required to provide fingerprints and that this data would be passed on to immigration services.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior official at the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that dozens of people who applied for unaccompanied minors’ care were arrested by the Bureau’s staff.
The Bureau later confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no criminal record.
“About 80% of people who are carers or members of their households are in the country illegally. Many of them are foreigners who have committed offences.
Therefore, we continue to persecute these individuals,” Mr. Albens said.
According to asylum workers, in order to deal more quickly with the cases of children, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of the children to appear in court within a month of their detention, rather than 60 days, as was previously the case.
Many of them will be able to use video conferencing instead of coming to court in person to prove their legal status before immigration judges.
Those who do not have the right to asylum by a court decision will be deported quickly.
According to the asylum workers and official data from the responsible officials in recent months, the longer the children remain in custody, the greater the likelihood that they will experience anxiety or depression. This can cause outbreaks of violence or attempts to escape.
Human rights defenders argue that these problems are exacerbated in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where it is more difficult to monitor the psychological state of children.
They added that by moving children to a tent site and not giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to friends, we risk intensifying the trauma that many of them have already experienced.
Syria ordered the "occupation forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw troops immediately
In addition, speaking before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war has been going on in the country for the eighth year.
Mualem, who also works as the deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil under the guise of fighting terrorism, so "the treatment of them will be appropriate."
"They should leave immediately and not put conditions," he said at the assembly.
Mualem insisted that “the war on terrorism is actually over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions of people have left their homes.
He said Damascus would continue “this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories” of terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The U.S. has deployed about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
In the war-torn country, France sent more than 1,000 soldiers.
As for the refugees, Mualem assured that the country had created proper conditions for their return. He also accused "some Western countries" of spreading "unreasonable fears" through which the refugees do not dare to return.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help people come back,” he said.
“We are seeing efforts to politicize a purely humanitarian problem.”
The U.S. and the European Union have warned that they will not assist Syria in rebuilding the country until a political agreement has been reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone around Idlib, the last major stronghold of the insurgents, has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
Thanks to the Russo-Turkish agreement, it was possible to prevent a large-scale offensive by the Russian-backed Syrian forces into the province, where three million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action will be directed against jihadists, including al-Qaeda-linked militants of the al-Nusra Front, who "will be destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committee, which will include representatives of the government and the opposition, in the near future to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and create the conditions for elections.
Mualem put forward conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying his work should be limited to "revising the articles of the current constitution", and warned of interference.
Why Trump will be re-elected
According to this logic, Trump could be re-elected in 2020 if, as is likely to be expected by many liberal viewers, he does not resign early after the scandal and impeachment.
Without a doubt, this would be the “most dramatic end to the presidency of all time”!
At the moment, viewers are not showing signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of prime time viewers has more than doubled (up to 1.05 million) on CNN and actually tripled (up to 1.6 million) on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averaged 2.4 million viewers in prime time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and The Rachel Maddow Show on the MSNBC cable channel peaked at the top of the rating with 3.5 million viewers on the evening when the main news is discussed.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s beyond our comprehension,” said Neil Burr, executive producer of ABC’s Last Candidate drama about the secretary of state who becomes president after the devastating attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scowell, an experienced humorist writer and author of "Only Funny Moments: As well as a Few Strict Truths About Penetrating the Hollywood Men's Club" offers another theory.
She recalled a trip in a Boston taxi before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
"Because he's making fun of me," he said. That's the story Mrs. Scowell told me.
Chaos is fun.

External Inflows in the Toughest Interim Elections to Congress
Not surprisingly, in Pennsylvania’s 17th District, additional cash inflows are directed, because due to a revision of the constituency boundaries, two current congressmen are fighting for one seat.
A Democrat, a member of the House of Representatives Connor Lamb, who won another district in last spring's by-elections, enters the fight for this suburban district of Pittsburgh, whose borders have recently been changed.
Lemb opposes another current congressman, Republican Keith Rothfs, who now represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, whose borders largely coincide with the new 17th.
The maps were reworked after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old boundaries of the districts were drawn in favor of Republicans in violation of the constitution.
Pre-election races in the new 17th arrondissement sparked fierce opposition between major party financial units, the U.S. Democratic Party Committee on Congressional Elections (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Party (NRCC).
Lemba's name became well-known in Pennsylvania after a win with a minimal advantage in the 18th district during the March by-elections to Congress, which enjoyed widespread public attention.
This place belonged to the Republicans for more than a decade. President Donald Trump won this district with a 20-point advantage.
Political experts have given a slight preference to the Democrats.
The US considered the possibility of punishing El Salvador with the support of China, but changed its mind
Diplomats recalled Washington’s weak resistance to the actions of the Dominican Republic and Panama, which had previously supported Beijing’s position.
In June 2017, Trump held a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela. Earlier, Trump also had a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the staff hired by the Trump Organization.
State Department officials have decided to recall heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over “recent decisions to deny Taiwan recognition,” Department of State spokeswoman Heather Neuert said earlier this month.
But the sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, particularly in the area of drug control, as well as in support of social and economic development.
The proposed fines, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for this Central American country with its high levels of unemployment and murders.
According to the results of internal meetings, officials from the states of North and Central America postponed the conference at a high level dedicated to security and economic prosperity. A similar event took place last year, and it was seen as a step forward in efforts aimed at restraining the flow of U.S. migrans.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place. In fact, on this consideration of the issue of sanctions against El Salvador ceased.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pence now plans to speak at a conference scheduled for mid-October, in a sign that the administration considers this event to be very important.
At the same time, the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, because there were no new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
Mr. Bolton’s representative in the White House declined to comment on the details of the internal discussions reported by three U.S. officials, two of whom are diplomats, on condition of anonymity.
The information provided by them was confirmed by a third-party analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on terms of anonymity.

The next inconvenience could be a report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on a possible obstruction of justice by Trump, an important confirmation of why it can be found in the public information available now.
As part of his investigation, Mueller is reportedly examining the possible link between the Trump campaign and the Russian attack on our voting system.
If the influence in Congress passes into other hands, Trump will have to report to Congressmen, as well as to voters and, ultimately, one-partyers.
There is a lot of “if” in this case, and I don’t want to say that the fall of Trump is inevitable, like his colleagues in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic have to make a choice that will determine the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup d'état against Hitler if only the West began to resist him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have failed and lost the opportunity to avoid bloodshed.
The course of history is determined by such turning points, and the unstoppable movement of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
There are a number of such twisted myths waiting for Americans now.
What will we do if Trump sacks Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man on whom Mr. Mueller’s fate depends?
Rosenstein got into trouble even as the newspaper reported that last year he offered to secretly record conversations with the president and shared his thoughts on Trump’s inconsistency with the office.
Rosenstein called the information in The Times inaccurate.
“How will we react if the investigation into Brett Kavanaugh, which the FBI has recently launched, is not thorough enough or honest enough, or if Kavanaugh’s candidacy for the Supreme Court is approved despite compelling allegations of sexual harassment and sexual misconduct?”
And, first of all, will we vote in the medium term for those members of Congress who will be able to hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these trials, there will be bad times for democracy.
But I believe that we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jewish woman who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light Saturday candles on a table with a swastika.
With such an inheritance, can I not look to the future with optimism?”

Gram Dorrance with "Rangers" with optimism awaits a meeting with the Vienna "Rapid"
FC Rangers will host Rapid (Vienna) on Thursday. After an impressive draw in Spain in a game with Villarreal earlier this month, the victory over the Austrians will provide the Scottish club with good chances to leave Group G of the Europa League.
Due to knee injury, midfielder Graham Dorrance was able to play for his team for the first time in the season only in a match with Villarreal, which ended with a 2:2 score. However, he believes that FC Rangers can use this result as a springboard to achieve more.
"For us, it was a good result, because Villarreal is a strong team," the 31-year-old said.
"We came out with the hope of getting something and got one point.
Maybe at the end of the game we could go ahead, but in general, nothing can probably be considered a fair result.
In the first half the opponent was better, but after the break we corrected the situation in our favor.
On Thursday, there will be another major clash in the Europa League.
I hope we can get three points, but it will not be easy. Our future rivals showed a good result in their last game. However, we can count on the support of the fans. I am sure that we will be able to give a fight and get a positive result.
Last year was certainly difficult, starting with my injuries and ending with the changes in the club itself. But now the situation has normalized.
We have a great team and all the guys are happy. The training is going well.
I hope we can go further, leave last season behind and be successful.”
Women lose sleep over fear of retirement savings <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they would like to organize care for themselves, few spoke about it with their family members.
About half of the people who participated in the Nationwide study said they had talked to their husband or wife about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% of respondents talked about it with children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they’re not in a hurry to start a conversation about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here’s what you need to start with.
Talk to your husband or wife and children: your family will not be able to provide you with the necessary care unless you inform your relatives of your wishes in advance.
Consult with your counselor and family to determine where and how to get care, as this choice can become an important factor in determining the cost.
Engage a financial advisor: he can advise on how to cover the corresponding costs.
Funding sources for long-term care include a traditional insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy, or self-assurance at the expense of your own funds (provided you have the money).
Carefully prepare legal documents: this will allow you to avoid legal cumbersomeness in advance.
Prepare a credential for your representative, who will supervise your medical care and ensure that specialists fulfill your wishes in case you are unable to do it in person.
In addition, we advise to issue an authorization to dispose of cash.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and pay the bills in case of your incapacity.
Do not forget about minor details. Imagine that one of your elderly parents needs urgent medical care, so he is taken to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down this information to be ready.
“It’s not just about finances. It’s important who the doctors are,” Martin says.
What medications can be taken and
Who will take care of the dog?
Prepare such a plan.”
In Ilfracombe, a man shot several times with a pneumatic rifle
The man fired several shots from a pneumatic rifle when he returned home from a party.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
Officers described the shooting, which took place at 2:30 a.m. during British summer time, as "random".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His wounds are not life-threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, state authorities said, but the number could rise.
Due to the outage, officials involved in humanitarian aid issues cannot obtain any information from the Dongala regency, a district north of Palu, which is located closer to the epicentre of the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
After the disaster, 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
We will give some basic facts about the city of Palu and the Dongala regency located on the island of Sulawesi.
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 according to data for 2017.
When there was an earthquake that caused the tsunami, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regency that stretches for more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
According to data for 2017, about 299,200 people live in the regency, an administrative region located in the lower part of the province.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main economic sectors of the Central Sulawesi Province, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian disaster mitigation agency, Palu and Dongala have suffered from the tsunami several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people died as a result of the Dongala tsunami and hundreds of homes were destroyed.
In 1996, the tsunami also covered the western part of Dongala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismicly active Pacific Ring of Fire and regularly suffers from earthquakes.
Below are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.
2004: On December 26, a powerful earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Achegh province, located in northern Sumatra, caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of whom were in the province of Achaea.
2005: At the end of March, in early April, a series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake rocked southern Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake rocked one of the Mentawai islands near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake hit the Regency of Pidjia in Aceh Province, causing destruction and panic due to the fact that people have not yet had time to forget the devastating earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died under the debris of buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed many homes, and thousands of tourists could not immediately leave the island.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
The track of Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
According to an Alaska state police report published on Saturday, 29-year-old Palin from Vasily, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and charged with obstructing the reporting of a case of violence and resisting for a while.
According to a police report, when a woman he knew tried to call the police to report possible crimes, he picked up her phone.
According to KTUU, Palin is in custody in the Matanuska-Susitna detention centre with the right to make a security deposit of $500.
He stood before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "innocent" when asked if he admits his guilt, reports the network.
Palin has been charged with three Class A offences, including arrest for up to one year and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with class B offences, punishable by a day of imprisonment and a $2,000 fine.
It is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported a possible attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, as well as the fact that he obstructed the reporting of a domestic violence incident and carried a weapon in a state of alcoholic intoxication when the incident occurred.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans for justifying her son’s brutal behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder after serving in Iraq.
In Indonesia, an earthquake caused a tsunami: hundreds of people died
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 caused a tsunami and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Communication and power grids are out of order, and the number of victims may increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near the center of the island of Sulawesi, located in the northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
The video, which is distributed on social networks, shows the moment when the element hit.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal Prosecutors Call for Rare Death Penalty for Suspect in New York City Terrorist Attack
In New York, federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty for Saifullo Saipov, a suspect in the New York terror attack that killed eight people - a rare punishment that has not been used in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
In October, a 30-year-old Saipov, driving a Home Depot pickup truck, reportedly took a bike path along a highway in West Side, Lower Manhattan, and began shooting down cyclists and pedestrians who happened to be on his way.
According to a report of intent to execute, filed in the Southern District of the state of New York to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight people and “intentionally” caused serious bodily harm.
According to court records, each of these indictments provides for the possibility of the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Court of Juries brought 22 charges against Saipov, including eight counts of murder for the purpose of demanding, which usually federal prosecutors raise in cases involving offenses of organized crime, as well as charges.
According to the prosecutors, who described Saipov's crime as "atrocious, cruel and malicious", this attack is the result of "reliable planning and thoughtful thinking".
The victims who Saifula Habibullahevich Saipov injured, injured or killed were Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Ann-Laura Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Hernan Ferruc.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since the last time a criminal case, punishable by the death penalty, was filed in the Southern District of New York.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug suppliers, and was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty in a federal case was carried out in New York in 1953, the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not show any reproach of conscience in the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he did not regret the crime.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out an attack on an ISIS video that he watched on his phone.
Police say he also asked to hang the flag of ISIS in his hospital room.
He did not plead guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "very disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting guilt and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of being released will only exacerbate the psychological trauma caused by these events to all the victims," Patton said.
Saipov’s defense party has also previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A member of parliament from the Conservative Party believes that the FARAJA MEP should be appointed responsible for the negotiations on Brexit
Today, during a protest at the Congress of the Conservative Party, Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army".
The former leader of the UK's Independence Party said politicians should "feel the pressure" of Eurosceptics as one of the MPs, Theresa May, offered her candidacy for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bowen said at a march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would "already come out" if Mr Farage was Brexit secretary.
The attention to the problems that May faced in trying to reconcile her deeply divided ranks was even more attracted by the fact that MPs from the Conservative Party, who are opposed to the exit, joined a special protest in the city against Brexit.
The prime minister is trying hard to implement the Chequers compromise plan, despite attacks from Brexit supporters, those opposed to the exit, and the EU.
The Allies insist that it will not abandon attempts to negotiate with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and will force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between what it proposes and “chaos.”
At the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull, Mr. Bowen said he wanted to "reject Chequers".
He invited Mr Farage to step out of the shadows and take responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was responsible for this, we would have come out already,” he said.
MEP Wellingtonborough added: “I will support Brexit, but we have to give up Chequers.”
Speaking against the EU, he said: “We fought in world wars not to submit.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bowen rejected the assumption that after the 2016 vote, public opinion changed: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and do not want to leave is absolutely not true."
Conservative Party member and Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins, who was also on the march, told reporters: “I’m just saying, ‘Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is not supported by our party and our activists, who are actually walking the streets and fighting for the votes of the voters.
Please drop the Chequers and start listening.”
In an address to Theresa May, she added: "The prime ministers retain their office when they keep their promises."
Mr Faraj said politicians should “feel pressure” if they are going to renounce the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a question of trust between us, the people and our political elite,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to say it won’t get out of their hands.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want our political elite, which plans to betray the idea of Brexit, to feel the pressure.
We are mobilizing this country’s people’s army that will lead us to victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, opponents of the exit passed through Birmingham, and then held a two-hour rally in the city center.
Several activists waved “Conservatives against Brexit” banners after the group launched this weekend.
Labour’s Lord Adonis ridiculed the Conservatives because of security concerns following the opening of the conference because of their party program.
“These are people who tell us that they can use the IT systems and technologies necessary for Canada-plus, a well-organized border, free trade with Ireland,” he said.
“This is a complete farce.
There is nothing good about Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to "seriously think" about running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "seriously consider running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that during a general meeting in West Massachusetts on Saturday, a representative of the Democratic Party from Massachusetts spoke about her future.
Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, is running for a second term in November against Republican Party member Jeff Dill, who co-chaired Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It is considered to be the main candidate who can fight Trump in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon, she held her 36th meeting with voters in the format of a general meeting since Trump took office.
The participant asked her if she planned to participate in the presidential elections.
Warren said: "It's time for women to go to Washington and set up government work, and for that, a woman should be at the head of it."
The suspect in the murder of the firearms basketball player "LSU Tigers" Sims was arrested
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police said on Saturday they had arrested LSU Tigers basketball player Weid Sims, a suspected gunman, on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dieton Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m.
On Friday, they released a video of the shooting asking to help identify the person on it.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot dead near the University of Southern campus on Friday morning.
"Weid Sims sustained a gunshot wound to the head and was killed as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday.
Wade gave in to his friend, and Simpson shot him.
As a result of the interrogation, it was found that Simpson was at the scene of the crime, had a gun with him, and shot Wade Sims.
The Simpsons were arrested without incident and taken into custody in the East Batton County Police Department.
Sims, whose height was 6 feet and 6 inches and who played in the junior league, grew up in Baton Rouge. He played 32 games with 10 stars last season and spent an average of 17.4 minutes per game on the field, scoring 5.6 points and 2.9 points.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton cut back in the fight for the world title after the team made the decision to give him a victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since Valtteri Bottas left Lewis Hamilton behind on Saturday, it has become clear that Mercedes’ team decisions will play a significant role in the race.
Bottas started well from the pole position and almost bypassed Hamilton, who tried to maintain his position in the first two laps and gave Vettel the opportunity to attack his teammate.
Vettel went to the pit stop first and left Hamilton on the track in the tail of the race, which was to solve everything.
The driver of the Mercedes team drove another lap and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton broke into the leaders after a certain maneuver by the wheel to the wheel, as a result of which the driver of Ferrari reluctantly left the interior space due to the risk that he was squeezed in the front, after the treachery in the result of a double.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstappen started from the back row of the grid and remained in seventh place until the end of the first round.
Sweat he led most of the race, as he did not change the tires to quickly come to the finish and move Kimi Rykkonen from fourth place.
As a result, he stopped at the pit stop on the 44th lap, but was unable to increase the pace on the last eight, thanks to which Rykkonen took fourth place.
“It’s a tough day because Valtteri taught full-time on all weekends and showed nobility when he gave me the opportunity to drive.
The team has done exceptional work to take first and second place," Hamilton said.
The body language was not impressed.
At a rally on Saturday, President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diane Feinstein for her firm stance in not disclosing the contents of a letter from Christine Blaise Ford, who accuses Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
While speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not address directly the testimony given by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead expressed his opinion on events in the Senate that, he said, demonstrated human "subtleness, disgust."
“The only thing that could happen, and all the great things that’s been happening in the last few days in the Senate, is anger, you see evil people demonstrating avarice, disgust and lies,” he said.
“You look at the publications and the information that’s being released, and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
It's not me."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you disclose the information?
Remember her answer... Did you disclose the contents of the documents? – “What?
Oh, no.
I didn't disclose."
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
No, we didn’t,” he added, copying the Senator’s behavior.
In July, Feinstein received a letter detailing the allegations made by Ford against Kavanaugh, and in early September, its contents were made public, but Feinstein denied that the leak had occurred in her office.
"I did not conceal Dr. Ford's accusations, I did not disclose the information received from her," Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep it a secret, and I didn’t break my promise.”
However, her denial seems to have disliked the president, who commented during the Saturday rally: "I'll tell you, her body language was not at all impressive.
She may not have done it, but I haven’t seen anyone get worse.”
Continuing to defend a Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual assault by three women, the president suggested the Democrats were using the accusation for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power in any necessary way.
You see the avarice, the disgust, they don’t care who to offend, who to go through to gain power and control,” Mediaite quoted the president as saying.
Elite League: "Dandy Stars" - "Belfast Giants", 5:3
The Giants player Patrick Dwyer threw two wasps in the match against Dandy
The Dandy Stars were rehabilitated after a Friday defeat in the elite league from the Belfast Giants, winning a 5:3 match-response on Saturday.
The Giants got an early lead in two wasps thanks to pitches by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bovilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Coney equalized the score in the home game, and then Dwayer again brought the Giants forward.
Dandy player Francois Bushard equalized the score, and two goals from Lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured their victory.
This is the third defeat of Adam Keefe's team in the elite league season, which won a 2-1 victory over Dandy on Friday night in Belfast.
This is the fourth team meeting of the season. Three previous matches were won by the team of the Giants.
Dwyer threw the first disc in the fourth minute (3:35) after the transfer of Kendall McFall, and four minutes later Bovilier, who received the disc from David Rutherford, doubled the score.
After a tense first period in the fourteenth minute (13:10), Sullivan returned the field owners to the game, and in the sixteenth minute (15:16) Coney, having received a washer from Matt Markward, equalized the score.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before the first break, throwing his second washer at the end of the first period.
The masters of the field regrouped, and Bushar in the twenty-eighth minute (27:37) leveled the score again, throwing the washer when his team prevailed numerically.
Thanks to the efforts of Coney and Charles Corcoran, Nielsen brought Dandi forward for the first time at the end of the second period and secured the victory of his team in the fifth half of the last period.
On Friday, the Giants, who have already lost four of the last five games, will play a starting match against Milton Keynes.
Air traffic controller died so that hundreds of people on the plane could avoid an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia has been declared a hero after he helped take off a plane with hundreds of people at the cost of his own life.
More than 800 people were killed and many missing in the aftermath of the tsunami on Sulawesi Island on Friday.
Strong underground shocks continue to shake this area, many people found themselves under the rubble in the city of Palu.
However, unlike his colleagues who fled to save his life, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in the highly dispersed control tower at the Mutiara SIS Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained in place to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was safely taken into the air.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Indonesia’s air navigation service provider, Johannes Sirajt, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian news agency ABC News.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, which is to deliver it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“We are very sorry to hear about this,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of victims could reach thousands, as the country's disaster mitigation agency says access to the cities of Dongala, Sighi and Butong is limited.
"The number of victims could increase as many bodies are still under the wreckage, and many of them cannot be reached," said the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
The waves, which reached six meters high, devastated the city of Palu, where mass burials will be held on Sunday.
Military and passenger planes deliver aid and food supplies.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Each minute ambulance brings bodies.
Clean water is not enough.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere.”
The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Indonesia, Jan Gelfand, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help people who have survived this tragedy, but we do not know what they will find there.
It’s a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Vidodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country’s military: “I ask all of you to work day and night to carry out all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?”, CNN reported.
Earlier this year, Indonesia suffered from earthquakes on the island of Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
A plane crash in Micronesia: as stated in Air Niugini, after the plane crashed into the lagoon one person disappeared
The airline, which operated a flight that crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, now claims that one person was missing, although it was previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane that sank.
Air Niugini said it was unable to find a single passenger on Saturday.
The airline reports that its representatives are trying to find the man and for this they cooperate with local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to a request to provide more detailed information about the passenger, for example, his age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water as it tried to land at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were left in hospital on Saturday, and all of them were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses believe that the plane flew over the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane was flying very low above the ground.
"That's very good," said Janes.
Janes said that he and the others managed to get to the emergency exits on a thin plane while being on the belt in the water.
He told me that the stewardess was panicking and screaming, and that he had a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors working close to modernizing the dock also helped in the rescue operation, bringing people ashore by inflatable boat before the plane sank at a depth of 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, over the past two decades, 111 people have died in plane crashes related to PNG-registered airlines, but this list does not include Air Niugini.
The analyst restored the chronology of the night in which the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the indictment filed a case against a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified as an expert in operational development for several hours.
He told the jury how he used cell phone recordings to recreate the movement of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of the murder.
Rowlett, according to The Clarion Ledger, said he had obtained location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contradicting his previous claim.
When the data showed that his cell phone was near Chambers, although he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to the latter.
On Saturday, Sanford testified and stated that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s pickup that night, Sanford said he was “lieing because my pickup was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers about two weeks before her death.
Recordings of telephone conversations indicated that they had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," Gail said.
The defense has to make its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge expects the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
The trio of hip-hop performers want to challenge the negative view of the genre, filling their music with constructive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol argues that hip-hop has changed its nature – it has abandoned political ideas and struggles to solve social problems.
They want to go back to the origins and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently witnessed the revival of this direction in the UK thanks to bands such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another dark one?!
In New York, a nanny sued a couple for dismissal, receiving a "racist" message
In New York, the nanny sued the couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving an incorrectly addressed message from a mother complaining that she was "another black woman".
The couple denies that they are racists, comparing the lawsuit to "demand."
Linsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed concern when she saw that her new babysitter, Giselle Morris, who arrived on her first working day in 2016, was a black man.
“No, there’s one more dark side,” Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she twice sent it to Miss Morris.
According to the New York Post, realizing her mistake, Mrs. Plaxon-Flaxman felt "uncomfortable" and fired Ms. Morris. She stated that their former babysitter, who was an African-American, was doing her job poorly and that she was expecting a babysitter from F.
Miss Morris was paid for a day’s work and then sent home on Uber.
Now, Morris is suing the couple, hoping to get compensation for her dismissal in the amount of a salary she would have received in six months of working with the spouse she was originally hired for, albeit without a contract. She was to be paid $350 a day.
“I want to show them that it’s not necessary to do that,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
In response to allegations that they were racist, the couple said the release of Morris was a sensible decision because they feared they would not be able to trust her after being insulted.
"My wife didn't mean what she sent her.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you leave your children with a person you treated rudely, even if it wasn’t intentional?
Your own baby?
NARRATOR".
Comparing the lawsuit to "demanding," Plasco said his wife had given birth to a child only two months ago and had "not yet recovered."
“Would you take revenge on someone after that?”
This is a bad act,” the investment banker added.
While the trial is still ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media, criticizing their behavior and logic.
According to a new letter, Padington’s publishers feared that readers would not understand the idea with a bear who is able to speak.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born almost immediately after they agreed to print the book, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it was published.
Now it’s funny, because we know about the huge success of the Paddington story.”
Talking about her father, who worked as a BBC operator, before a small toy bear inspired him to write a children's book, she was optimistic that his work was rejected, she shared, as on the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book, and at the same time felt.
Regarding Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family", Karen added that her father was quietly proud that the book had become so popular.
“He was a pretty humble man and didn’t like to brag,” she said.
"But Paddington was as real to him as his own child! After all, when children achieve something, we are proud of them, although it is not theirs, not our victories.
I think he looked at Paddington's success that way.
Although Paddington is a creation of his imagination, he has always attributed success to him.
My daughter died, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was taken to the 2nd Louis Pasteur hospital in Nice, where doctors unsuccessfully tried to save her life.
“I was on the phone regularly, saying that everything was really bad, that she shouldn’t have done it,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz.
“And then Nad called me and told me that she would die in the next two minutes and I should say goodbye to her.
And I did it.
I said, "Tashi, honey, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I will be with you.”
The medications that doctors gave her to keep her heart beating gradually stopped working and left the body.
She died some time before everything was shut down.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing what was going on at this time.
I couldn’t grieve, scream or cry because I was surrounded by family and people.
I really should have kept myself in my hands.”
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, grieving over the loss of her daughter, sat on the plane with the other passengers, not paying attention to the severe trials she had to endure.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I lowered my head and couldn’t hold back my tears.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I began to deeply sympathize with Nada.
He needed my love and support.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Two women who suffered grief leave postcards to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide work to prevent others from putting their hands on themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys leave postcards on the Welsh bridge with phone numbers that people can call for support, as well as messages that would inspire them.
Miss Davis Tyler's son was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18 he put his hands on himself.
“I don’t want other parents to feel the same way I do every day,” she said.
45-year-old Miss Davis, who lives in Leeds, said her son was a promising chef with an attractive smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that this smile made any room brighter.”
But he quit his job before he died because he was “like in the dark.”
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old brother found his brother’s body after he laid hands on himself.
Miss Davis says, "I'm constantly afraid it's going to have consequences."
Miss Davis created postcards "so that people know there are those they can turn to and talk to, even if they're just friends.
“Don’t shut yourself up, you need to talk.”
Ms. Humphreys, who has been friends with Ms. Davis for many years, lost her husband, Mark, with whom she lived for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say that he felt depressed, that he had depression or something,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed that it had changed.”
And on Christmas Day, he finally fainted, and when the children opened their presents, he didn’t look them in the eye or anything.”
She said that his death was a huge trauma for them, but they have to survive it: "It imposed a devastating

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance: FBI begins investigation
“I thought that if we could get what we asked for – limited in time and the nature of the investigation – we might have reached some agreement,” Mr. Fleck said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would “disintegrate” against the backdrop of a deadly loss of loyalty to the political party.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their unwillingness is related to time.
The midterm elections will take place in just five weeks, on November 6. If Republicans are expected to have problems, it will seriously complicate their attempts to conduct their own person in the country's Supreme Court through elections.
George W. Bush called the senators asking to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House under Mr. Bush and through which he met his wife Ashley, who worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI prepares its report?
In the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting, the vote will take place.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes at a Senate meeting, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to resolve the problem with the same number of votes and approve his candidacy for the position of a Supreme Court judge.
During Kim's rule, the number of North Korean migrants "decreased"
After Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the number of migrants from North Korea to South Korea has declined, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Pyongyang, citing data from the Ministry of Unification of the Republic of South Korea, said that last year the number of runners was 1,127 compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Pak said that the key factors were increased border control between North Korea and China, as well as the fact that smugglers who transport illegals now demand more money for it.
In Pyongyang refrained from public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean runners are finally offering South Korean citizenship.
Seoul said more than 30,000 North Koreans had crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea. It is easier to cross than a well-protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China sees migrants as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still formally at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang and discussed issues of denuclearization, negotiations on which have stalled.
This came after the June historic meeting of U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they broadly agreed to cooperate on nuclear disarmament on the Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yoon-ho accused the United States of lack of progress since the sanctions were adopted.
“Without trust in the United States, we cannot be sure of the security of our country, so there can be no talk of unilateral disarmament under these circumstances,” Mr. Ri Yoon-Ho said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's not fit to work in the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the minority in the House of Representatives, called the candidate for the post of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was not temperamentally fit for work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi expressed her thoughts in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I kept thinking that if a woman ever acted this way, she would be called ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi commented on her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied accusations of sexual assault against Dr. Christine Blaise Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his introductory speech, Kavanaugh behaved very emotionally, sometimes almost screaming and coughing, discussing his family and school years.
He also openly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the accusations against him "absurd and coordinated reputational destruction" organized by liberals who were outraged by the fact that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
According to Pelosi, Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court, as it showed his biased attitude towards the Democrats.
"I think with these statements, as well as his speech against Clinton and the Democrats, he will personally withdraw his candidacy," she said.
Pelosi was outraged when asked if she would attempt to declare Kavanaugh impeachment if his guilt was confirmed, and whether Democrats would receive a majority in the House of Representatives.
“If he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, it’s not just for the Supreme Court, it’s for the court where he’s working now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently serving as a judge in the U.S. Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the Row v. Weid case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
At his hearings on the issue of approval of the position of Kavanaugh, the party asked whether he would overturn some decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time when the judge becomes a hysterical, biased person and we will say how wonderful it is," Pelosi said.
Women need to have these weapons.
These are just words that contained months and years of anger, and she could not pronounce them without tears.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Ms. Stein told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, are you?"
She continued: "One woman, who worked as an executive and helped me a lot, said that she also cried when she was angry, but she had her own technique. When she got angry and started crying, she said to the interlocutor, 'You can think I'm sad and that's why I'm crying.
I am evil.”
And after that, she just kept going.
I thought it was unbelievable.”
Tears are considered an acceptable way out of anger in part because they are perceived differently.
One of my clearest memories of my first job in the office, where mostly men worked, was a situation when I once cried from inexpressible anger, and an older woman – an unwelcome manager, whom I always had a little fear of – grabbed me by the collar and pulled me to the floor.
“Never let them see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They’ll think you’re sad, and they’ll be glad they got to you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Garth was caught on an extramarital affair aboard a boat called Monkey Business, after which he left the race, deeply frustrated Miss Schroeder decided that there was no reason why she could not run for president.
“It wasn’t a very thoughtful decision,” she told me with a laugh 30 years later.
“Seven other candidates have already taken part in the race, and another candidate is the last thing they needed.”
Someone called the situation “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
Since it was at the end of the campaign, she was lagging behind in fundraising, so she vowed not to participate in the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a hopeless struggle.
She found that some of her supporters, who did not regret the support of men of $ 1,000, gave her only $250.
“Do they think they’ll give me a discount?” she wondered.
When she gave a speech and announced that she would not carry out an official campaign, she was gripped by emotions – gratitude to the people who supported her, disappointment with the system, which made it very difficult to raise money and forced her to focus not so much on the voters as on the members of the Chamber of Deputies, as well as anger about sex.
“You would think I had a nervous breakdown,” recalls Miss Schröder’s reaction to the press.
You would think that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I was still thinking about what they were going to write on my gravestone?
“She was crying?”
How a U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
Experts believe that the first steps in the trade war between the US and China have been desperate, and, although far before its conclusion, in the long run the split between the countries could benefit Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump made the first warning shots earlier this year, taxing major Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The situation worsened this week due to new tariffs on goods worth a total of $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), which actually tax half of all goods coming to the US from China.
Beijing paid back the same coin each time, recently imposing a tariff of five to ten percent on U.S. goods worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to take similar U.S. measures, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to miss an opportunity to keep that promise anytime soon.
Forcing Washington to back down means agreeing to the demands, but for Chinese President Xi Jinping, public worship by the US is too shameful.
However, according to experts, if Beijing takes advantage of the situation correctly, the pressure in the trade war with the US could bring China an advantage in the long term, reducing the relationship between the two economies.
“A quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that will lead to a sharp economic downturn in any of the countries. And this is actually a bigger threat than observers have acknowledged before,” said Abigail Grace, an analyst at the Center for American Security.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs said that Syria is "ready" for the return of refugees
In Syria, they say they are ready for the voluntary return of refugees and are seeking help in restoring a country devastated by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem said conditions in the country were improving.
“Today, the real situation has become more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to restore areas destroyed by terrorists so that people can return to normal life.
All conditions have now been created for the voluntary return of refugees to a country they had to leave because of terrorism, as well as unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and limited livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian government would be pleased to receive assistance in restoring the war-torn country.
But he stressed that they would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that support the uprising.
Europe secures victory at the "Rider Cup" in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Rider's Cup when they defeated the U.S. team with a total score of 16.5:10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The U.S. team has suffered defeats in Europe for the sixth time in a row and has not won the Ryder Cup tournament since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the Danish captain Thomas Björn's team scored the 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
American star Phil Mikkelson, who tried his best most of the tournament, broke his first long shot at the 16th hole of Par-3 in the water and gave way to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won all of his rounds and became one of only four players ever to score 5–0–0 since the start of the tournament in a modern format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spite suffered defeats with a score of 5:4 from the player with the lowest rating in the European team Turbyern Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who takes the first step in the world rankings, conceded a 2:1 score to Jan Paulter of England, who may have participated in the Ryder Cup tournament for the last time.
Spaniard Sergio Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, a veteran of the "Rider's Cup", who has already participated in the tournament eight times, became the European who won the tournaments the most times in all time, bringing over his career 25.5 points.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t do anything today.
It was a difficult year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy to return the cup.
It's the team's merit and I'm glad I was able to help," Garcia said, without restraining his emotions after winning in Europe.
He transfers the relay to his compatriot John Remus, who on Sunday defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods in a 2-1 singles game.
“I’m incredibly proud of the victory over Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy,” said 23-year-old Ram.
In France, Woods lost all four matches and now holds a career record in the 13–21–3 Ryder Cup tournament.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 Major tournaments, surpassing only Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team tried to reach the fervey zone throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed high-class golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said of his team after an unsatisfactory performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, we dominated Europe for a short time.
We fought.
I take off my hat in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We're regrouping, I'm working with the U.S. Golf Professionals Association and the Rider's Cup tournament committee, and we're moving forward.
I love these 12 guys and am proud to be their captain.
We cannot fail to praise them.
We lost.”
Up-to-date information on the red tide: a decrease in concentrations in Pinellas, Manat and Sarasota counties
A recent report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decline in the flowering level of red microorganisms in some parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, conditions of abundant flowering reported in certain areas of Pinellas, Manat, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties indicate a decrease in concentration.
The flowering of red microorganisms extends approximately 130 miles of the coastline from the north of Pinellas to the southern districts of Li.
The spots can be found about 10 miles off the coast of Gillsboro County, but are less than last week.
The red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
Last week, the district of Collie reported an average concentration in Pinellas County and its coastal zone, a concentration from low to high in the coastal zone of Gillsboro County, a high concentration in Manat County, a high concentration in Sarasota County, a high concentration in Sarasota County and its coast.
Pinellas, Manat, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier continue to report respiratory irritation.
No such reports were recorded in the northwest of Florida last week.
