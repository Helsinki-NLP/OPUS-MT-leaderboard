No Liberating Novels for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian Parliament today rejected the request to abolish the paragraphs on the basis of which opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko was convicted, as part of a novella of the Criminal Code.
The new regulation, which could have paved the way for the release of the imprisoned Prime Minister, MEPs rejected at the second reading of the request for the mitigation of the penalties for economic crimes.
Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for concluding an allegedly unfavourable contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The verdict is not yet in force, the convictions will be heard in court in December.
Timoshenko himself described the verdict as a political revenge of the regime and also in the West, the trial raised suspicions of bias of the court.
The request, paragraph 365, on the basis of which the Prime Minister was convicted to remove from the Criminal Code, was supported by 147 MPs.
226 votes would have been required for its adoption.
The Libyan victory
The history of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Only the winners can be defined.
As is customary in this region, Islamists win in the elections, the question is only which - the moderate or the radical.
The National Transitional Council became aware of the customary law of the Shari’a, of which one now has a certain idea with God.
Libya would become a country without crime, because for theft, you cut off your hand.
Women should also quickly forget about the idea of emancipation, any detractors will be executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, society will be united by the Koran from mutually opposing tribes in the future.
In short - in Libya there will be an order that would be hardly imaginable and, above all, hardly desirable in this country.
Only - our lifestyle is now not the only and objectively not the best and would hardly fit the mentioned Libyans.
In this way, it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters were even helped by the infidel dogs.
Their apologies may only be for the fact that NATO’s airstrikes were not directed by any American general, but by Allah Himself, whose omnipotence was praised after every successful hit.
The victors in Libya? The West does not belong to it.
We only took part in a shootout, served the interests of Islam, and our politicians emptied themselves in the person of the dictator of a political ally without any advantage.
After the recent and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred to refrain from a military occupation of Libya.
As a result, the locals are getting rid of a concern - namely the expulsion of the crusaders.
But do the mineral oil companies get the black gold at the spot price even without occupation?
The West can at last boast of its selflessness in the protection of human rights.
If this does not destroy them the Shari’a representatives.
The Beginning of a New Era of Crisis
France and the rest of Europe in the focus of investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm surge broke through Europe.
Each country published its GDP data for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared to the previous quarter, Germany and France added.
Today, however, the bond market breaks all records.
Investors are not only keeping an eye on Greece, but also on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the European Union, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published their preliminary forecasts for economic development in the third quarter.
Germany’s GDP is expected to grow by 0.5%, while France’s GDP grew by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries corrected their data for the second quarter, in which Germany experienced higher growth than originally expected (growth of 0.3% instead of predicted 0.1%), while France conceded a slight decline of 0.1% (original data spoke only of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year.
Compared to the previous quarter, however, gross domestic product stagnated and, according to the Statistical Office, the trend of slowing growth in economic performance was confirmed.
So the results are worse than the forecasts of the analysts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year, but it stagnated compared to the previous quarter.
According to preliminary and seasonally adjusted data, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
In the euro area as a whole and in the EU, the economy grew by 0.2 per cent from the previous quarter between July and September, in line with analysts’ expectations.
The Greek economy contracted by 5.2 per cent compared to the previous year.
The return on their 10-year government bonds rose to 28.45%.
The return on Italian and Spanish government bonds rose to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are also starting to feel problems...
Yields on Czech government bonds remain below 4%, even though the situation in the region is deteriorating.
In Germany, voices are getting loud, the ECB is supposed to become the creditor of last resort.
The Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football selection has mastered the most difficult task of the entire season!
Thanks to a well-placed goalkeeper <0xC4><0x8C>ech and a magnificent goal by Petr Jir<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, she won in Montenegro 1-0.
With a great deal of luck, Czech football was able to defend its luxurious lead from home and will not be missing again at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the ascension game in a detailed report.
Little excitement in the first half and a huge amount of luck in the second.
The Czech national team also won a very happy 1-0 thanks to the weakness of the home team, a brilliant Czech and the hero of the day Jir<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek in Montenegro and thus redeemed their ticket for the football championship.
Due to the precise defensive play of the Czech team, they put more pressure on the Montenegrins only in the second half.
The bad luck birds of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who shot two giant shots.
Thanks to an excellent Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech, the Czech national team will participate in the European Championships next year, and it is also pleasing that the domestic football receives a premium of about 200 million.
From the first few minutes onwards, there was a lot of fighting football.
Both teams combined for a long time and so was mainly played around the middle line.
Also in the second half, the pressure of the home team remained out and the wide deflections in front of the penalty area were successfully defended by the Czech defense.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They formed a living shield.
Hundreds of college students formed a living sign around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country’s nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed Tuesday noon in front of the object and then announced the death of the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students from the University of Isfahan in Iran formed a living sign around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan on Tuesday, where uranium is being processed.
In doing so, they wanted to make known that they were ready to protect their country’s nuclear program, if necessary with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently stated in its report that Iran has apparently not given up on its efforts to develop a nuclear weapon for a long time.
In Israel, too, there is talk of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students had prayed at noon in front of the entrance to the complex and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
In the event of an intentional attack to paralyze Iran’s nuclear program, the Israeli press said the Isfahan nuclear enrichment facility would also be the target of Natan’s attack.
The menu of an obese child: he does not have breakfast and eats for dinner sausage
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have problems with obesity, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children being overweight.
Current surveys have shown - obese children mostly come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
This shows once again how important for a person’s healthy development is the environment in which he grows up and the examples that surround him.
On the tables of obese children, sausages are up to half more often on the table than in families where normal-weight children live.
More than 19 percent of the overweight children had potatoes for the evening meal on the day before the educational campaign under the motto "Adiposity is not a coincidence".
In families with dicks, sport is not exactly one of the favorite occupations, but it also affects the majority of today's students - only 15 percent answered that their parents find time for active exercise at least once a week.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place at the end of the school year last year, with nearly 900 children from primary schools across the Czech Republic being surveyed.
This was already the second year of the campaign "Adiposity is not a coincidence", which is supported by the General Health Fund and the company Unilever.
So far, more than 12 thousand students from 4th and 8th grades participated in the project.
Unhealthy diet and lack of movement in the family are crucial factors that are responsible for the appallingly increasing number of overweight or even obese children.
“Only half of the children surveyed, for example, reported eating breakfast-second breakfast-lunch-vesper-dinner-in-mode five times a day – one of the main prerequisites for a healthy diet,” according to one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Experts point out that even relative trifles, such as the family’s regular breakfast time, are important for a child’s healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of the pupils’ families have breakfast.
And - in most families, everyone eats breakfast alone.
Worst of all was the finding that in every tenth family no breakfast is served at all.
Breakfast is the cornerstone of a healthy daily diet.
Among other things, the survey showed that in families of overweight children, unhealthy potatoes are consumed much more often.
And almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet lemonade every day (70 percent)
While more than 40 percent of the children surveyed play sports, only less than half of their parents do — only 15 percent.
Set up your own menu
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to compile their own meal plan according to appetite and opinion.
"What Czech children between 12 and 15 prefer in terms of nutrition is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among their favorite dishes were many flour dishes, meat dishes and of course sweet dishes.
"Alarming is above all the great popularity of sweet lemonades," the final report on this survey emphasizes.
At lunch, i.e. the main course, pasta won just before poultry.
The children almost did not like legumes and also the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunch was very low.
Approach to health
At the same time, the survey also showed that children are quite willing to change their eating habits when they get the right information.
"In the control group of the survey participants, who completed the questionnaire after the conclusion of the enlightening lecture "Adiposity is not a coincidence", in many cases there was a significant shift in preferences towards principles of healthy diet, "is stated in the results of the project.
This was obvious, for example, in the sweet limos, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
The children also crossed in the questionnaire much more often poultry or fish as the main course of the day and were ready to eat less dumplings or sweet foods.
Pros claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article on how stylists learn, I had squeaked a bit that this was a bit too much fabric for the beginning.
I had no idea what else was coming.
Lectures by three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how this "in the square" is going.
It's supposed to get worse.
The closer we get to the exam, the more information and practical tasks we have ahead of us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully booked.
This time we discussed with director Alena (no single man is taking part in the course) how to attract a woman who does not have an ideally proportioned figure.
After all, these are most of us.
Some have too short a neck, others have too young a figure without proper curves, and others are cumbersome.
It is up to the stylist to visually hide broad shoulders, lengthen the neck or enchant the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to dress a woman like Jennifer Lopez - that is, with big breasts, wide hips and narrow waist - pretty and figure-emphasized without making her look too provocative.
For example, if the difference between waist and hips is so large that the skirt or pants really don't fit, you should have at least one piece tailor-made.
You will certainly not regret this, because well-fitting clothes are simply priceless.
In such a tailor-made skirt, you feel much better than in one of the bars, which always slips too high, in the waist, etc.
Boylike figures, in turn, can afford to wear clothing with wrinkles, studs, applications, embroidery or ruffles.
With this amount of information and figure types, I am glad that I have a whole week to let everything go through my head thoroughly.
And yet I am afraid that in view of the assigned homework, it is almost impossible to do.
Each of the course participants was awarded a celebrity, for which she is supposed to come up with suitable outfits - daywear and evening dress.
In doing so, we should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the corresponding star and its figure type.
I'm supposed to "dress" Miranda Kerr, who you may know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
Inside I rejoice, because this is much better for me personally, than, for example, to dress Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has probably increased to a hundred kilos in recent times (well, that's a bit exaggerated), or also the young Selena Gomez.
We should cut out the garments from magazines or search, print and then edit them graphically on the Internet.
In the "moodboard", as the whole result is called, our very personal style and our relationship to graphic design should be expressed.
It is very important to also think about the graphic side of the styling.
The stylist not only physically attracts the models, but also designs the so-called product page in the journals (according to a specific specification, for example trend handbags, coats, etc.).
This was told to us by the stylist and designer Mario Kamen<0xC3><0xAD>k.
But that's not until Sunday.
This means that a stylist must have a good overall overview.
The Saturday lecture, filled with information about figure types, was spiced up by three visitors from the industry:
by stylist Jan Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Ren<0xC4><0x8D>.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and that a stylist should be able to take advantage of it.
And clever stylist can work with a single piece of clothing in very different ways.
The magic word is variability.
For example, you can wear a trench coat as usual over the jeans, such as a t-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, wear heels and wear it as a dress.
It is enough to curl up the sleeves or collar and the whole look looks completely different.
“Play with it,” he emphasized.
Most of all, however, I found the following advice: "First you need to know the rules perfectly."
"Only then can you hurt her," said Jakub.
Finally, I understand why we need to pause all these teachings, what to combine with what and why, even if you often get to see something completely different in fashion magazines.
Not to mention fashion shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared a lot more clothing variants than he eventually photographed.
So you have to be prepared for a ten-page fashion story (i.e. ten outfits) to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing on the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks quite different than in reality.
All of this must be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Jan Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD> also confirmed that image and style sometimes make up half of the success.
It only takes Madonna to see a not exactly brilliant singer, from whom image and marketing have made a world star.
In the Czech Republic, you are more reserved for the services of a stylist.
Also known personalities often consider this to be thrown out money (the main thing is that I bring something that I look like is secondary).
And if one of us can already be styled, then we should expect that he or she will most likely impose on us a completely different (smaller) size than he or she actually needs.
Then you only need to google to find out with certainty that the Boulevard press writes, the corresponding celebrity has returned to or decreased, etc.
Jan and Mario reminded us on Sunday not to believe that a stylist just needs to focus on fashion and then "build" the outfit.
In his work, he must above all communicate with the people he styles and he must be a determined psychologist.
Assess people without offering themselves and stand by their opinion.
“If any manager orders us to look at her wardrobe and to complement pretty pieces, then we can’t clear her entire closet and say, ‘Oh, my God, that’s terrible.’”
“You have to find at least a few praiseworthy things to recommend what you can wear,” says Mario.
He also showed us quite specifically what a so-called "place bag" must contain.
So such a bag that you tie to the waist and in which you carry with you all the necessary properties.
In addition to such clear things as scissors, decoys for hair removal or safety needles, it also naturally contains such utensils as a nylon thread (so the stylist helps himself to photograph products, such as handbags or hats out), special clips with which the back of the garment is rubbed, if it is not too large, or bare under the clothes.
But in order not only to listen, but also to try something practical, we learned how to properly glue shoes.
Even when photographing in the studio, where the floor is flat, you can damage the shoe sole, not to mention the outside.
We used to stick and stick...
With the scissors you can not even touch the shoes, so that you do not damage them.
So you really have to be smart.
Mario delighted me by praising my "creation" without restrictions.
The skill mentioned is not exactly my strength.
All this was only a fraction of what we heard on the second weekend continuation course.
One thing has become clear to me by now - to dedicate oneself to styling on a professional level is not a child's play.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Reviewed
The initially carefree ride is caused by a series of completely avoidable, dilettant errors in the routine ride to the early stage.
We managed to fulfill the ambitions for the most part, but what good is that if obviously no one had the desire to do a little more?
Even before he got to the store tables, the new part with the subtitle "The Run" raised high expectations.
After all, he promised to move the already-aged game series "Need for Speed" again to a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples he did not actually seem to be just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious as to how the fitted passages turn out, in which the main protagonist gets out of the car and continues on foot.
But as you are used to with NFS, in the end, much is different than you expected.
Sure - potentially they are quite decent arcade races, but overall the game is fraught with some superfluous flaws that have been present in this series for more or less a few years.
So they’re not really mistakes anymore, but rather signs of a basically incomprehensible laziness of the game developers.
The adventure begins very well.
For the first time, they are introduced to the story, whose main character Jack has certain problems of a personal character; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, that is, on the west coast, you sit on the steering wheel - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea includes a number of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race is held on a different track and that the individual stages take place in a different, sufficiently different and interesting environment.
One does not have the impression that the game would offer the same thing over and over again.
Some environments are still very nice to look at, although the technical level of the graphics does not go beyond that of the earlier parts of the series.
Nothing that moves the world.
But the drive through the desert, through autumn landscape or high up through deep snowy landscape seems visually very pleasant.
Occasionally, atypical elements bring a little variation to the individual races.
In the desert, for example, one is surprised by a desert storm, which severely restricts the view.
In the mountains, in turn, you have to be careful not to be spilled by an avalanche.
By the way, the individual races are installed quite well in succession.
Only a few, but they are enough.
For a while you try to overcome the required number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to pick up (classic race against the stopwatch), then you expect another personal duel with a single opponent.
And the police are also involved in this, which wants to mess up the whole thing.
A novelty are passages in which Jack leaves the car.
This is more about certain interactive animations in which Jack escapes from someone and where the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are far fewer such passages in the game than one would expect (only three in particular).
Ultimately, this is the thing rather to the advantage, because so this element has at least no chance of getting bored - it belongs in the context of the above mentioned elements that make the game more varied.
The driving model steps in the footsteps of the previous parts.
That is, from today's point of view, although it does not tear down trees, on the other hand, one could not say that it would be bad.
If you are looking for realistic simulations, you need to look elsewhere.
But an action-packed racing will still be well suited to the local driving model, although you could find better ones in the competition.
Until then, everything is in good order.
Real problems do not appear until after some time.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not entirely OK.
From a game of this kind is hardly expected that it calculates complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have practically no idea before any impact on any object, how the car behaves, then obviously not everything is fine.
Typical example: In the case of close overtaking or passing on opposite cars, in some places you "strike" the other car only slightly, but in other, almost identical situations you get into the throttle and turn wild pirouettes.
Or the car will go to waste.
Thanks to the restart system, it does not matter any more, it is always annoying.
The restarts are solved in this way: if you have total damage or land far off the track, then the game throws you back to the last point of the track.
Only - in each race you have only five restarts.
When you have exhausted them, everything starts from the front..
So the restarts are more like a tool, in case something fails, but you should not rely on it.
Sometimes, however, not even the restart helps, since nothing helps but to learn the critical section from the head.
It’s very unfortunate that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, you have to go through some curves in a very specific way, otherwise you simply do not fit through.
Elsewhere you will encounter "civil" cars in the same configuration, whether you arrive first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations when you see the opponent pass two cars in front of you, but until you get there yourself, the cars are already in such a position that you have to circumnavigate them or brake them.
And it doesn’t matter when you get there, everything is designed in such a way that it always comes close to your nose.
The contractors have other advantages.
Throughout the game, there are a few places where you are always overtaken by the same opponent at the same place and also here again regardless of the time.
The craziest is this to finish the game on the long bridge, which you pass in the opposite direction.
The opponent has to obviously overtake one of the devils out here.
And if he is already in front of you, then of course he takes the view, so that you drive your own car a few times in lump.
Sure - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting but this intention is so clear that it quickly disappears the joy of the game.
And that’s a shame, because despite the simpler driving model, the game is quite entertaining and sometimes also so loaded with action that you almost don’t know where one’s head is.
And in principle, it does not matter what is "guilty" of it - the concept with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in a way that no boredom can arise, or something completely different...
An unusual idea is also the change of car during the races.
You should not miss the gas stations on the route, because here you can change the car, although in most cases the car you just have is enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for the urban areas, the strong American sedans for the straight highways and exotic super sports cars for the technical rides, for example on the serpentines in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the mode of the game story also goes the task mode (challenges) - that is, the races in the individual localities that you know from the story.
Here there are not only medals, but also experience points for your own profile, which is common for the tasks (challenges) and history.
To get to the higher level of the driver, different items must be unlocked: from the car to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is simultaneously connected to the online function Autolog, which among other things compares the own results achieved with those of other players and also provides for other collective functions.
One of the other incomprehensible carvings is a situation in the last race of history.
Here you get by car into a subway tunnel (because of me), where you can rest in the dark on the rails for a long time (because of me).
On the tacho, numbers look between 150 and 200 km/h (due to me), but suddenly a subway comes from behind and drives uncompromisingly to scrap.
In our editorial we will probably argue for a long time about whether this was a blackout of the game designers or whether the authors think us so stupid.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the overall visual impression is quite appealing in most cases and here and there even brilliant.
The more annoying it is, that in some exciting moments the image recovery frequency slows down and this is sometimes quite dramatic.
However, this is especially true for accidents with a larger number of participants, where a continuous FPS is of no use to you anyway.
The sound is OK and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to reach as wide a scale as possible rather young audiences, a soundtrack a l<0xC3><0xA1> "something" was created - but who buys such a game already because of the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are rather mixed.
If the game hadn’t been narrowed down by the above-mentioned totally unnecessary flaws, we would have been able to assert with the chest tone of conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But somehow the game seems unfinished.
In itself a great pleasure, but one should be prepared to face these mistakes with the power of airport headlights.
Concert of "Students of the Velvet Revolution" with singing ensembles of Charles University
The Festival Festa Academica now offers for the third time the reconciliation of the World Students’ Day with the anniversary of the Samtenen Revolution and this together with musical experience.
During the festival, the twenty specialist and university choirs will present themselves.
The focus of the festival are the two concerts that take place on November 17.
"The Charles University has a large share in the festival."
"Among the participants is also the choir of the Faculty of Education and the Faculty of Humanistic Studies, and the festival committee also includes the Rector V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Hampl," said the head of the organizing team, Jakub <0xC4><0x8C>aloun.
The absolute highlight of the festival is the public concert of specialist school choirs, which takes place on November 17 at 2 pm on the square in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
On the program is the composition of the important Czech jazz player Karel R<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC4><0x8D>ka "Celebration Jazz Mass".

EU Ambassador Viceenov<0xC3><0xA1>:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativeists and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has brought the balance between the individual institutions to a noticeable halt."
I didn’t expect such a hard war to start.”
"It will take five or six years for the waves to smooth out and everyone will get used to their new role," Milena Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1>, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
In the first part of her lecture, she showed how serious she is with the motto "Intelligible and open about Europe", in which she managed to describe the individual EU institutions and their mutual relations in such a clear and understandable way that she could have envied so many lecturers of the Faculty of Law at Charles University.
Ms Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1> also praised the new permanent President of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first, criticism became loud that he was too inconspicuous - a gray official who hadn't grown up in such a role, but I have to say it took everyone's breath away how well he accepted the matter.
"He is a person who finishes listening to twenty-seven member states patiently, communicating with them, and above all has clear ideas of how to proceed with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy was then explained in response to the question: Who is this - the European Union? What number should I call?", i.e. as an important step towards unification and better readability of EU policy towards countries such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us our oil cappers quartz
Ms Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1> also dedicated herself to the agenda under which the European Union lived, lives and intends to live in the near future.
She called the Czech Presidency of two years ago a success.
The Czechs had mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also hosted the Eastern Partnership summit.
She described the government’s case during the presidency as a great negativity, which greatly damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU currently has everything to do.
In the words of the Ambassador, not only the Presidency, but also the subsequent crisis, which has not yet been overcome, has been quite hectic.
And the EU’s seven-year budget has yet to be approved, which makes the matter much more complicated precisely because of today’s economic situation.
Whether it will be a sleek and thrifty budget, which industries will take precedence, which countries will receive more and which less funding - all this is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also recalls her own slogans with which she came to Brussels: "Understandable about Europe".
“If I don’t like something, it’s cruel abbreviations, foreign words and technical jargon that no one understands.
How can I, as a citizen, really know if you really think of curvy or round cucumbers and various large bananas in Brussels or if someone really wants to ban us from the quartz?
She would also have liked to use the EU’s soil to get more Czechs into European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in view
According to the EU ambassador, the Czechs are in a position to be Eurosceptics who perceive more the negative than the positive sides of the matter.
The weak representation of Czechs in European institutions is all the more annoying.
This is due to many factors, including the reluctance of our candidates, their inability to write letters of motivation and, last but not least, the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, it also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
"Believe me, when a Pole or Hungarian comes to me and a Slovak is nearby, then the Frenchman next to me thinks, 'Hey, what are your heads together - is this your V4 again?' and makes a rather sour mind.
According to Ms Vicenové, in the future the EU expects, above all, tough rules for the budgetary policies of the Member States.
As much more real than a "European federation", it sees the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
“We have here the countries of the Eurozone and the countries outside the Eurozone.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the institution of enhanced cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that only the countries that want to work together and those that don't want to work together should be quietly away."
"There will be more and more such institutions, which ultimately leads to a strong 'Europe of different speeds'", expects Ms Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1>.
In this regard, it also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in enforcing the principle that all issues with an impact on the EU as a whole must be discussed by all Member States and not only by the euro area countries.

Innovator IBM enters the second century of its existence
If you wanted to look for a suitable word that most accurately characterizes IBM’s strategy, it would probably be the word “longevity”.
For the general public, IBM is synonymous with technological revolution, it is known as a modern company, although it has passed a century since its foundation.
The basis for this longevity was already laid by her first boss - the visionary Thomas J. Watson sen.
Already he represented the slogan, countless worldwide problems could easily be solved if people were willing to think a little.
His slogan "Think!" became a trademark for the life of the future giant (and at the same time the title of the company's in-house magazine, which began to be published at IBM as early as 1935).
This was also the basis of the corporate culture thoroughly prepared by Watsen.
“For us at IBM, this long-term thinking means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was successful for a century because it remained true to its principles and did not shy away from changing everything else around.
This allowed us, over the course of our first century, to transform the technologies, the business and also the society.
We hope to do even more in the next hundred years,” said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company’s current CEO on the occasion of the anniversary.
A well-thought-out system
Watson was already in the thirties in the social care of his employees - in a similar way to the entrepreneur Bata in Czechoslovakia: the IBM people had paid holidays as one of the first American employees, an insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as work clothes and a well-thought-out salary system.
IBM’s long-term relationships with its customers are equally sophisticated.
The company was brilliant in talent promotion from the beginning - as one of the first companies in the world, IBM lifted any discrimination - and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy is also the current plan to replace Palmisan at the top of IBM next year by a woman – Virginia Rometty.
She has been with IBM for thirty years, so far she has taken the position of Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM has been doing so-called online brainstorming in recent years, from which many future strategies and innovations emerge.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, almost half a million people are employed in the company.
An institution with a good reputation
Its unwavering position in the business guarantees the company a strong image, both internally and externally.
“From the outset, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company,” said Harvard Business School professor and author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
“IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technology,” added George Colony of consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself emphasizes, it is a difference to be only present in the market or to shape it directly through this presence.
IBM - in the states of its logo because of the familiar "Big Blue", has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies ever - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in an incredible range of products - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies, IBM holds the most patents, and five of its employees have already been awarded the Nobel Prize.
His most well-known inventions include, for example, ATMs, credit cards, financial swaps, barcodes or even the floppy disks.
With approximately $220 billion in market capitalization, IBM was the second-largest technology company this year (just like Apple), surpassing Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
The foreseeable future
Not all products and innovations met the taste of today's customers - unhappy were, for example, the attempt with its own operating system OS/2, the online service Prodigy or even the computers IBM PC Jr.
“Business is based on the forward movement, so you can’t be emotionally tied to the past,” says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That’s why IBM has no problem building its foundations on different platforms – and if they don’t work, leaving them too.
In contrast to the opponent Microsoft, which in principle stands and falls with its operating system Windows.
Promising technologies
IBM’s revenues are largely driven by services, software and hardware, accounting for one-fifth of each.
In 1990, hardware with a share of more than fifty percent was the most represented.
Since 2000, IBM has sold $15 billion in low-profit assets, while at the same time it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future-proof technologies.
These investments continue even after 2008, when the modern financial crisis swept the world for the first time like a storm.
Here, too, IBM remained faithful to the legacy of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who increased its investment amid the great global economic crisis.
So far, it seems that the company IBM survives the current crisis unharmed.
The value of IBM shares has increased by 120 percent in a rocket-like manner since 2008, and the company’s net profit is growing continuously.
IBM’s corporate slogan is: Everything can be changed – only the values cannot be changed.
This is also why it can be expected that this flexible giant will also cope with the next crisis.
IBM History: From Cheese Cutter to Space Flight
Founded a hundred years ago in New York, IBM (International Business Machines) initially had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was not adopted until 1924 - originally it was a brand name for an office in Canada and South America.
The foundation for the later IBM company was the merger of four companies, whose history dates back to the 1980s.
They possessed technologies such as the famous punch-card clocks for registering the start and end of work.
The architect of this new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who also held the chairmanship of the Supervisory Board until 1930.
And it was Flint who hired Thomas J. Watson, the head of the competition company, to help him run the company.
This leader even overshadowed IBM’s founders – based on Watson’s ideas to this day, the company’s invincible culture and identity.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, began manufacturing and distributing all sorts of machines for trade – from sausage and cheese slicers to cash registers.
In the first four decades that Watson led the company, he doubled its sales to nine million dollars and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that he sat in the executive chair for forty years, only then he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, engineers and computers from IBM helped NASA direct flights into space – to Mercury and Saturn, and in 1969 also the famous flight of man to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC that set the computer standard of the time came on the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand, it bought the consultant share of PricewaterhouseCoopers and thus fully entered the business of consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy that IBM has been paying off over the past three years is the “Smarter Planet” concept.
It embodies the intention to use technologies wisely in areas not even planned so far, e.g. also to improve the situation in transport and urban management.
In the trading sector, IBM recently introduced the "Smart Commerce" platform, which is designed to help traders lead the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
In 1932, IBM established a branch in Czechoslovakia, the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM <0xC4><0x8C>R also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Central Office for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague and here is also a top-level research team that deals with the technology of voice recognition.
Darina Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta - you can keep this donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> (53) says - now is the end!
After her husband Josef Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> (53) became her lover by the protector of Iveta Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1> (45), Darina still remained hopeful that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the next life she has set clear rules.
"Joseph can come home, but no more than my partner," Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
When Darina Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1>, the singer I. Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1>, had offered refuge in her own house, she probably would not have even dreamed of what it would be like with her husband.
When Iveta went back to <0xC5><0x98><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>any after 30 days on her urges, Joseph immediately went with her.
He even publicly confessed that he loved her.
In time, Darina resigned, indeed it seemed as if she wanted to reconcile with her unfaithful husband again - but now she finally gave him the runway pass.
Rychyt<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> doesn't care who his wife sleeps with
If Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> should leave Iveta Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1> in the future, then he will surely not receive open arms at home.
"He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, then I will not chase him out."
"But not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a person with whom I still have certain ties," said Mrs Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1>; but she also said that she had already separated herself from him emotionally and insisted only on mutual decency.
The fact that Darina locked the back door for him carries Joseph with dignity so far.
“I respect my wife’s decision.”
"I'm staying with Iveta, that doesn't change anything."
"My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect that."
"The company continues, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I make the purchases."
"I have a normal conversation with Darina, we just don't share the bed," Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> told Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, he doesn't want to stop her.
“We don’t sleep together, so I don’t care if she has a boyfriend or who that is.
I realize that this is my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and that is why I take all the responsibility.
The Worst Female Indebtedness: What About You?
When you ask men to name some typical female indulgences, they shake some out of the sleeve without exception.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, in which we pass a few insatiable revues again, which cause the blood to flow into the veins of men?
Purchasing
Does your husband accuse you of being a shopaholic?
Do you need to buy at least one hatchery per week?
Do you like to go shopping and can it also be a little more at promotions?
Then in your case it is really a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their shopping cravings in check.
But hand on heart, which woman already can’t stand to wander through a clothing store in search of a well-fitting upper garment and not try all the same (in all sorts of color combinations) in the cabin?
Although shopping is a hobby for most women, for men it is often pure hell.
Think about how many times they've told their husband, you'd better stay out there.
Constant dissatisfaction
“Am I not too fat?”
"I would have to lose at least five pounds - should I start jogging or doing gymnastics?"
"Do you like me at all?"
Does that seem familiar to you somehow?
- Yes?
Then you are probably one of the women who are really obsessed with what they look like.
That doesn’t mean you should let go, but many men are allergic to it when their wife is constantly complaining about her appearance.
The stronger sex agrees - with increasing frequency of complaints, women are increasingly intolerable.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's a fight against windmills.
Cleaning windows, wiping tiles and dust, rubbing the tub - and this at least twice a week.
Do you gossip with your partner because he is trampling again with dirty shoes on the clean tiles, do you scold the children because the just shattered washbasin is already dirty again and because the glass door at the living room cabinet already has fingerprints again, where does polishing work so hard?
If you suffer from this type of "deviance", then you should know that you should not exaggerate anything and order and cleanliness in family life are not the first priority.
This immeasurable purity can ultimately also harm mutual relations and, above all, the peace in the family.
Stitching
"Dirty gym pants come into the laundry basket."
"Do you really want to wear the old socks again tomorrow?"
"You don't just throw a wet towel on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, do not be surprised that this brings him to the palm.
Of course, this is not bad, they just want everything to be in order.
If the men knew this, then the women might not need to sniff so much.
Slap and Slap
Some women like to slap and sneeze, there is scolding behind their backs or even slandering or forging alliances.
Women are now focused on relationships, which is why they like to cherish such topics as who, where, with whom, how and why.
Well, each of us women has a little harmless slap and slap in stock.
Hand on heart - that's probably all women's business.
However, this is not to be confused with the most coarse caliber of clappers, to whom nothing and no one is sacred, who probably despise everyone in their environment and who represent a considerable danger, especially for women's collectives.
J<0xC3><0xA1>gr and Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek assist Philadelphia to victory
Jarom<0xC3><0xAD>r J<0xC3><0xA1>gr was the most productive Czech player in the NHL at Monday’s NHL game with two assists in Philadelphia’s 5:3 win over Carolina.
Beneficiary of the overview of the thirty-nine-year-old ice hockey star was in both cases Claude Giroux, who added one more assist and was named the best player of the match.
J<0xC3><0xA1>gr's teammate Jakub Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek also recorded two assists in the same game.
After the game, J<0xC3><0xA1>gr told reporters that he had prophesied a great evening for Giroux.
"Before the game, I'm telling him he's got a hat trick today."
I kind of felt that.”
"Once in a while, such a feeling emerges," explained J<0xC3><0xA1>gr, whose action Giroux scored a goal on the first shot of the Flyers.
A little later, the second hit also had "a Czech lead".
Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek defeated the Puck behind the Hurricanes goal and placed it between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
A second before the first third was knocked out, Patrick Dwyer scored a short-hander, but the second third again belonged to the flyers.
Specifically Giroux.
In collaboration with J<0xC3><0xA1>gr, he scored his third goal, after which Wayne Simmonds steered his shot to the fourth goal.
“I love playing with him.”
“I don’t want to say he’s the best player in the league, but he’s definitely one of the top three,” J<0xC3><0xA1>gr said.
"I wouldn't have imagined in my life that I would end my career with such an ice hockey player as I would with him."
"I'm very happy about that."
"I'm cutting my game to myself."
“All those years in the NHL, my teammates put their game on me and now the game is turning around,” J<0xC3><0xA1>gr said.
Carolina turned the game into drama - through the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and again Dwyer, who pushed through from a penalty shot, it came to a goal.
However, Matt Read prevented any further complication in which he was successful in excess of two against one.
"Excellent Pronger still acted in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I took the ride and (read) moved to distant posts."
"I tried to hit him and I'm glad it worked out," Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek described the last match of the match from his point of view.
This victory put Philadelphia at the forefront of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender from Montreal Jaroslav <0xC5><0xA0>pa<0xC4><0x8D>ek injured himself in the game against Buffalo and retired in the second third due to an injury to the upper body.
In addition to their experienced Beck, the Candians also fined their lead an undefeated in the penalty shootout 2:3.
One of the penalty shots could not transform Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plekanec.
More than the points lost hurt the coach of the home team probably the high disease-related failure in the defensive - the game they played with only five defenders to finish.
"That's bad."
"We ended the meeting with only one experienced player, the rest were young players."
"But nothing can be done about it, we have to get through it," said Jacques Martin.
"With every change, one attack wave after another and we had nothing to oppose it."
"We should have made the game easier and had to get the puck out of our third."
Here there were still reserves," said P. K. Subban, one of the defenders.
Czech goalkeeper Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Pavelec defended thirty shots from Tampa Bay and thus contributed significantly to the 5:2 victory over Winnipeg.
On the gates of the jets, which ended with a series of five defeats, five different shooters had a share.
Development of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five authorized state travel agencies in the then <0xC4><0x8C>SSR: <0xC4><0x8C>edok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autoturist.
The travel agencies at that time mainly sold only trips to the socialist eastern bloc countries, in the west only select people were allowed at that time.
And so Czech tourists traveled to the Baltic Sea (to the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the peninsula of Crimea on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to the Balaton.
A slight exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was also allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia took a pro-Western course and therefore travel to Yugoslavia was severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that not even citizens of the Eastern Bloc (also the Czechoslovaks) were allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual travel was not possible.
Even then, the travel agencies also offered trips to the west, but then you had to buy huge snakes or also spend the night in a sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
This was not the case for a long time.
The so-called currency usage - the condition for a trip to the West - was only given to "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so without currency use it would have been impossible to raise the necessary funds (Western currency) for a trip to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs therefore spent their holidays in the country, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and Datschen - a habit that continues to this day.
The Velvet Revolution of 1989 was followed by a travel revolution of the Czechs on foot.
While until 1989 a holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria was the measure of all things, the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their holidays abroad in countries around the world last year.
A huge paradox, of which one is no longer aware, is the fact that one could not travel to the currently most popular holiday country of the Czech Republic - Croatia until 1989 at all, because it was part of the then Yugoslavia.
Right from the beginning of the 90s of the last century, the foreign exchange obligation was lifted in the neighboring Western European countries, which resulted in a huge wave of short visits especially to Vienna in Austria and to Germany.
The Czechoslovaks simply could not get enough of their trips to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to be there for at least a few days.
For example, the Czech holidaymakers slept in a tent in the park when traveling to Paris, because who would have had the money for accommodation in a hotel or in a pension at that time.
A typical feature of travel abroad from the Czech Republic at that time was a packed trunk with cans, beer and sausage, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech crown - after decades, our tourists were finally able to buy the western currency freely.
Our standard of living, and thus the average wages, rose, which led to another important moment in 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, after 1997, travel agencies began to prepare for charter flights on a regular basis, which made air travel incredibly cheap compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of negotiating volume discounts.
By the end of the 1990s, Czechs, with the exception of the United States, had already had currency-free payment transactions with all the advanced countries of the world, making travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of "post-all" tourism came in 2000, when thanks to high demand, the first direct charter flight to an exotic country was made - to Thailand.
Since then, Czech direct charter planes with Czech passengers have been flying to far-flung sunny countries every year; this year, twelve exotic destinations are flying directly from the Czech Republic.
To the 100 Tsd. Czechs travel annually to exotic countries!
Another significant moment in the era that marked our “post-revolutionary” development came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the U.S. lifted the visa requirement for Czech tourists, making our country one of the most advanced countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs spent for the first time more than half of their holiday abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history they spent more than CZK 15 Tsd. per capita for a single holiday.
The General Assembly is supposed to find a new chairman - once again a pat threatens.
For almost five months now, Czech football has no chairman and threatens that the successor of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek at the head of the Czech Football Association (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R) will not even be known after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk.
To date, no agreement has been reached on the electoral procedure.
And without this, no vote on the three potential successors is possible at all.
Three interested parties want to manage the Czech football - Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k.
In June, Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek resigned from his position, urging his colleagues to agree and find a strong personality who can lead football in the future.
Only - in the era after Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek, the old quarrels between the two chambers of association broke out again, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was clear and clear on September 16, when the new chairman was to be selected.
The delegates of the General Assembly had come to the House of Commons in the Sm<0xC3><0xAD>chov district of Prague in vain, because the negotiation did not lead to any result and it was not only about the election itself.
It was not even possible to agree on who actually has the right to vote in the Plenary Assembly - only the statutory representatives or even the officials equipped with a power of attorney.
At least part of the agreement was reached on this one point, which also contributed to the recommendation of the Institute for State and Law, which, in its opinion, was not representative on a proxy basis.
However, disputes over the electoral order continue.
Even the Executive Committee did not bring any more clarity on the matter, at its meetings - whether ordinary or extraordinary - in principle nothing else is on the agenda at all.
Even if the views on the election changed a few times - the neuralgic point remained the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the 3rd round to avoid a pat situation?
"The point of contention concerns whether to act in accordance with the statute, or whether a completely different model must be found," said Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Svoboda, one of the three FA<0xC4><0x8C>R vice-chairmen representing professional football in the management.
According to the statutory model, in the third round, the candidate who receives the higher percentage of support in the chamber for which he candidates wins.
Moran is said to be willing to compromise that the candidate who receives the highest number of votes from both chambers will win.
The Czech side, in turn, insists on the condition that the winner receives at least a two-thirds majority in this percentage vote count.
"Then the two preliminary rounds no longer make sense at all, this mode would call into question the whole concept of the two-chamber", understands Svoboda the objections of the Moravian side, which would find it best not to bend the electoral order, but to choose according to the valid statute.
Surprisingly, Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k agrees with this, even though it turns out that the constituencies of all the candidates are most likely to meet Pelta.
"My wish is that as far as possible, the constitution will be adopted."
"So that no senseless alternatives are invented, as at the last general meeting," said the owner (of the football club) Victoria Plze<0xC5><0x88>, who ran for the first time and distinguished himself from Pelta in his comments.
But Pelta remains optimistic.
In his opinion, the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also cooperate constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the European Football Championship today would certainly contribute to calming the minds."
"If football rides on the euphoric wave, then there is also a greater willingness to cooperate," says the official from Jablonec, who brings the greatest experience of all three adepts, both professionally and regionally.
Rajchl is more restrained.
"I hope for an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is ambiguous."
"This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are some efforts to "bend" the rules for their own purposes."
"Therefore, a new blockade at the Annual General Meeting is not excluded."
“I hope, however, that common sense ultimately wins,” Rajchl said.
Only - there is not much time left to agree on all sides.
Some negotiations were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the generality of football until the qualifying game will be complete at all.
The charter aircraft, with which Dalibor Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era and Rajchl were supposed to fly to Podgorice, could not start in the morning in Prague due to a technical malfunction and so one was feverishly looking for a replacement variant, as to bring a part of the executive committee to the venue of the barrage play.
Ultimately, however, the meeting at ministerial level, which is supposed to come on Wednesday, is crucial.
Josef Dobe<0xC5><0xA1>, the Minister of Education, Youth and Physical Education, would have liked to move the divided parties within the largest sports association in the country to an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: government grants, the credibility of Czech football and also the upcoming Annual General Meeting of <0xC4><0x8C>STV, which is supposed to lead the Czech sport in a new direction after the financial problems of Sazka.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k goes into the fight for the position of the chairman because he does not see a suitable candidate
If Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pack<0xC3><0xAD>k, the head of Pilsen’s footballers before the Extraordinary General Assembly, could have been a strong candidate who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), he would not have entered the fight for this top position at all.
“If there was a good candidate, I would fight for him and give up the election.”
"But in the current situation, it was not possible to find such an adept," Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k told <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
The main reason for Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k to go into the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, is to prevent the alleged favorite of the choice, Pelta, from reaching the top of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k also stresses that in the event of his victory, he only intends to exercise the function of chairman for one year, i.e. until 2013, until the date of the ordinary general meeting.
In the position of chairman, he would have liked to see an experienced top manager who is not too much involved in football.
“I have spoken to some of the people in question personally.”
"I can't believe some people told me they didn't want to identify with Czech football at the moment.
“Such views would have liked to have changed,” he said.
Most of all, Packl<0xC3><0xAD>k's connection to Pilsner District Football Association chairman Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation who is seen behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist, is said to interfere with the ability to influence delegates' votes at main meetings.
For Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, it is therefore unacceptable for Pelta to hold the position of chairman.
"With his victory, the state of today would be preserved and there would be no progress in Czech football at all."
"Support from Berbr, a smart businessman, would get football twice as bad," Packl<0xC3><0xAD>k stressed.
In doing so, he also points out that Pelta's name fell some time ago in connection with telephone interrogations for investigation in a corruption case, but from which Pelta emerged unpunished.
"I don't know what prestige a victory from Pelta should bring to football."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said <0xC5><0xA1>elj<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D> Packl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who said in his previous statement, "he will sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta becomes chairman", but already sees a little calmer.
However, if Packl<0xC3><0xAD>k wins Thursday’s election, he can imagine a future collaboration with Pelta.
Similarly, another candidate - Rajchl, who had supported Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k before the General Assembly in October, which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go to."
"He has great abilities".
“I think I could think of him as the head of the national team.”
"But I don't think he's capable of leading the association as a manager."
"I don't put my nose in matters that I don't understand," said Packl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who in September caused a stir that he was at the head of the arbitration panel with Lu<0xC4><0x8F><0xC4><0x9B>k Macela, whom Dagmar Damkov<0xC3><0xA1> replaced.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k himself claims that he feels the role of the association chairman has grown.
He is also the head of Pilsen, which, with his support, celebrated the first triumph in the league in May.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and contribute to a certain cultivation of it."
"In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups, which tend to influence disciplinary and appeals commissions, which even leads to repulsive situations," said Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who does not make a single point of his antipathy towards Spartan leader Daniel K<0xC5><0x99>et<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD>, for example.
As one of his priorities, he sees the strengthening of relations between the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would lobby top politicians for more money from the lottery tax to flow into the sport.
"This is one of the crucial things the new chairman should be dedicated to."
“When it comes to the taxation of gambling, as the political parties declare, then I understand their argument, but then they also have to klipp and clearly say where the money is going,” he said.
His connection to the Pilsner Club also does not regard Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k as a handicap, although he himself stresses that the chairman of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R must be "partisan".
Pelta in turn is associated with Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla.
“That’s not exactly ideal.”
"But in my opinion, it doesn't make much sense to transfer my shares in Pilsner Klub to a third party to return after a year and a half," Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k said.
Pelta promised new FA<0xC4><0x8C>R statutes that would rule out a Patt situation in the future.
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, one of the candidates for the presidency, namely Miroslav Pelta, promised that in the event of his election, he would strengthen himself to ensure that the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R gets new statutes, which in the future exclude disputes about the electoral order from the outset.
The official from Jablonec is confident before Thursday's hearing in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will surely be defunct if the Czech selection succeeds.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealized election in September that he would focus on the national team and raising funds in the event of his election.
He only decided at the last moment to participate in the election before the last general meeting and so the two-month break helped him defend his ideas about the direction of football and introduce them in a wider context.
"People at all levels are dedicated to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"He feels it is high time that the association is headed by someone," said the man, who is mainly associated with the Jablonecer club, but who also worked for many years at Sparta and on the executive committee.
This is also why he believes that he has sufficient experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that the euphoria that prevailed at the time of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek is responsible for today’s problems with the election.
"Unfortunately, at the General Assembly in June, statutes were approved that were not as perfect as everyone had assumed.
If they hadn’t allowed different interpretations, we would have had a chairman from September onwards,” Pelta said.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the Citizens' Association that he used as a lure for the delegates.
“If I’m going to be president, I’m going to take that personally and I’m willing to take personal responsibility if it doesn’t work out.”
“This is a principled thing without which he cannot be,” Pelta claims.
Furthermore, he does not try to differentiate himself from his counterparts.
Earlier, he had announced that he could imagine a collaboration with Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, which he recognizes because of his legal education and he knows well that his opponent would be his first deputy.
Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k also did not attack for a long time, which in turn did not leave a dry thread on Pelta.
He has been in football for over a year and can already refer to certain successes."
“His attacks were declining, however, and many people were shocked by his election campaign.”
"That's why many are now doubting his real character," Pelta told his opponent, who is likely to remain true to his proclamations, which he already made in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest playing classes to the national team.
And this should be the hallmark of Czech football.
"I would also make every effort to end all affairs - from the cause of Bohemians to the aftermath of last year's corruption scandal."
"Equally after that, I would jump to negotiations with the private and state sector to ensure sufficient funding for the whole football," said the forty-six-year-old candidate <0xC4><0x8C>TK two months ago.
At the time, he also promised that his entry into the top of Czech football would not mean any personal cleansing.
"I would first have to familiarize myself with the work content of all employees," he said in the direction of Strahov, where, due to the long anarchy, there is understandably nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming General Assembly, he believes that the delegates will not travel to Nymburk for free on Thursday.
“If the only point of contention really is how to choose in the third round, then we’ll get over it.”
“Football needs credibility, and that only wins it back when it finally has a new leader,” Pelta said, two days before the potentially crucial day of his official career.
Rajchl promises that the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R begins to work hard under him
If the former deputy chairman Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl were to be elected as the new chairman of the Czech Football Association at the General Assembly on Thursday, this would allegedly stir the mood for many people in the association.
Rajchl promises that in the event of his election, you will start to work hard.
He wants to introduce system changes and make the members of the executive committee responsible for individual football areas.
In addition, he promised to solve the case of Bohemians, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money into football and otherwise continue the work that the previous chairman Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek has begun.
"As president, I want to dedicate myself to football as a whole."
From international contacts to UEFA and FIFA, to national selection, to professional football, to performance football for the youth."
"That's not to say I want to do everything alone," Rajchl told <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
“I am a team player and therefore I want to distribute the competencies on the executive committee in such a way that each member is dedicated to a certain area.”
And I’m going to distribute tough tasks so that football advances in every segment with milestones.”
Many would not be delighted about this, because instead of just criticizing the work of others, they would now have to start working really hard themselves," he added.
Due to the critical atmosphere in the football movement has considered not to run at all.
"I know that I work 20 hours a day."
“But I need to know that it makes sense and that people are standing behind me who don’t inevitably throw bumps between my legs and question every step I take,” he said in an explanation of why he hesitated.
“A lot of people told me I shouldn’t give up because otherwise others would too.”
“That’s trust that you can’t gamble on,” he said.
It also allegedly motivates him to continue the work he started under Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“We’ve done a lot of work in two years and I don’t want to just throw that away.”
"Proceedings have been launched, which will only come into effect in a few years and I would only hate to see them stop someone," he said, expressing his concerns that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta was elected, the situation could return to the times before Hasek.
“I believe in systematic approach and that’s something Mirek Pelta doesn’t bring.”
"Behind him are mainly people who would make football so that he would only be there for the elect."
I can be blamed for something, but not for being partisan."
“I try to be objective.”
"I want football for everyone, because then it's good for everyone and not just the chosen ones," Rajchl said.
He also contradicts the claim that he is only a chairman of the Czech Republic.
"Although some people claim the opposite, I really intend to do the best I can for Moravian people."
"For example, it is time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech and a Moravian part, whose winners then rise to the first league."
"Then it could not happen that today only three Moravian clubs play in the league, which is a problem especially for the young players in Moravia," Rajchl says.
Now that the head of the Pilsner club Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k has also joined the fight for the position of chairman, Rajchl does not dare to assess his chances of being elected.
"I feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its deputy chairman and now recognizes that clear successes are behind me," said Rajchl, who also saves tens of millions of kroner for unfavorable contracts, the agreement on television contracts and the deal on the lot.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the fact that the association does not draw on a single strand.
While he says of Pelta that "he is disqualified from the outset to help the Czech football to new confidence", he considers the second rival - Packl<0xC3><0xAD>k as a strong candidate who really has something to offer the football.
"No one can question that he has done excellent work in Pilsen in just one year."
"If he were elected, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek initiated, and obviously he would not fundamentally change the staffing in the commissions as well."
He certainly wouldn’t want to bend things in his favor,” Rajchl said of his rivals.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Jump Into The Blue
by Julia Stanek
Ufo-style paddling pools, pruning pools in Budapest: those who travel through Europe can experience its blue wonder - and after a city tour or hike, the tired legs rest in squirrel baths.
A book shows where well-being in the water is most beautiful.
When Iris Meder went on a research trip in the past one and a half years, one thing in her luggage was not to be missed: her swimsuit.
Leaning back on the water, she looked up into artfully designed domes, swam towards marble pits waiting for her at the edge of the basin, and marveled at meticulously restored Art Nouveau swimming halls.
Liked a bath, she took it up in her notebook - along with knowledgeable details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools explored architectural historian Meder in this way - and now introduces her in her recently published book "Badefreuden": Volksschwimmhallen in Munich, historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
Through 13 countries, she led her "trip to the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe": in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and in each case a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bathing culture enthusiast.
With sport, she doesn't have much to worry about, says Meder - only in the water is different.
Only annoying that swimmers have to settle for blue tiles and chlorine tank, while joggers can breathe in the alluring scent of spruce forests or listen to the cheerful bird whistle in the park.
“One day I wondered why swimming pools have to be so ugly,” says the Meder, who lives in Vienna.
"So I started collecting nice baths."
Water surface doubles the architecture
Slabs in the jumping pool and essential sauna oils - the wellness factor in bathrooms is so great because all the senses are served, according to Meder.
And when the builders have worked hard, swimming halls can be a real eye-catcher: "Instead of a floor, you have a water surface in bathrooms."
"On the one hand, it is transparent, but on the other hand, it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything doubles optically: high vaults, colorful tiles, jumping boards.
The small-format picture book "Badefreuden" conveys on 190 pages valuable information about the architectural and cultural history of historical wellness oases - but above all it makes you want to jump into the blue.
Remarkable specimens were discovered by the pool collector Meder during her research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent healing baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Bath in Budapest, she found a nitrate-containing water in a quaint karst cave (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath, whose basins are filled with alkali-containing water and are located in a bottle-shaped building in J<0xC3><0xA1>rmosy<0xC3><0xA1>l.
Spectacular views, on the other hand, offer many heated outdoor swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria: while you have the whole city in mind from the Zurich rooftop swimming pool, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor swimming pool in St. Anton - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which you can watch the operation on the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design awaits bathers in Längenfeld: The Aquadome <0xC3><0x96>tztal looks like a UFO just landed in the Alps.
From three open bowls it evaporates in winter, while in the background the mountains of the <0xC3><0x96>tztal rise into the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool did the pool collector Meder smell the smell of chlorine in her nose.
Many thermal baths smell of sulphur, in the <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d bath in Békescsaba, Hungary, it smells so strongly of heating oil that it is hardly believed to have landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkaline-hydrogen carbonate-containing healing water, which is almost black and the slick of which sticks to one's skin as soon as one glides into the pelvis - a wellness experience of a special kind.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing spots: when she wanted to visit the outdoor and sunbathing in the Czech bath Luhatschowitz, she found a locked plot of land.
The bathroom, designed by architect Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Jurkovic in 1902, has now been closed.
As Meder glanced through the weathered windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw weeds grow between the tiles.
Counteracting the decay, on the other hand, is a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three phases of construction have already taken place; you can discover not only neo-Romanesque elements dating from the time of its construction in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favorite bath of pool connoisseur Iris Meder - and not only because it originally comes from the Black Forest.
“It’s already an achievement to merge such different building styles into such a great unit,” says Meder.
In such a palace, diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a side effect.
Agro-speculation
Deutsche Bank lets raw material business shine through
by Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank giving up its agricultural raw materials business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the world’s poor.
In January, the CEO then wants to draw consequences.
Hamburg -
According to a study, 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions exit this business because it exacerbates the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on behalf of the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, the author Harald Schumann shows that betting on global commodity exchanges drives prices up – and that’s why the banks share the blame for the global hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is aimed specifically at Deutsche Bank CEO Josef Ackermann, even though large banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, commodity bets were intended to shield traders from price fluctuations.
But by now, most experts agree that the sugars have decoupled from supply and demand – and are making profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike US competitors, Ackermann reacted to the criticism: he promised to examine the allegations and said that no business is "worth putting the good reputation of Deutsche Bank at risk".
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the allegations from the Foodwatch report.
The audit is expected to be completed by the end of the year, and the results will be presented to the Board of Directors of Deutsche Bank - including recommendations on how to deal with them.
At the end of January, the head of the bank will then announce the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the raw material business, or even the complete divestment.
Ackermann crafts with his image
Foodwatch CEO Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but also reiterated his criticism of the financial industry: "Wettes on rising food prices show particularly drastically how recklessly banks are harming the public good today."
Ackermann is now a top bank lobbyist, especially in duty.
“Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio where money is used to bet on food prices,” Bode said.
"Whether Mr. Ackermann is concerned with people suffering from hunger or with the reputation of the Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann’s insight comes as a surprise at first glance, but it is clear that the CEO wants to give a perfect picture a few months before he leaves office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that, unlike planned, the CEO will not move to the Supervisory Board.
By turning away from controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And he hardly needs to shave himself in order to make possible damages - that would eventually have to do with his successor.
One in two people would quit their raw material plants.
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute surveyed 1001 people on November 7 and 8.
Only 11 percent consider it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments that are based on food prices.
Many bank customers would also have personal consequences when they learn that their bank is involved in such transactions: According to the survey, every second would cancel all investments where money flows into commodity speculation.
43% would abort acquaintances from such a bank, 49% said to think about canceling their account and switching to another institution.
21st house in Vienna
The relocated pavilion
Von Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with heights, depths and happy end: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion in Brussels won prizes in 1958, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and empty.
Now it is reopened as an exhibition house.
When warmed by modern post-war architecture, clear forms, glass halls, bold swings and new building materials typical of the belief in technical progress, the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer is a striking and famous example for the Brussels World Exhibition in 1958.
Schwanzer’s pavilion was awarded the Grand Prix d’Architecture for its lightweight and floating steel-glass construction.
The building is still considered to be a milestone in contemporary architecture.
He made the architect so famous that he also built Austria’s pavilion at the next world exhibition.
With his legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus bowl-like side-construction in Munich, he finally became internationally famous in 1973.
Its pavilion, planned as a temporary exhibition building, had been erected after the World Exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the Vienna South Railway Station, rebuilt and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century opened in it - the "20th house" was called it.
However, the building was neither spatially nor technically suitable as a museum - no walls for hanging art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art got a new home in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building was empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has remodeled the pavilion, it is now called "21er Haus" and will be used as a museum for contemporary art in the future.
On Tuesday evening, the Museum Belvedere, to which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition - a lucky one in every respect.
Agnes Husslein-Arco is the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere.
Husslein-Arco, a doctoral art historian with considerable careers, among others in her youth as an ice-artist runner, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Museum der Moderne Salzburg, carried out the conversion with great intensity among politicians and protectors of monuments, and publicly procured funds from them.
Apart from contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba were to be exhibited by the eponymous foundation, there was to be a café and a bookstore, and an office house had to be built for it.
Strict supervision, small state
Krischanitz was then the ideal cast for the performance.
Not only because he had sensitively transformed and expanded Joseph Olbrich’s Secession in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied at Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him an “extremely important place” where he had watched the exhibitions “almost every weekend”.
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which had already lost its generosity and lightness when it was moved to Vienna and reused.
There were far bigger problems with the current renovation: the building was "an energy sling", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade were replaced, glass fiber reinforced insulating glass was used and the glass roof was replaced by special safety glass.
Cold bridge steel supports have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been refurbished.
Two basements provided space for new use, a lowered trench between house and road provides lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house is painted in the old red-brown rust protection hue.
The cinema is exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under the strict supervision of the monument authority and with a small state.
"Often had to be found a material that is good and cheap and also liked the monument protection office," says Krischanitz, pointing to a rugged floor in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and renovations, the building has remained flexible and light.
It would have been difficult with the pavilion that “came from Brussels,” Krishanitz recently said, a typical “drop-in-the-city story.”
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "raise a real awareness".
In this case, however, the 21st house is not in the wrong place, because an urban accident has occurred: around the Swiss garden, the completely newly planned "Hauptbahnhofsquartier", with office and residential buildings, is being created.
And another case of luck may occur: the 21st house could be reinforced by another Krishanitz building, because the collector Francesca of Habsburg has bought the Berlin Temporary Art Hall, and as you hear, she is already negotiating with the city for a neighboring location in the Swiss garden.
Railway Plans Winter Crisis Package in Millions
The railway has developed a crisis plan to prevent train failures in the winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train failures and delays, Deutsche Bahn is spending more than 70 million euros this year, according to a newspaper report.
The "Bild" newspaper reported in advance, citing an internal crisis plan, that by 2015 investments of around 300 million euros were planned.
This aims to achieve better availability of vehicles and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the number of internal and external employees for the removal of snow on railway installations and platforms to 16,000 people.
The goal is to free railway platforms from snow and ice within four to five hours and 90 percent of the required routes.
Two months ago, after a summit with the government and industry, railway chief Rüdiger Grube warned of train failures and delays this winter.
Last winter, the railway had considerable problems in passenger traffic, as it lacked reserves, among other things, in difficult weather conditions.
For example, many new regional trains have been waiting for approval from the Federal Railways Office for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The train has also for years created that it has to test the axes of ICE trains much more often in the workshop, after an ICE at Cologne Central Station had an axle break.
Deutsche Bank Pays Millions of Penalties in U.S.
After the tumult over Chief Josef Ackermann, a new unrest comes from the United States: Deutsche Bank has to pay a million fine there.
As if the problems at home were not enough for Deutsche Bank, the industry giant is now also picking up its past in the US: The Frankfurt Institute pays in a comparison 145 million dollars (106 million euros) to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It is about the sale of mortgage papers.
The financial market regulator NCUA accuses a number of major banks of misleading cooperative banks with false promises to buy the financial products; they have downplayed the risks.
Such papers lost a lot of value during the financial crisis and ripped the banks in the depths.
“We are pleased that we were able to resolve the issue without the parties having to go to court,” a German bank spokesman said in New York.
The bank did not accept any blame for the comparison.
The same applies to the Citigroup, which committed to the payment of $20.5 million.
NCUA Chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the meeting of the two money houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the U.S. co-operative banks and intervenes in bankruptcy to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to get the billion-dollar damages compensated.
The comparisons now made are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also lobbied other major banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland, and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
The mortgage papers in question are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
This is the basis of home loans.
When the U.S. real estate bubble burst in 2007, it became a disaster for a variety of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers flipped.
Even though the events have been going on for several years, there is currently a strong wind blowing against banks in the United States.
Investors and supervisory authorities have sought countless lawsuits to obtain reparation or to penalize wrongdoing.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has unleashed the biggest wave of lawsuits.
She accuses 18 major international banks of overtaking two U.S. state-owned real estate financiers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in mortgage deals worth about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has to file a lawsuit against the FHFA, which involved several transactions worth a total of $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority demands that the Frankfurters stand up for "substantial losses", without, however, mentioning an exact sum.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as baseless and declared that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett to raise $10 billion at IBM
Finance guru Buffett is investing heavily in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has purchased shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far, the big American investor Warren Buffett had always said not to invest in IT and computer companies, as the long-term development of the companies could only be poorly forecast.
Now, however, he has read IBM’s annual reports and changed his mind about investing in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM primarily provides services and procures computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a blow to the financial world.
As a result, the IBM IT milestone can now be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett has revealed on CNBC that he has bought IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
Its investment holding Berkshire Hathaway thus rose to one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a stake of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that not even IBM had known about the commitment so far.
He praised the management, which, even in the economic crisis, had still ensured decent profits.
“They did a great job,” Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has been relying on lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centers for some time now.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful company computers.
Buffett had avoided technology companies until now.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he understands.
Instead, Buffett, for example, approached a freight railway, a lubricant manufacturer or machine builders.
His holding Berkshire Hathaway owns around 80 own subsidiaries and shares in a number of large corporations such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Munich Re.
The 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and expanded it into one of the most valuable companies in the world with smart investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost unmistakable sense of making money has earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha".
After the announcement of the Buffett investment, the IBM stock increased by one percent.
“Big Blue,” as IBM is also called, is worth more than $220 billion on the stock market, making it one of the world’s most valuable technology companies, along with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, he did not want to join.
Bill Gates was a close friend.
The threat is tangible.
After the discovery of the "Zwickau cell", Turkish media have doubts about the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a “bloody ideology” that is now resurrected.
The murders of eight Turkish nationals and a Greek small businessman in the years 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This news is being reacted with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany.
For many German-Turks, this brings back a long-held ghost: since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence against Turks with a right-wing extremist background.
The fact that there is foreign hostility in Germany was never in question.
However, the exposed right-wing extremist network reveals dimensions whose dimension is not yet foreseeable.
"Is the bloody ideology resurrected?" headlined the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, stresses that one of the perpetrators was a V-man of constitutional protection, and is concerned that German authorities could also be involved in the right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted wisely: it reminded the victims of racist violence with a wake-up call at the Brandenburg Gate this weekend.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had contemplating the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In cheerful colors, it had been staged together - as a story of success.
The report of some Turkish media: "Germany's gift to the fiftieth" is the headline of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the background of the series of murders.
Even the German edition of the "Hürriyet" cannot afford to draw this mental connection.
"It's starting to stink," is the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
He emphasizes that people have been murdered, that taxes have been paid and that their work has made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
In German-Turkish Internet forums, the actions of the police and their subsequent success are discussed critically.
The authors wonder why the German authorities were not much more likely to search for suspects in right-wing extremist circles.
Some are at least rhetorically ready for drastic means: "If we continue to be sloppy here, the migrants will have nothing left but self-defense and armament."
"This will probably be the best self-protection".
"On the goodness of the enlightenment and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network depends very much the inner peace in Germany," writes "Selen".
What it means when the internal peace in Germany is in jeopardy is illustrated by the attacks by Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photo of the Solingen fire ruins is deeply rooted in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event made it clearer to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans that distrust and distance can result in right-wing violence.
The attacks, however, sharpened the feeling of being on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press, the failure of German politics after the attacks was particularly criticized: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the Solingen fire attack, he sent a condolence telegram to the Turkish president, but at the funeral in Cologne he was represented by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel then counted in his speech how many taxes the local Turks paid.
It’s like a person’s value is calculated by the amount of their taxes.
The current reporting by the Turkish media shows once again how deep the distrust of many German Turks in the domestic rule of law has been ever since.
In addition to the efforts of a comprehensive clarification and reevaluation of right-wing terrorism in Germany, this time open words are needed.
The Scandal Bank of Lake Zurich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since climbed from one crisis to the next.
Now let a German judge.
Axel Weber certainly didn’t think so.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank, it was announced in July that he would be taking on an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Swiss Großbank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber rejoiced publicly, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidity and dropped friendly remarks about future colleagues.
"The UBS has made the turnaround".
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
But in September, it became clear that everything was going to be different.
A UBS dealer in London had bypassed all of the bank’s hedging systems and squandered around 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a banker not only famous in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the chairman of the board of directors of UBS has also been considered a hit – and everyone is asking: When will Axel Weber finally arrive?
It has already been announced that Weber will be allowed to advise the bank from February 2012.
And he will take over the chairmanship of the Board of Directors as early as May - not until 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
This is going to be tough for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, but rather a professor of economics and a central banker, and would certainly have needed a period of processing.
With a stroke, he then takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proven once again that it has long earned the title of "biggest scandal bank in Europe".
Because UBS is huge on the one hand - until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world - and on the other hand it has been climbing from one scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, remains the once so proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the hidden and solid, but also sophisticated Swiss asset manager had combined her with ambitious goals: she also wanted to become a very large number in investment banking.
In 2007, UBS managed $1.6 trillion more cash-rich customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, as an investment bank, it was ahead of the league of the world’s largest banks.
That made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and later long-time banking professor in Zurich, says: “I always set the UBS as a model for my students at that time.”
“From today’s perspective, you ask yourself, ‘How could I be so wrong?’
He made a big mistake.
In 2007, it became apparent for the first time that something really went wrong at UBS.
In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Wuffli surprisingly resigned, who until then was considered a highly intellectual and equally brilliant banker.
A few months later, he knew why he had left.
The bank’s investment stake had been cluttered with subprime papers and had to write off billions.
To shoulder this, UBS announced a capital increase in the amount of CHF 13 billion.
In fact, she found investors, but some of them, some of whom until recently would have nodded their heads: an opaque Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund that was so silent that one did not even know its name.
But that was only the first blow.
It got worse in April 2008.
The bank had to announce new billions in losses, with Marcel Ospel, chairman of the board of directors, still the second best-paid board of directors in Switzerland, resigning in 2006.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: UBS faced the collapse and had to be rescued by the state in the face of its misinvestments in the financial crisis.
The National Bank bought out UBS for tens of billions of troubled securities, while the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a forced convertible bond, through which it could become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - because it noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it hosts such large banks.
Finally, the balance sheet total of UBS 2007 was more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see graph).
“Once again, we could not save UBS,” says bank researcher Geiger.
The first disaster was followed by the second.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with America and agreed to release the data of wealthy customers who may have been taxed with the help of the bank.
In addition, she agreed to a payment of $780 million - as a repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions, including a penalty charge.
As a result, UBS was more or less open to helping with tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in the competition for rich customers: the nimbus of secrecy.
After the scandal, the Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customer money.
Within a few months, the bank had lost its credibility in both core business areas: in investment banking through mis speculation and in asset management through tax evasion assistance.
And just as it got a little quieter again, just as you thought UBS would get it back, here’s this nasty trader story: A single trader squandered 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed that something was going wrong.
And it becomes obvious: with risk management in investment banking, it obviously still does not work.
"With the Adoboli case, one has to find that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and professor of finance at the Bank Institute of the University of Zurich.
The chief financial officer of a large German bank is also sure: "The problem with UBS is that it does not have control over risk."
It was precisely the idea of the caution with which the Swiss bankers had long ago set out to become guardians of the great wealth of the world: not too great a risk, security for money - even beyond the Alpine Republic the world might once collapse.
The safes of the Swiss banks had become a symbol of unwavering reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly noble chocolate.
The headquarters of UBS in Zurich still fits the cliché of the well-developed Swiss private bank - it is only a little larger.
The situation is already classic.
The bank is headquartered on Zurich’s Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly from the main station to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are splendid, the store rents are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellery such as Tiffany's can be found here among Swiss traditional shops such as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
Swiss banks have resided here for centuries: from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
You enter the reception hall of the UBS through a heavy turning door.
Inside, the walls are decorated with marble, in front of which there are thick leather armchairs, next to the bank logo a large sign for the "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has been repressed by both Swiss major banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but at some point – or betrayed, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all, like all Swiss bankers, he does business with the two big banks.
The UBS has become much too big, he finds - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons had also spread.
The Swiss have nothing more to say.
"And if so, they have long adapted to the customs of the angelic axes."
In fact, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, first gave it high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the Subprime jungle as the Swiss Grand Bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster became visible.
"That Wednesday, the government coalition of the small country of seven million decided the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," author Lukas Hässig writes in his book "The UBS crash".
Up to 68 billion francs, or around 45 billion euros, the politicians granted to save the big bank facing bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged into a large group.
A bank was created, which was already too big for the small Switzerland at the time of the merger - and it kept growing.
The two different predecessor banks of UBS helped to complement each other: a rich but sleepy bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer but already more internationalized one.
All of a sudden, the internationalized investment bankers came up with a lot of money, with which they could spin a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team,” says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the belly man who has worked up from banking to the top."
But Ospel ultimately relied on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a crucial mistake in the end: "He thought his models were the reality," says Geiger.
“This is a tragic case.”
Tragic, maybe.
It is clear that pride came before the fall.
Employees of UBS clearly remember the executive meetings at which CEO Wuffli repeatedly issued the same slogan: Goldman Sachs is knocking off the throne.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She led the "League Tables", the rankings that documented the success of the banks of that time.
That's where the UBS wanted to go, all the way up.
She had already taken a few steps.
In the foreign exchange business and in the stock trading, she played at the top.
However, company consultants who were commissioned highlighted a weakness: in the international interest rate business, in the banking language "Fixed Income", there is a huge distance to the largest banks.
UBS has gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that almost cost them their lives.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and a pre-founded hedge fund invested in American subprime investments.
It developed into a huge machine that packaged and distributed securities on American mortgage loans – but also kept risks.
Even when other banks have long been looking for the exit.
“Even in the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was in flames, UBS bought there,” says banking expert Geiger.
So great the euphoria, so deep the case.
One manager after another had to go, as attempts to clean up turned out to be more difficult than expected.
Posts at UBS have become the headquarter of Schleuderer and are still volatile.
Whoever runs the big bank now has an almost impossible job.
He has to find a strategy for a bank that has missed all the obvious business models.
Banking researcher Geiger already has an idea: Stop investment banking, focus on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank does not (yet) want to go that far.
But investment banking is supposed to shrink sharply, so much is already clear.
On Thursday, the new bank manager Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was actually only intended as a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly separated from its predecessor, Grübel.
In the meantime, he has asserted that he is to conduct the business of UBS permanently, the Zurich Bank announced on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants the investment bank to go back to the mid-1990s.
He has 3,500 jobs.
But that will not suffice.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money from?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is probably asking himself right now.
So far, he has only said publicly that he and his wife will be looking for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on U.S. stock market
The impending recession in Europe has taken the courage of U.S. investors at the start of the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained without impact.
The throttling of industrial production on the continent suffocated the hopes of stabilizing the debt crisis in the germ.
The general relief of the change of government in Rome and Athens could not prevail.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass was still half-full last week, not half-empty – but now the problems were again pressing in the foreground, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
Above all, financial values were on the sales slips.
The Dow Jones Index of Standard Values was down 0.6 percent at 12,078 points at the close of trading.
In the course of trading, the market barometer fluctuated between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
The broader S&P-500 index closed at 1,251 points, a minus of one percent.
The Nasdaq Technology Stock Exchange index lost 0.8 percent and exited trading with 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax passed with a minus of 1.2 percent at 5985 counters.
The industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced its production and is preparing for the end of the recovery.
The companies produced two percent less in September than in the previous month, according to Eurostat.
US investors were skeptical: “We are not an island, but dependent,” said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to get out of a recession so quickly, and there are other signs of weakness in the banks.
Investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: It is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do anything to end the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
In his view, it is too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a decades-old principle over the heap and entered the U.S. technology industry.
Its investment of more than $10 billion in IBM supported the stock price of the traditional group and made it almost one percent higher compared to the trend in the course of trading.
The paper closed almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffett has paid an average of $170 a piece and now holds 5.5 percent.
The share price of its investment firm Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3%.
Bank of America’s shares were significantly stronger than the market at 2.6 percent.
The company will sell almost all of its shares in the China Construction Bank and withdraw $6.6 billion.
With the net profit from the business, the Institute wants to boost its capital ratio and thus comply with tougher regulatory requirements.
The aircraft manufacturer Boeing added up and thus limited the losses in the Dow.
The share gained 1.5 percent after the group had collected the largest order in its history.
Airline Emirates ordered 50 long-haul 777s on Sunday and quantified the value of the order at $18 billion.
Including options for 20 more machines, the volume is even $26 billion.
On the New York Stock Exchange, around 710 million shares were exchanged.
719 values added, 2,281 yielded and 79 remained unchanged.
At the Nasdaq, with sales of 1.38 billion shares, 630 shares closed in the plus, 1913 in the minus and 82 unchanged.
Smart crows are spreading in cities
In many places, seed crows are considered "problem birds": But from the cities, the highly intelligent animals can no longer be driven, experts claim.
Some people like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly: crows have been part of the cityscape for centuries, but in many municipalities, residents complain about the dirt and noise of the animals.
A remedy against the "problem birds" is not yet in sight.
Seed crows are no longer to be obtained from the cities, experts said at the first crow symposium in the East Frisian void.
There, experts from all over the federal territory consulted on possible solutions.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
Conservationists also attributed the problems in cities to the exodus of specially protected seed crows: the use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional habitats.
The hunting, increasing settlement and the fall of typical brood trees made life difficult for the birds.
Crows are protected by nature.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in the Westphalian Soest, in the north-west, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There, in 2005, a controversial project for the mass killing of crows in the county provided negative headlines.
Critics had described the capture of the animals in bird traps and the killing with knuckles as particularly brutal.
"The normal expulsion, the embezzlement, brings nothing," said the city and landscape planner Werner Klöver.
Spraying nests with water or falling trees often have undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals diverge, large colonies split up and spread elsewhere."
Harassment is only conceivable as an exception to hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
“We have to live with them, we can’t get them away.”
Without the surrounding area, the problem cannot be solved in the cities, said the mayor Wolfgang Kellner from empty.
A combination of germination of the animals from sensitive living areas and lock offers to resettle them in other places is conceivable.
The psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens, on the other hand, advocated for a completely different treatment of the animals: "One pimple in the face we can finally tolerate with confidence."
In Schleswig-Holstein, Jürgens had co-founded the Ascheberger Krähen-Lehrpfad, where signs inform about the lives of highly intelligent seed crows.
The project is already being accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also had his own opinion on the criticism of the noise of birds: "There is a lot of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: seed crows not only use tools to get to a treat, but even make their own tools as tools.
Behavioral researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested four seed crows on how far the birds’ intelligence reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they must use stones to bring a scaffold to collapse in order to reach a moth larva.
Without much training, they purposefully recognized what size and shape a stone must have in order for the platform to collapse.
In a second attempt, the clever crows then had to solve a more tricky problem.
In a vertical cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a moth larva.
With the beak the birds could not reach their prey.
However, the researchers had laid wire pieces on them.
From this all four animals formed a hook, with the help of which they then fished the bucket on the handle from the tube.
Three of the four seed crows even managed to do this at once.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal at the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks for a coup remained.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and also Ireland will be at the 2012 European Championships.
In the playoffs, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland settled the last tickets to the 2012 European Championships in Poland and Ukraine.
Led by twice-successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made it perfect after the 0:0 draw for the fifth consecutive European Championship.
The Czechs scored a 1:0 (0:0) in the play-off back match against outsider Montenegro, after the previous game (2:0) had already been a clear thing.
There was nothing more to burn Croatia in the 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland got a loose 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the other goals for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a converted trading meter (41.) and captain Emir Spahic (65.) had shortened twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia had already failed Portugal in the play-offs at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal took a bespoke start.
Ronaldo chased a free kick from about 30 meters to early lead into the nets.
A good quarter-hour later, Nani showed his wide-shooting qualities and hit from 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half hour, had their first clear chance by goalkeeper Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburger of the English leader Manchester City put a header at the bottom of the bat, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33.).
Jiracek meets for Czech Republic
Subsequently, referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding was in the spotlight.
After an attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penalty area, Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36th).
On the other hand, Stark gave a controversial trading meter after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which Misimovic surely transformed.
But after the break, the 2004 Vice-European Champion cleared everything with four hits.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek finished the 81st minute with his last doubts.
This is the fifth time that the 1976 European Championship has been held in a row.
However, the team of coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) was also lucky and had to survive a moment of horror in the initial phase.
Finalist Petr Cech prevented a possible goal at the last moment with a reflex by Tomas Sivok (9th).
Montenegro had its best chances when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot just past the goal of Cech in the 40th minute from the corner of the penalty area.
After the break, the crossbar had to save for the already beaten world-class goalkeeper of the Czechs, again the striker of FC Seoul had withdrawn (50th).
The gate just before the end made everything clear.
Turkey, meanwhile, missed the football miracle of Zagreb.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not get beyond a 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink has almost certainly to clear his place on the bench of the World Cup third of 2002, the Croatians can look forward to their fourth participation in a final round of the European Championships.
In front of 31,000 spectators at Maksimir Stadium, the Turks had almost caught a dream start.
Selcuk Inan hit in the seventh minute with a distance shot only the post, attacker Kazim Kazim could not even sink the striker in the goal.
After a moment of horror, however, Croatia took more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croats did not let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who made a place for Dortmunder Ivan Perisic from the 62nd minute, the Bundesliga legionaries Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in service.
Trapattoni goes to the European Championships
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated the first European Championships in Germany since 1988.
Stephen Ward led the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a pre-decision in the 32nd minute with the 4-0 success in the run-up.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) equaled for the guests.
Ireland pushed from the start to the pace, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only at the last moment did the Estonian rear team prevent the possible leader hit.
In the 32nd minute, that was it.
After an accidental defense by finalist Pavel Londak, Ward was on the spot and pushed the ball to 1-0 over the line.

As the police reported, a local resident noticed the fire at midnight and at the same time watched two dark-clad men fleeing over the adjacent cemetery wall in the Steegerstraße.
The alarmed firefighter was able to extinguish the fire quickly.
Hungry Labrador Turns On Stove - Home Fire
A hungry dog has probably set off a house fire in Brandenburg/Havel.
The Labrador probably jumped on the stove to get food, police said on Friday.
He must have moved the switch and switched on a plate.
Paper on the stove caught fire.
The apartment on the fourth floor of a multi-family house was set on fire on Thursday afternoon.
The dog died of a flue gas poisoning.
The 18-year-old tenant, who was not in the apartment during the fire, is being investigated for negligent arson.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe’s largest software manufacturer SAP is investing billions in China over the next few years and wants to almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, about two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) are expected to flow, the Dax Group announced on Tuesday.
“We will create additional research and development facilities and recruit staff accordingly,” Co-Chef Bill McDermott announced at a customer fair in Beijing.
The workforce is expected to grow from about 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the world leader in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
Around 4,000 of the world’s more than 176,000 SAP customers are located in the boomland.
The growth plans in China are also an important building block of the Dax Group’s 2015 strategy.
SAP aims to increase sales to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion by 2015.
Last year, the Walldorfers had redeemed around 12.5 billion euros.
Currently, the business of the software provider, which employs 55,000 people worldwide, is running almost never before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
“Now we want to expand our activities (...),” McDermott said.
“Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive education.”
Mass slaughter on a personal level
Embarrassed and generous, Peter Englund's new book "Beauty and Horror: A First World War Story told in Nineteen Destinies" begins with a long list of main characters that goes to one's heart.
Here’s a tip on how to proceed: Cut this page out carefully and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people very well in Englund's novel narrative, and these main characters will function as your GPS, as a lighthouse in these few moments when you are lost like Englund's men and women in the fog of war and deprived of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He has written an unusual book that he does not describe inaccurately as "a work of anti-history".
It contains only a few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly any ambassadors, angry reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was." It is about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and horror" almost summed up the war experiences of 20 more or less inconspicuous men and women on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, get mad, or die.
Each of these lives flares up like the votive candles in a church, some coming in while others go out.
Englund's book differs from the usual history books.
It also corrects the notion that the First World War was only the devastating position war on the Western Front.
"Beauty and horror" wanders with expert views over other war scenes: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
On the soldiers in this book fall beehives, one celebrates Christmas among the pyramids in Egypt, Tsets fly are an insoluble problem.
This is almost from the beginning a moving book.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina that smells of Kordit.
Imagine that you are a woman who is at home with her children and hears gunfire in the distance. Do you stay or take the flight?
Who's coming?
Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war is being waged at all.
“Failed facts,” says Englund, “were furnished with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors.”
"Beauty and Horror" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German ship sailor.
Their stories were mainly taken from memories, letters and other material already published.
Their life stories can be frightening or gripping, but they are extremely vivid in Englund’s collection of small moments that lose in detail.
Many of them act out of want and help themselves.
In the story of a German schoolgirl, he tells: "Replace, everywhere replace."
"Replacement coffee, false aluminum, false eraser, paper associations, wooden buttons."
He talks more about substitute food in Germany.
He describes "meat made from pressed rice and baked in ham fat (and most recently served with a false wooden bone), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato bowls, shoes that were stuffed with wood."
There were, as he noted, "837 registered food substitutes allowed in the manufacture of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
An American recognizes his own urge for savagery and says about the war: "One feels that in spite of everything, this is what was intended for men rather than sitting in the armchair, with the evening sheet or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in hand, and so to do as a gesture does not imply such a fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade of barge civilization and barge it.
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is likely to die and no one will take note of it or take care of it.
“When you distance yourself from the thought of sacrificing yourself, you want to think that this is happening in front of an audience,” he writes.
Instead, it’s as terrible as “a condemned man hung in secret.”
Other observations relate to the disintegrating old Europe and new forms of terror.
"The conflict became increasingly an economic rivalry," writes Englund, "a war between the factories."
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the still young century": "the word-turned and ideologically convinced mass murderers in the suit who slaughter while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in an unpredictable way and there is just as frivolous behavior as heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers who actively tried to infect a prostitute with a sexually transmitted disease in order to escape the frontline service.
"The grotesque expression of this can be discovered in the trade with gonokokken eggs, because soldiers bought and smeared themselves on their genitals, hoping to get into the hospital like this," he writes.
"Those who were really desperate rubbed him in the eyes, which led to them being blind for the rest of their lives."
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund’s poetry becomes smooth and yet unobtrusive and adapts perfectly to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he captures the way the war "uniquely unleashed uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are taking them to battle.
The best books about the First World War were mostly more falsified like Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarque's "Im Westen nichts Neues" than extensive history books.
Englund’s band joins an unconventional Hall of Fame.
His book has the most devastating ending I have ever read in a nonfiction book.
I don't give it away anymore.
But it’s as if he’d snatched us this page with the main characters in front of us with his book and lit us with a match.
After an early failure, a meticulously planned assault
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing helmets.
It was decided for the night from Monday to Tuesday, because at that time there are hardly any people in Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-ranking officials were informed; all the others believed at first to participate in an exercise.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was among them and his presence underscored the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The incidents of the past weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violated the rules of the caesarean section and gave the occupiers an enormous increase in public sympathies, were not allowed to repeat themselves.
And so the police action to remove the protesters from the Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared these by observing how occupations were handled in other cities.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a view of Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officials reinforced the so-called chaos training — counter-terrorism measures, including the rapid deployment of a large number of police officers — to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session took place on Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to move into the park came “at the last minute,” said someone familiar with the orders, which referred to a declaration as “exercise.”
“The few policemen involved, to my knowledge, didn’t know it was about Zuccotti Park,” said someone who wanted to remain anonymous.
"The only ones who knew it was about Zuccotti Park were the high-ranking officials of the resort."
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson the city had learned.
On October 14, officials wanted to clear the park, but then retreated when hundreds of protesters gathered after they learned of these plans.
Officers from various police units were involved in the operation on Tuesday, including commandos from all over the city - hundreds of mobile officers, who are usually deployed in highly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day many people enter and exit the park, almost like commuters, so 1 o’clock at night is a good time to go in.
“It was appropriate to do this when the least number of people are in the park,” he said.
Rescue vehicles with Jupiter lamps and loudspeakers were ready to depart at Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the pre-recorded messages roaring from the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
When the public officials entered the park in their light blue wind jackets, many protesters simply gathered their belongings and left the place.
Police said no tents would be touched until 1:45 a.m. to give protesters time to pack up their belongings.
Other teams of officials were seen gathering in the area to intervene should arrests in the park become necessary.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, the police president’s spokesman, said this was done for their own safety.
But many journalists claim that they wanted to keep them from watching the police operations in the park, and they said the handling of the officials was very harsh.
Mr. Browne said that TV cars on Church Street on the west side of the park could have taken photos.
As the police moved westwards due to the large confusion over the protesters’ personal belongings, including suitcases, artificial turf and bags of clothes, their city cleaners followed, picking up what had been left behind.
Some protestors who refused to leave were dragged outside, images of which appeared on the Internet a short time later.
A main core of protesters was located near the kitchen area of the camp in the center of the park.
Some barriers were erected and the police continued their methodical arrests.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp banded together at their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Disaster protection officials were called in to cut them off.
As Mr Kelly said, no arrests were made in the park until around 3:30 p.m.
According to police, the escape was completed after 75 minutes.
Browne said 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests came, he said, due to "irregular behavior and resistance to arrest".
The most prominent local official was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformed officer of the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of the Department of Criminal Officers, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly "did not lead the operation," as Mr. Browne said.
In case they were to access, a second group of officials were waiting on the east side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
Barricades were erected in Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and Pine Street, a block further south.
It was possible to observe how the circumference around Zuccotti Park was expanding from these locations.
In one place, several officials, many of them with shields, were observed driving people out.
About 28 people were in the northern periphery.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., a protester jumped on the roof of a police vehicle south of Pine Street, and other demonstrators let the air out of the tire of a police bus.
In one place, the crowd threw a piece of plywood.
In the end, an official and a protester came to the hospital.
The union of guardians will file a lawsuit against the city for dismissals
The union, which represents hundreds of school administrators who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday as the layoffs are unnecessary and discriminatory due to their inappropriate influence on schools that teach poor students.
The lawsuit is probably the last option still open to the union, District Council 37, in its efforts to reverse the dismissals.
Six hundred and twenty-seven school assistants, care coordinators and other employees who were among the lowest-paid employees in the city and had lost their jobs on October 7 in a chess move described the union leader as political revenge for the fact that in the past year the city was denied access to a health fund, the work groups were denied access to the health fund, the work groups were denied access to
This accusation was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a city council hearing last month, Dennis M. Walcott, director of schools, said the layoffs were part of the budget that was passed in June.
A member of the city council fired back and told him that there was nothing in the budget to specify that school aid workers would be fired.
City Council 37 officials said they had and warned the education ministry of a lawsuit. On Wednesday, there will be a press conference at which the filing of the lawsuit before the Supreme Court in Manhattan will be formally announced.
The lawsuit will list Mr. Walcott and the City’s Department of Education as defendants and count eight dismissed workers as plaintiffs, all of whom are colored or Latino women, like most of the helpers who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s Justice Department, said the city did not file the lawsuit and could not comment on its individual allegations.
According to a draft complaint submitted to the New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs at schools in the city’s poor neighborhoods to support a lawsuit over inequality, claiming that poor schools have lost more helpers as they are chronically underfunded.
She explains that while there were no layoffs on Staten Island and few layoffs in Upper East Side or TriBeCa schools, 17 school helpers in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 helpers in Districts 8 and 9 were laid off in the South Bronx.
With the finding of the loss of five out of eight school assistants employed at 36 Harlem Public Schools, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit states: "This is not a neighborhood of caring parents who can organize donations to catch budget cuts."
P.S.: The budget of the 36th district was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and money was lost when the city changed its calculation method for extra funding for each Armenian school enrollment.
The union also complains that the heads of high schools were misled by the language in a memo that approved the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even though "excess" in the U.S. usually describes the change of a teacher from a school's payroll to a pool of available workers who are paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six care coordinators were dismissed, not handed over," the draft complaint says.
Mission ended, Congress ready to agree on Libya
In the end, it looks as if Republicans and Democrats in Washington are already agreeing on the uprisings in Libya.
All that was needed was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate’s International Relations Committee passed a resolution subjecting President John Kerry (Massachusetts), along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), calling on Libya for the successful rebellion and the U.S. troops for their “mute.”
“This resolution honors the courageous people of Libya who have begun rebuilding their country,” Kerry said.
"It is a confirmation of the support of their democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in the Libyan debate.
This summer, legislators from both parties and the White House are arguing over the wording of a series of resolutions approving or disapproving the role of the US military in NATO’s Libyan mission.
In June, Kerry and McCain tabled a resolution approving the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected in the Senate by a broad fringe group of both parties and there was no vote.
But on the same day, the law passed in the Senate, and the House passed a decision to cut funding for American operations in Libya.
As a result, the U.S. mission fell into a kind of legislative bonfire – with a Congress that was outraged enough to criticize Obama’s actions as part of the mission, but not angry enough to finally pull the ground under his feet.
Then the indecision of the Congress was overtaken by the events.
Tripoli fell to Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
The Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution “congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary endurance in their self-liberation” and “praises the men and women of the U.S. military and their coalition partners who support the military operations to protect the people of Libya, for their extraordinary courage and professionalism.”
The resolution also reaffirms “the national interests of the United States in a successful and irrevocable transition of Libya to democracy.”
Will the new measures receive the full support of the Foreign Relations Committee or will they divide the legislators, as the June law did?
The last version encounters resistance from Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the committee's top Republican.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to the Capitol, it is up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment that calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every congressional legislature period of Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures under the leadership of Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or any other area currently coming to a vote in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far tried unsuccessfully to put their amendments to the vote, although they have tried often enough.
Goodlatte’s amendment is just one of 68 constitutional amendments submitted to this Congress and covers a whole range of topics.
Some are double - the same law was submitted to both Congress and the Senate - others only slightly deviate from each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the balance sheet change in the Senate alone and another dozen that would “control federal spending.”
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their clients—especially novice Republicans who want to polish their resumes—the opportunity to boast that they have “composed” such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, passed in August, requires both the Senate and Congress to vote on a change to the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted for a non-binding resolution that supports the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of Congress can submit, while Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to lift the two-term limit of the president.
Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments that, among other things, guarantee the right to good education and health care.
A change that prohibits same-sex marriage is like a change that prohibits the burning of flags, a recurring theme.
Some legislators also want to allow federal laws to be repealed if two-thirds of states reject them.
As zealous as the members propose changes, so unevenly moving faster than in previous years.
At the 111th Congress, legislators introduced 77 such amendments. at the 110th Congress 66.
The pace is fading compared to that of the early 1990s, in which members regularly proposed more than 150 changes every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to Congress as early as 1789.
"Affected but not defeated," Giffords said in the first television interview after the attack
Ten months after an armed man shot at her from close range during an election rally in Tucson, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared on national television Monday night. She sang alone to the Broadway play "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said the desire to return was greater.
When she appeared along with Diane Sawyer in the ABC news "20/20", she ran for words and needed help walking.
The show showed the severe slow recovery from the damage done by the bullet that split her skull, pierced the left side of her brain, and crossed her head from front to back.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to Congress to triumphantly cast her vote for the debt brake.
In her first television interview after the January attack, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Gifford smiled, laughed, and sang — and described her recovery as “difficult.”
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford (41) replied, “Very well.”
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20/20" special that was recorded just before the couple's new book was published: "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope."
The special follows Gifford's recovery since the January 8 assassination.
In videos that Kelly had recorded in the first few weeks, she is seen in the hospital bed, with her head shaved and a long scarf over her forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair while therapists show her how to perform simple movements.
A nod with the head.
A squeak with the lips.
And then, her first words: "What."
After a few days, Giffords whispers another word: "Toast." She wants her breakfast changed.
Videos played on the ABC show show show that music played an important role in Gifford's recovery: You can see the congresswomen singing along with the therapists to Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and to Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'".
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours a day on therapy, said she could not remember the day of the attack.
Her husband said he had read to Giffords on March 12 an article in a daily newspaper about the attack when she interrupted him and asked for the first time about the six people who had been killed during the attack.
Suspected shooter Jared Lee Loughner sits in a Missouri prison and is forcibly treated while waiting for his trial.
“Many people have died,” Giffords told Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
In the course of his wife’s recovery, Kelly told Sawyer, she said, “I was hit.”
“So, I’d say, ‘Gabby, you weren’t defeated,’” Kelly said.
You were just hit.
And you're going to get through this and you're going to recover and you're going to come back stronger than ever before.
Troops are more sympathetic than respectful
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
A hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines gathered around him.
The crowd in black tuxedos stood up and applauded.
“The soldiers were seen as heroes,” said David Saltzman, who organized the campaign in the spring.
A high-ranking military officer at the gala, who was observed, among other things, by the Chief of Staff and then Chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
“They were introduced like orphans,” the officer wrote in an email.
I’m sure the organizers meant it well.
I know that.
But it was no respect, really not. It was pity.
The sharply contradictory impressions illustrate the serious relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admired American public.
Troops are being rewarded for their sacrifices.
But praise has its price, officials say.
The public is increasingly acting as if you are suffering people in uniform.
“We were by no means victims,” said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
“But apparently the only way to support is to push ourselves into the role of unhappy souls.”
The issue is extremely sensitive to military leaders who want to appear not ungrateful or at odds with the public they serve.
They also realized that the anger that struck the returning troops in the last years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, conversations about compassion in silence and in private between war veterans take place.
After his two sons returned from battles with the Marines, Colonel a.D. Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would view them with a sense of awe as they had defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if an “enraged, violent veteran is hiding beneath the surface,” said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and assumed a high-ranking state post in Washington upon his return.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the respondents subtly asked if he was able to withstand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington as soon as he returned from the fight.
"When you talk about your service, you have to keep the negative impressions against it," Cancian told his sons.
The lack of ease of the military is partly rooted in the lack of interest of the Americans in the war.
Achievements on the battlefield are rarely hailed as praise by a country that has little experience with the military and sees little use in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“We as a nation no longer value military heroism as it was absolutely customary in World War II,” said Lieutenant General David Barno a.D., who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public largely focuses on the suffering of a service member.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or for the severity of their injuries.
Military Faces Growing Pressure to Harden in Rape
This week, an important hearing will decide whether 28 women and men will be charged with non-interference in a rape case before the military court.
If it does not happen, hundreds of plaintiffs are ready for the next hearing.
Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant when she was raped by a fellow soldier at night.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague carrying a 12-pack of beer.
He asked if he could accompany her to her room for a drink.
"My alarm bells went on," Lyman said.
But the Texan woman put her concerns aside.
I thought, "Oh, he's 19.
“He’s from Texas,” she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my gut feeling."
A few minutes after they had gone to Lyman’s room, the man stepped behind her, pushed her down and raped her, she claims.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military employees are anxiously awaiting a trial with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, that will decide whether a lawsuit they filed against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be admissible in court.
The lawsuit claims that Gates and Rumsfeld did not act against the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February, filed by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the lawsuit initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but in the following months it rose to 28: 25 women and three men, all of whom claim to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers, and that the military failed to provide a warrant to prosecute or prosecute.
Burke says she is pursuing the top military leadership as the problem begins there.
"The military is hierarchically built," she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in a position to eradicate the culture's vengeance? The leadership."
Burke also says she has contacted nearly 400 more survivors since February, many of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
Their strategy: Instead of all the plaintiffs putting their eggs in a basket, they will, if necessary, file many more lawsuits to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, led by State Attorney Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit.
The court files available to Newsweek detail the defense strategy, primarily that the military cannot be indicted by current or former soldiers for injuries it has sustained in the armed forces.
Under a 1950 Supreme Court law, the so-called Feres doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries inflicted on active-duty soldiers.
"The alleged damages occurred during the military service of the plaintiffs," the document says.
The Department of Defense refuses to comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in combat, the only difference lies in the name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
Teams of soldiers are playing increasingly important roles in both Iraq and Afghanistan, especially in contact with indigenous women in the war zones.
The result: between these two wars, 150 soldiers died, two-thirds of them in combat.
It is time for the military to be modernized, Burke says.
And she is not alone in her struggle: three other lawsuits besides her are pending.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a female-hostile atmosphere.
Independently of this, the non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America is filing a lawsuit against the military, focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disorder" that rape victims received in order to dismiss them from service - a common practice according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Network A's
Her group filed a lawsuit against the Veterans Administration in December, accusing it of discriminatory practices in its handling of service claims for persons alleged to have been sexually abused in service.
Nine bills were independently submitted to Congress by a mix of senators and representatives of both parties, providing a number of clues.
According to the Department of Defense’s Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, 3,158 sexual abuse cases were reported in 2010.
However, most abuses are not reported at all, and according to the Pentagon’s own estimate, this figure takes into account about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occur per year.
The report, which was published in March, also examines law enforcement rates: in 2010, 20 percent of recorded cases in the military went to court, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke’s case describe their attacks as only the first of a series of dreams.
In Lyman’s case, she reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the assault.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape to a whole range of police officers, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape kit and the blood of her attacker, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge and asked about the sex she had with her boyfriend before the assault.
Six persons testified as character witnesses in the name of the alleged perpetrator, who was ultimately acquitted.
“I still remember the day the verdict was read,” Lyman said.
"I thought the weepers were about to start, and I ran screaming out of the courtroom."
"They took me to the psychiatric ward and I remember when I came out again, I said to my commander, 'This wasn't his procedure, this was my procedure.'"
Lyman was asked to see a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder and declared it incapable of service.
In January 2010, she was dishonorably discharged, so she received no support whatsoever.
Whether the lawsuit that Lyman and the other plaintiffs have filed advances is pure speculation, says John Turley, a professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
Still, he notes, "In my opinion, they should move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first questioned.
I am a critic of the Feres doctrine.
The military lags a decade behind, because they do not have the same incentive and deterrence that liability entails.
He adds, “The odds are against them... but it’s important for them to try.”
These things will only change if good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not follow their path, Burke, the plaintiff’s attorney, will start with her hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
“We will continue to fight the military in this regard until there is reform,” she says.
Or until we die, whichever comes first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Watch You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many guys who sent their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who confessed to having committed an amok run in Norway in July, killing 77 people, had his first public hearing in court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time before his attack on his computer and chatted with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing extremist groups on social networking sites.
After the tragedy this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
It’s easy – you just have to log in to Facebook.
“We found that it wasn’t hard to get to them,” says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report by the UK’s DEMOS Ideas Factory on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook’s hiding of personal data is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says, that researchers simply need to use the site’s advertising tool to accurately pinpoint their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy — just as marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million fans of far-right groups across Europe and then targeted them with Adds, but instead of linking to a new band or a new diet product, the Adds invited users to a survey that asked them about their educational status, their attitude to violence, and their assessment of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 supporters of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries – without having to leave their office even once.
“It’s a fairly new research method,” Bartlett says.
Some of the results hardly surprise. Online promoters of right-wing extremist groups are usually young, male, and angry about immigration.
But in a kind of surprising twist, “those who combine their online activism with an offline activism are more reasonable, democratic, and less violent than those who sit behind their computer screens.”
DEMO’s work is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Idea factories, medical researchers, and political scientists use the site to study everything from health issues to societal trends such as likes, text messages, and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding on average three content a day, Facebook’s “data supernova” is generating a research boom that has increased the number of scientific papers titled this page by nearly 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that you can study through this site people you don’t usually reach with your clipboard on the street.
"When you tried to interview people of the British National Party in the past, it was very difficult to identify them."
“They had to inform the party first and it would never have granted them access,” Bartlett said.
“With Facebook, it all falls away – you go straight to them.”
Others say that the site offers a way to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues has found that students who discussed their full-blown rage on Facebook are significantly more likely to have problem drinking than students who remain silent on this topic.
Moreno suggests that peers, such as housing counselors, monitor the site and help a student post too many status updates.
“You can’t solve a problem if you haven’t realized it,” said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno’s co-author and head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children’s Research Institute in Seattle.
"We have found a way to identify at-risk children who would not otherwise have been found."
Facebook also constantly taps the data of its own population.
The site’s data team has compiled statistics on relationship status and Valentine’s Day, voter turnout in the 2010 midterm elections, and a National Happiness Index (using primarily data that only Facebook has access to – Masters of Digital Freedom have long known that the site should make its vast data mine accessible to others for research purposes.)
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they want it or not. In order to be able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you allow the site to release your own personal data.
But what if Facebook users become part of a survey they don’t even know about yet?
While researchers have strict guidelines on how to collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
“I don’t think many users have thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles at all,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, to a 2006 study in which he surveyed the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As far as she's concerned, it's just about her and her friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a researcher is absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how much of the information in a user profile and in posts is true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn says.
Therefore, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
“There’s no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people,” he says.
“Social research needs to take care of social – and lots of social life is still taking place offline.”
"Cold and inhumane": Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time in a public court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who stood two amok runs in which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, has described himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" fighter.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a temple knight in Norway," he told a courtroom with more than 500 people.
“I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support hate ideologies and because it supports multiculturalism.”
"I recognize the laws, but I do not confess guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he could express his views."
For the same reason, Breivik, who brought a pre-written speech, refused permission to address his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the Breivik police to remain in detention for another 12 weeks, he has no access to the media for four weeks, and he said that the authorities will closely monitor all visits and all correspondence over eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims took part in the hearing.
Some came in the hope of seeing Breivik in the eye, others wanted confirmation that he remained behind the castle and bars.
All took part with the aim that everything runs out to a conclusion.
"I thought he looks cold and inhumane," a Utoya survivor told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it goes a bit further after I saw and heard the suspect."
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie, acting calmly and professionally throughout the hearing, looking into the eyes of journalists and survivors as he entered and left the building again.
Despite Breivik’s bizarre indication that he was part of a larger “resistance” movement, the judge concluded that he was not mentally ill and said there was no evidence that he had accomplices.
Some may like that the July 22 attacks appeared to have been the work of an individual extremist and not that of a group of radicals.
But does that automatically alleviate the grief and confusion that an entire nation still feels?
“I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn’t,” said one victim’s relative.
“It would be so much easier if he did it.”
7 Lessons from the Interview with the Deceased Steve Jobs Shown This Week in a Theater
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, highlighting the genius of technology as a great modern inventor.
But what Apple fans may find most revealing in the recently rediscovered job interview, which was dusted off this week before special film screenings in the major markets, is how much this creative head has understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and a self-appointed hippie, but he was also an meticulous organizer who eagerly crafted diagrams - a man who believed that many CEOs suffer from "a disease of thinking," "that a really great idea makes up 90 percent of the work... [but] there's an enormous amount of work going on."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Professional Idiots" about the break-up of the personal computer. And he sat together for more than an hour with jobs, in which they conducted one of the rare, detailed conversations.
By that time, it had been 10 years since Jobs had been forced from Apple, and he was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, and was looking forward to the widespread adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of Cringley’s interview was used in specialist idiots, he says that the copy templates of the interview were missing at the time of delivery.
It was only after Jobs’ death that a complete VHS copy was discovered in the director’s garage.
This slightly revised footage forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which arrives at the Landmark Theater this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is known for abhorring detailed interviews, Jobs here appears surprisingly zealous in explaining his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In the course of the interview, there are four times longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, in which Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts and strives for accuracy.
There are also moments when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to light when he seems impatiently responds to Cringely’s questions and urges him to deal more quickly with topics or side actions of greater importance.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone recorded, the Lost Interview appears somehow eeriely far-sighted when Jobs evaluates what other companies do right or wrong in his opinion and represents his own vision for the future of the computer.
It's one thing to read posthumous appreciations of Jobs' career, but seeing Jobs here as the eager dreamer who is on the brink of grandeur is something completely different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of what things could and should be.
Shortly after he had done all this here, he left and did it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the Lost Interview:
How he learned to run a business:
"Throughout the years in business, I always ask, 'Why are you doing things?' And the answer you always get is, 'Oh, that's how it's made easy.'
No one knows why he does what he does. No one in the business really thinks deeply about things.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues his efforts to streamline accounting at Apple.
Surprisingly, how costs were recorded – usually starting with “standard costs” that were quantified to mere guesswork and then adjusted with “deviation” – he developed an automated factory that ensured that business costs could be determined to the smallest extent.
How the Pope was enthralled:
Jobs tells the story of the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which one could sneak into the phone company and have long-distance conversations for free.
A lot has already been written about the device, but Jobs’ enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-empowerment is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a toll phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another, while grinding through as many satellites as possible.
“We sent stuff around the globe a half-dozen times and when you peed into the phone, it came out a minute later on the phone next door,” Jobs said.
“We were young and we learned that we can build something ourselves that can control trillions of dollars of infrastructure around the world.”
We both didn’t know much, but we were able to build this little thing that can control a gigantic thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don’t think there would be Apple without it.
Jobs continues on about a glorious stroke that Wozniak and he almost pulled off when they called via Blue Box in the Vatican in the middle of the night and wanted to talk to the pope while they could as well imitate Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomat, the two had to laugh before the pope himself came to the phone.
How he fell in love with technology (and unpreparedly called Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he searched for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone call, Jobs received a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard for the summer.
"It had a remarkable impact on me, it was the only company I had seen at the age and it shaped my views on what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Later, Jobs became one of HP’s employees visiting the company’s research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw “the first desktop computer ever made.”
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with brown tube and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on this machine and write programs for her.
How to improve innovations:
Several times in the interview, Jobs talks about how to spontaneously invent new products.
Early in his career, when he built some circuit boards, he was asked by a customer to assemble the entire computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to consider both the assembly and the delivery of the finished equipment.
Later at Apple, he remembers the problems he had with developing a computer mouse:
“I remember pervasive arguments... They screamed at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer.”
Ninety days later we had a mouse that we could build for $15. That was incredibly credible.
About big companies that are slowing down:
Long before he revived Apple, Jobs foresaw the ways in which so many industrial giants stumbled with their visions and lost control of their stocks.
"Say, you work at IBM or Xerox, so do you make a better copier or printer, then and?"
They own the stock monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [they are] the people who ultimately lead the companies and the product with which people are pushed out of decision making.
The product genius that led to this monopoly position is eradicated by the people who have no concept of good products vs. bad products - craftsmanship is necessary.
This happened at Xerox.
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
One could have been ten times bigger if it had been the Microsoft of the 1990s...
You have conquered defeat by victory.
Innovation as an art form:
“There’s a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop that great idea, it changes and grows.”
You learn a lot about its subtleties.
You have to vote, certain things you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
Ultimately, it comes down to the taste, it comes down to trying to get rid of the best stuff that humans have created and then trying to bring these things together to what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who work there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who happen to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it weren’t for the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of health laws, as court accepts case
On the day that the Supreme Court meets behind closed doors to discuss the politically divisive issue of whether to hear a challenge to President Obama’s health laws, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a dinner sponsored by the Chancellery that will be presided over by the court.
The incident took place last Thursday when all nine judges met for a meeting to discuss the petitions for consideration.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a lawsuit filed by 26 states against far-reaching health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that became a buzzword among conservative activists across the United States.
In fact, a 5-and-a-half-hour fundamental discussion is expected in March, the outcome of which is likely to fuel the 2012 presidential campaign, which will be in full swing at the time the court decision is announced.
The lawyer who will stand trial and claim that the law is to be tipped will probably be Paul Clement, once Attorney General under George W. Bush.
Clements’ law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that supported the Federalist Society’s annual dinner, an old-fashioned group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which is challenging the law.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which is financially heavily involved in the outcome of the process.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court had consulted on the case, at a Washington hotel.
The service included Mitch McConnell, the Republican Party leader in the Senate and an outspoken opponent of health reform.
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges have been attending events of the Federalist Society for years.
This is not in violation of moral rules.
In fact, judges are exempted from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under Principle 4c of the Code, which states: "A judge may participate in charity events of the law and other organizations, whereby the judge may not be a speaker, guest of honor or, according to the program, a guest of such events."
Nevertheless, the extreme closeness of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms involved in the case, as well as to a company with a massive financial interest in the case, was enough to alarm moral and government activists.
“This astonishing breach of morality and the contravention of the code punishes the lawsuits of some judges for lying, the court sticks to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges won and dined during a benefit event with lawyers with pending proceedings in court."
Their appearance and their support of a donation campaign for this event undermines any claim to impartiality and is not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics who say they would too easily mix court case with groups that can be guided by the agenda, such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, the Conservatives claim that it is judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a public prosecutor under the Obama administration when the first lawsuits came to court in the first instance.
Her critics urged Kagan to withdraw himself from the hearing of the case because of bias, as she was too committed to defending the law to be biased.
Kagan does not make arrangements to do so.
Boeing Pulls Record $18 Billion Order Ashore
Emirates has ordered 50 twin-aisle Boeing 777 aircraft with an option for 20 more.
In addition, Boeing sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 trillion.
It’s really a rare news that a company gets an order over 50 pieces of its products.
But it’s a big deal if the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 planes in total is at a record $18 trillion.
Equally unusual is Boeing’s client: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast released on Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that airlines from the Middle East will need 2,520 planes worth $450 trillion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its largest commercial aircraft order of all time this weekend, measured by the value of the order: 50 double-decker Boeing 777 jets.
The hammer order came from the airline Emirates from Dubai.
The airline also announced at the 2011 Dubai Aviation Show that it has an option to purchase 20 more aircraft, bringing the total list price to $26 trillion.
On Monday, according to Boeing Oman Air, then ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which greatly improves fuel consumption and passenger comfort.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than $1 trillion.
“This is absolutely positive for Boeing,” said Neal Dihora, Morningstar stock exchange specialist.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by oil-producing countries.
So not only do they have the money to pay for the planes, but an increase in oil prices that usually hurts the airlines, as this is one of their biggest cost points, is not so bad as the country deserves a higher oil price.
This is important because they tend to cancel or postpone aircraft orders less than other airlines when oil prices rise, Dihora said.
“They have a natural security,” he said.
The Emirates order reaffirms Boeing’s leadership position in the large-scale aircraft market and helps keep Airbus competitor SAS in check, which is attacking the supremacy with the A350.
Boeing’s victory at the aviation show comes four months after Airbus announced it would postpone the introduction of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was postponed to gain more confidence after customers demanded a higher payload and range.
Boeing shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican president's sister apparently loses election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug dealers supported opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race for governorship.
President Felipe Calderon’s sister apparently lost her bid for governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections, claiming on Monday that drug dealers had influenced the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Party of the Revolution, the PRI, won the race for governorship in the western state.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process, and especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," Calderon said in a radio interview one day after the election on Sunday.
“They threatened our candidates, our staff in the polls ... they occupied election booths, built roadblocks ... and commissioned people to vote [for the PRI].”
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until they lost the presidency in 2000.
But they are striving for a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have narrowly beaten Claderon, who had led the polls before election day.
Calderon, a candidate of her brother's conservative Partido Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n Nacional PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left Democratic Revolutionary Party PRD, who is still in office, came in third place, a serious defeat for the divided and unlucky left leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, the former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies links to drug dealers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels that specialize in marijuana, heroin, and amphetamines.
It is the homeland of President Calderon and he chose Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence is still going on.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during an election event for Luisa Maria Calderon, and numerous candidates have emerged from the local elections out of fear.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how repulsive the elections in Michoacan seem.
The man who will presumably represent the PRI in the race for the presidency is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory makes us look boldly into next year."
ADB urges Asia to help rescue the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the eurozone in its severe debt crisis to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the Manila-based ADB, said the world’s two fastest-growing economies must do “everything in their power” to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned of the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) looking “passionately” at the difficulties in Europe, and said that Asia’s financial support to European leadership and European resources helps prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
“We’re all in the same boat.”
“So anyone who can help Europe out of this crisis is helpful,” he told the Financial Times in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it's not immune."
"If China and India can help, then by all means."
Europe’s monetary union has fallen into a serious debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s interest rates have risen dangerously and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The emerging severe debt crisis in Europe raises fears that the global economy could plunge into recession and led to calls that leading emerging markets must come together to support the eurozone.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but said that mutual agreements – such as the purchase of bonds from the EU bailout fund, the European Financial Stabilisation Facility (EFSF) – offer greater bargaining power to European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, India’s trade minister, said that “India will do everything in its power” to help the eurozone, as its economy is now suffering from declining exports and dehydration of foreign capital flows.
“Nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent,” he said.
“We are facing great challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not an option, it’s an assignment, because where else do we find work for our millions of young men and women?”
Others argue that emerging economies such as India have no incentive to help wealthy Europeans when they themselves face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University, said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to the 1.2 trillion people in India for Europe, of whom more than 800 million live on $2 or less a day.
"Someday they'll find out that the Greeks are going to retire at 50 and spend vacations on the beach, and then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, similarly asked why India’s reserves should be used to keep the numerous and well-paid public servants in Greece, with jobs in poorly managed, loss-making facilities such as the railways.
Mr Nag said that the crises in the eurozone will have "significant domino effects" on all of Asia.
The ADB’s forecast of economic growth of 7.5 percent in Asia for 2011 now threatens “the risk of graduation” due to the imminent danger from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets would have to create “crisis plans” to protect themselves from a downward trend and a significant capital outflow of their words.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon about possible cuts in defense
Defense Minister Leon Panetta hit Congress on Monday, warning that automatic budget cuts would undetectedly weaken national security, triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon’s halls to Afghanistan’s war theaters and civilian ligaments.
The Pentagon is already considering cuts of $450 trillion over the next decade, but is now fearful that further cuts of $600 trillion or more will be needed if Congress is unable to finalize spending.
“The impact of these cuts would be devastating to the ministry,” Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said a failure by Congress to reach a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called seizure, would result in 23% general cuts as well as a halt to numerous new projects.
“Such a high cut, carried out in such a reckless way, would make most of our ship and construction projects unfeasible – you can’t buy three-quarters of a ship or a building – and would seriously damage other modernization efforts,” Panetta wrote to the senators.
“We would also be forced to involuntarily detach from a large part of our civilian personnel and, as the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to leave civilians with a limited probability of safety in order to achieve the goal.”
“These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our alertness.”
The cuts eventually hit the fighting troops,” Panetta said.
"While the wartime contingents in the anti-terrorist fight are not directly affected by the seizure, the serious intervention in the basic budget would adversely affect the war effort," Panetta warned.
“Personal settings were cut, which would lead to delays in the settings and hiring oversight that support the war.”
“The salaries of the personnel would be reduced, leading to late payments to wartime merchants, and the legal as well as political support would be disrupted.”
The two senators responded to Panetta 10 days ago and asked for more details regarding the potential impact of automatic cuts on the Defense Ministry.
"The consequences of a seizure of the Department of Defense would trigger a rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power."
“We are vehemently opposed to this draconian act,” the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon as they published Panetta’s letter.
“This is a result that we cannot live with, and it is certainly not something that should be forced upon us.”
"The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and should not be allowed to enter."
Whether Panetta’s letter and Senators’ new warnings will increase pressure on a compromise in the budget or intensify demands to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has increasingly bluntly expressed the possible cuts, although he was able to gain many years of experience with the budget in Congress and the White House before coming to the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he is facing difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the defense minister painted a gloomy picture of what could be coming – a military with shell but without a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's an air force squadron without adequately trained pilots."
“It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without adequately trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission,” Panetta said in his opening speech at the Pentagon.
“It’s a force that lacks morale and alertness and is unable to engage with potential adversaries.”
“It really makes you angry.”
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta outlined new details of how reductions "create significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious limitations on our global deployment and intervening capabilities, leading to an unacceptable risk of future war."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects of the deletion could fall victim, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning phase.
This list also includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship, and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace the Humvee.
If further development and testing of the F35 were stopped, this would save up to $80 trillion over the next 10 years, but proponents say it is an important next step to upgrade so that possible dangers by China and other opponents can be banned.
How to Detect a Lie
A look at the current headlines shows how worrying and widespread deception and lies are in daily life.
The Republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain, is busy becoming the master of the accusations of sexual harassment on the part of several women. Both sides accuse each other of lying.
Penn State’s leadership is accused of taking the oath of office because they have allegedly withheld reports that a retired football coach sexually abused boys.
Last week, an open mic was heard when French President Nicolas Sarkozy told US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake up countries.
The New York congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner fooled himself when he circulated denials that were quickly refuted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of violating campaign funding, which is related to the cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And then of course, no one who has experienced it forgets the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered when he lied during his second term in the Oval Office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories about bullying at school and at college exams are widespread.
There have been incidents in which teachers have provided their students with the exam responses so that they would be well on their own during their performance checks.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lying and cheating are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
Studies show that we lie 10 to 200 times a day.
Many of these lies, however, are considered emergency lies.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Recognizing lies or “discovering lies” is one that is important for every person to learn, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far removed from a social game such as Scharaden, in which the goal is to call "Have You!", deception is a serious field of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at reputable universities, particularly in the field of psychology, and extensive research projects.
One result of the research is that most of the old myths about lying have been debunked.
Lies look you in the eye.
They do not always stutter, stutter, blush and zappel.
However, we cannot conclude from this that these liars are difficult to detect and expose.
A skilled debunker of lies can penetrate to the truth by learning something about the structure of the claim, the fine facial expressions, about questioning and timing.
I have spent several years studying the scientific results of the comprehensive and ever-growing field of de-escalation. And it is clear that de-escalation is a modern skill that is easy to learn and belongs to us in finding out in our complex world, especially when hiring or interviewing individuals or negotiators.
Good liars are very good at assessing other people, arousing their interest and mastering their own emotions, and they intuitively feel how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to the research, we know that extroverted people lie more often than introverted people, that men more often "self-oriented" lies than women whose lies are more "oriented to others" - as a rule, they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people lie to their partners less often than unmarried people.
We also know that when a person has been exposed as an offender, others feel less guilty about having lied to that person.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, by observing the normal behavior of this person.
This is called "Baselining", the starting position.
It provides a reference point for the subsequent evaluation of changes.
Observe the attitude, the laughter, the voice quality of their subject.
You should know better when someone is normally tripling with the foot all the time, so they don’t wrongly accuse him of tripling with the foot during a meeting.
Then pay attention to accumulations of conspicuous verbal and nonverbal behaviors.
Consider these build-ups as alarm bells that scream, not as evidence of detargeting.
People who cheat may solidify when they try to remember their story. Maybe point their feet towards the door or they lean towards the exit, change their position in a significant way, or show a "relaxation after the hiring conversation", this deep, relaxing breathing out and the change in attitude are all there when
Questioners often falsely signal that a job interview is over, only to keep an eye on this relaxation after the job interview.
Also, pay attention to the language of your subject.
Scott Peterson’s slipper is famous for using the form of the past when he claimed his dead wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Deceiving people can also use a distancing language: “I had no sexual relationship with this woman...Miss Lewinsky” or if you repeat a tricky question altogether.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when answering a tricky question: "Well... to tell you the truth... as far as I know... to the best of my knowledge and conscience."
This makes the response more perceptive than factual, which often causes the alarm bells to scream.
There is no magic to debunking lies, but one can learn skills thanks to which debunking is possible.
Thanks to these skills, anyone can become a victim of fraud less often, both in private and professional life.
Controversial Oil Pipeline Plan Revisited After Risk of Delayed U.S. Approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada into the Gulf of Mexico, which angered the unions and at the same time reassured environmentalists, the pipeline-building company is trying to re-plan the project so that it can return to normal.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that it will divert the planned pipeline from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Nebraska Parliament Building.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said the company remains confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, albeit with a different course.
This came after an announcement by the Foreign Ministry last week that a decision on a federal approval for the project would be postponed until the new possible course was reviewed, which avoided the area of the Sandhills in Nebraska as well as the Ogallala Aquifer, a large underwater supply.
"This is a real step forward," Republican Lee Terry, a Nebraska Republican, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the foreign ministry may delay a decision until 2013, after the elections next year, even though officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama said in a written statement last week that the decision was a matter for the State Department and expressed his support.
The 1700-mile pipeline was connecting Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil a day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
To do this, the pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labor markets love them, because they estimate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
But Nebraska’s lawmakers, who are against the plan, are weighing the laws to force a diversion from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala Aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the environment impact of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has found that the project would have little impact on the environment, but the energy industry source says that the ministry’s chief inspector has requested a separate probe of the review procedure, which focuses on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company commissioned to carry out the original study was an inappropriate choice as it is associated with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle accused of forcing a toddler to vomit out of fear
A New York family claims that the disco diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of her Manhattan building has had a toad-hunting attack that has so frightened her little daughter that she has surrendered out of fear.
The “Lady Marmalade” singer’s tirade made 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so afraid that she was suffering from “personality changes, sleep disorder” and “increased fear of strangers,” her family told the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on November 10 last year that stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergartener, and Genevieve wanted to leave for a family outing.
While Kevin Monk picked up the car, Roseanna Monk went into the lobby in her building on Riverside Boulevard with her luggage and Genevieve on her arm.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and dropped her daughter off for a moment.
"Someone appeared behind me and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing right now?' I said, 'Yes,' and went to take her back on her arm," she said.
LaBelle infuriated the pregnant woman.
“She said in an aggressive tone, ‘You shouldn’t put your daughter down near the door,’” Roseanna Monk said.
"I told her, 'I don't care what you say or think.'"
She got angry and started to scold - she used the F-word and the A-word and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and started tipping water from the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve had become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter,'" the child's mother said.
LaBelle crashed into the mother, who was still carrying Genevieve on her arm, and had to be held back by her escort and pulled into a waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
The baby screamed so much that it had to surrender, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family asked for an apology in writing, but received no response.
LaBelle’s lawyer and representative did not respond to calls requesting a statement.
The lawsuit is about an unspecified damages, but the family’s attorney, Sam Davis, said he doesn’t charge any fees and the family plans to donate the money they receive to child cancer care.
“We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior,” Davis said.
"This type of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is compared to a kindergartener who is carrying an 18-month-old baby on her arm."
Climate Disadvantages Are Slowing the Economy
In the first year that Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez is in government, unemployment and black labour rose in Sinaloa, while foreign investment declined and the economy stagnated.
2011 will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloas. It is the first year in which Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez, who describes himself as the initiator of change and aggravates great hopes regarding economic growth, is in government. However, due to the climatic constraints, the most important indicator of growth can not be the most important in the economy.
The low temperatures in February not only caused losses in millions in agriculture, but also pushed the growth of the national economy close and caused a general decline in economic activity by 3.6 percent in the first quarter. This is mainly due to the historical decline in agricultural development by 31.16 percent.
According to a report published by the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development), 582 000 hectares of farmland were damaged, of which 78.03 per cent were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 per cent of the crops were partially destroyed.
The decline in economic activity until November has caused unemployment in the Mexican state to rise continuously to 18% in the first six months of the year. In the first quarter, the Instituto Nacional de Estad<0xC3><0xAD>stica y Ge<0xC3><0xB3>graf<0xC3><0xAD>a observed a rapid increase in unemployment, because from January to March, 55 053 inhabitants of Sinaloas had no employment, which is more than 4.53 percent of the employment rate in September.
Reduced liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa this year is due to several factors: Gerardo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes, Dean of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences at the University of Aut<0xC3><0xB3>noma (UAS), commented on the policy of public institutions indirectly explaining the growing unemployment.
"What we are currently seeing is an increase in unemployment, which has to do with several factors. Among other things, with liquidity losses in the market as a result of the cuts in funds by the legislation passed to combat money laundering in Congress," because something that he is not willing to use for those who forbid, it is too easy to accumulate dollars.
Migration Stopped
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes pointed out that rising unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people leaving the country looking for work abroad, especially in the United States, has decreased. This is due on the one hand to the problems of entry and on the other hand, because it is also difficult to find work there. These people stay here and look for work here, which increases unemployment," he says.
Black work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious, taking into account the high proportion of black work. According to INEGI, this includes 60.38 percent of the employees in the country who work without paying into the social security funds.
Unemployment and black work are the lowest wages in all of Mexico, according to statistics from the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Insurance Institution) and the Secretar<0xC3><0xAD>a del Trabajo y Previsi<0xC3><0xB3>n Social (Governmental Authority for Labour and Social Welfare in Mexico).
The average monthly earnings of workers in Sinaloa amounted to 5352 pesos as of September; this is much less than the national average of 7375 pesos.
Decrease in ADI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and rising unemployment, in 2011 the strongest decline in foreign direct investment (ADI) in the last ten years was recorded. According to the Secretariat of Economic Affairs (State Economic Authority), the ADI amounted to $ 630,597 from January to June, which represents a drop of $ 87.74 per cent compared to the time of the year.
The Secretar<0xC3><0xAD>a de Desarrollo Econ<0xC3><0xB3>mico del Gobierno (Governmental Authority for Economic Development) has a total investment of 17 280 000 pesos in 2011, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
The debts
In view of the economic crisis, in July, the State Government applied to the National Congress for a loan of 3 000 000 000 pesos to be invested in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities to reactivate the economy.The State Congress approved an amount of 200 600 000 pesos, but no positive effects of the debt on the economy could be ascertained until November.
Reactions
For the representatives of entrepreneurship, the first year of government made Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdés incapacity for government evident.
Miguel Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, Chairman of the C<0xC3><0xA1>mara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformaci<0xC3><0xB3>n (National Chamber of Manufacturing in Mexico), said that no efforts were made in 2011 to harmonize the views of different sectors, including the state government.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really very poor this year. It has to be worked hard to regain the land lost this year and in 2012 we have to double our efforts. The efforts of all and especially the progress of the already well-tuned government team have not been sufficiently coordinated with each other," he explained.
Slow economic development
Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez said that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year hampered and slowed the country's economic development.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the freeze. One of the most important impacts is a slowing economy that is not moving enough to create an economic dynamic that could generate an acceptable flow of processes, products and services," he said.
Re-define vocation
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, Chairman of the Confederaci<0xC3><0xB3>n Patronal de la Rep<0xC3><0xBA>blica Mexicana (Mexico Business Association) in Sinaloa, stated that the state must be encouraged to develop more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that work has been done. We believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program to redefine the economic vocation and line of the country, because it is important to activate all material and human resources of Sinaloas," he said.
There's a lot to do
The chairman of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that steers the efforts of the government in better ways.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term program," he explained.
He stressed that the current state power has made progress with the government.
"There are areas where you can say that the government has acted more comprehensively. What I can say is that work has been done and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead of it," he said.
Arrested for 8 kg of marijuana
A Navolato resident was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in prison for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The prosecutor's office announced that the drug dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a crime against public health - here the possession of marijuana intended for trading.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I file, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on June 7, 2010, by Mexican military in the surveillance of the Cipriano Valdez road in front of guard post No. 80 in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer drove in a white van, holding a black bag in a box in the car and a small backpack on the passenger seat, in which the military found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated goods were handed over to the judge of the district and the punishment is still in the execution facility.
Debts for construction work
Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Miranda said that the social buildings for migrants provided for in the Habitat, Rescate de Espacios P<0xC3><0xBA>blicos and 3x1 programmes are in danger of not being completed due to lack of funds or only with great delay.
The head of the city’s social development authority said that although the construction programs are already advanced, they are now in danger, as the state government has not paid the funds it has received, which exceeds 11 million pesos for the three programs.
He said that the total investment in these three programs is almost 50 million pesos, of which 25 percent fell to the state. Until now, only the Federaci<0xC3><0xB3>n and the municipality had contributed funds to the construction work, which is why a delay in the completion of the construction should be expected.
"They have to contribute 12 million, and although the year is coming to an end, they have not given us a penny, and that, although they should have paid us a part already in July," he said. "In order not to be late, we have already started the construction work, and they are already well advanced, but we need the money."
He pointed out that under the government of Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Aguilar Padilla, the state had not fulfilled its obligations, which is why the municipality had to take out a loan of 7 million at the beginning of his reign, which corresponds to the amount that the central government would have had to raise.
"We had already done this in the last legislature because the state did not have sufficient economic resources. The programs continued and this year we had to obtain the funds that the state had not raised to participate in these programs," he said.
Although the state authorities were obliged to disburse these funds, he commented that the Minister for Administration and Finance, , was asked to speed up the administrative work and to disburse the outstanding share as soon as possible.
"Almost 12 million they have to contribute, and although the year is coming to an end, they have not given us a penny."
Court approves transition to digital television in Mexico for 2015
The conversion of analogues to digital signals has been one of the most important changes in the world in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) rejected the constitutional lawsuits filed by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential decree, and by which the transition from analogue to digital signals from 2021 to 2015 must be pre-determined, due to the lack of eight votes required to challenge the law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, were of the opinion that President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n did not exceed his responsibilities when he issued the legislative decree with the details of switching to terrestrial digital television.
This decision rejected the constitutional dispute created by the Senate, as it did not receive the necessary qualified majority of eight votes, so that the court could decide on constitutionality or non-constitutionality.
In the draft complaint prepared by Minister Olga S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero, it was proposed that the decree be declared unconstitutional, since the regulations relating to radio and television are the responsibility of the Comisi<0xC3><0xB3>n Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico).
Only Zald<0xC3><0xAD>var, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed constitutional complaints against the Legislative Decree. After the adoption of the complaints, Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero no longer applied the Legislative Decree and ceased all activities to set up the digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the complaint filed by the Chamber of Deputies without taking part in the debate on the project, for which Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero was also responsible.
In his contribution, the Prime Minister stated that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the national government should not regulate the measures to be taken by the public administration with general rules.
"I also do not believe that doing so would undermine the independence of the regulatory body." She also recalled that the central government is responsible for the planning of strategic policies, such as the telecommunications sector, for constitutional reasons, because it manages state affairs.
Replacing analog signals with digital is one of the most important changes that has taken place in recent years around the world, and it results in better use of the radio spectrum, increased signal quality and more channels.
The postponement of the transition, she said, is a postponement of the benefits of digitization, which is a decision in the public interest, which has not only technical aspects, "because it encompasses economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, she stressed, "made the action of the whole system necessary, according to the principle of economic management by the state, they contained a group of features that placed the constitution in the hands of the central government."
She recalled that many countries around the world had already implemented the digital transformation, through the government, even though they had highly specialized facilities.
It cannot be concluded that the government would interfere with the powers of Congress with the issue of the contested legislative decree, because the laws passed by the legislature would be respected," she assured.
The possibility of counting the ballots in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n individually is considered
According to PREP, the difference between the first and second place in the election of the governor is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 have not yet been counted.
The possibility of individual ballot counting this year in the elections in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n is a reality, because according to the data issued by the Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminaires (PREP), the difference between the first and second place in the governor's elections is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 have not yet been counted.
In this sense, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n (IEM), Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that it was only on 9 November that the electoral office adopted a series of regulations to harmonize local regulations with the reforms of the states in electoral matters.
It should be remembered that Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n had not adapted his political constitution, nor his electoral law, nor his law on electoral justice to the reforms passed by Congress, so that they had not entered into force in this round of elections. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided their publication in the public prosecutor's office, nor did he have any plans to do so.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) ruled on the constitutional complaint filed by the local legislature and judged the vote of the Ombudsman on the constitutional reforms as "invalid and illegal" as he does not have the right to "decide on it or veto it."
Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal stated in an interview on the possibility of individual counting of votes that, thanks to the adoption of the guidelines by the Consejo General del IEM, there would now be the possibility that the local electoral authority could count the ballots partially or completely.
Thus, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more electoral packages may be counted in part. The results in the minutes are incompatible; the minutes on the counting and calculation of votes are not in the file or are not in the possession of the chairman of the electoral committee, or there are obvious errors or amendments in the minutes.
In addition, the total counting of the fully filled ballots can be done if there is a difference between the alleged winner and the one who is in second place, which is equal to or less than one percent, provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is an explicit request of the party or coalition candidate, the second is the candidate.
The vote count may also be carried out in its entirety if, after the completion of the ordinary calculation, it is established that the difference between the alleged winner and the candidate in second place is equal to or less than one percent, provided that there is an express request from a representative of the party whose candidate would have been selected from a second party, the election of which would have been preceded by a second party.
It is worth noting that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation, where according to PREP the difference between the first and second place is almost 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 out of a total of 923 electoral protocols have not yet been counted.
His Last Will <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
His ashes will be scattered across the Zapalinamé Mountains, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés sold out this Sunday night on Saltillo, his birthplace, and on Monday the show of the dead and a mass of the dead took place.
According to family members, the Colonel’s last will was that his ashes be scattered over the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After an honor, the family of Bacio Cortés, along with the others who died in the accident, returned to the capital of Coahuila in an aircraft of the Mexican Air Force.
At twelve noon the ashes of the lieutenant-colonel landed in the Trauerhalle, which is on Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, and where the family and friends arrived.
At 5:30 p.m., his remains were examined at the Saltillo Institute of Technology, where his former classmates from the technical high school and his American football team, Felipe Bacio, attended the funeral while he was preparing for the high school.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ashes would be scattered over the Zapalinamé Mountains, which he had always said to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
From her point of view, the lieutenant-colonel had fulfilled all his dreams and she believes that he had stood in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, exceptionally as a father and as a son, a loving brother and he always stood for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young to enter the school of the Air Force of Zapop<0xC3><0xA1>n, Jalisco.
Some could not grasp it because they thought it would even dizzy him on a truck, yet he always strived to realize his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto D<0xC3><0xA1>vila Bacio remembers him as a good person. "He had hardly arrived in Saltillo, and the whole family already wanted to welcome him, as on the occasion when he brought Martha Sahag<0xC3><0xBA>n to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even at the age of seven he went to Zapop<0xC3><0xA1>n to graduate his family member, so he knows that his uncle died when he did what he liked best: flying a plane.
One Last Farewell
The Lieutenant-Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was honoured by the Governor Jorge Torres L<0xC3><0xB3>pez. His honors were bestowed on him by the people and the government, the Mexican Army of the sixth military district, the Mexican Air Force, he studied as a sports instructor and a student of Salfiel's school in 1985.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago when the helicopter he flew, in which the Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six other people from the same authority were also seated, crashed.
At 6.05 p.m., the remains of Bacio Cortés, a citizen of Saltillo, arrived at the outskirts of the barracks to be handed over to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, who had already been waiting for him by his family members, including his daughter, Amanda, and his sister-in-law, Christine.
The abandoned bodies were found on a plot of land on Cadeyta NL
A few hours before the discovery, members of the military presented to the media eleven people who had been arrested in the same town in connection with the organized crime.
Three men were found shot in different body parts and a mercy shot killed in an abandoned finca in Cadeyta Jiménez, Nuevo Le<0xC3><0xB3>n.
The event took place at the 1.5 kilometer point of the Cadeyta to Santiago road at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several transients saw that the door of the country house surrounded by a beige-brown wall stood wide.
When they looked into the house, they found about three meters further inside the bodies of three people, which they immediately informed the competent authorities.
One was wearing a yellow T-shirt and dark pants, without shoes; next to him was another, dressed in a white top.
Just one meter away was the body of another person with a red T-shirt and blue pants.
All three were on their stomachs.
According to information obtained on the spot, the three people must have been murdered in another location, as no cartridge cases were found.
On the wall of the country house you can read inscriptions that one organized criminal gang writes to another, in addition, several shots were found in the wall and door.
11 people arrested in Cadeyta
The Secretar<0xC3><0xAD>a de la Defensa Nacional (Secretariat of State for National Defense) introduced 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal gang that was mainly active in the town of Cadeyta, and who were associated with kidnappings, murder, halconeo (human hunting) and secret burials.
According to the information made public, eight people were first arrested on November 11 in the settlement of Los Alveros and one prisoner was released.
Three properties and a cell phone were secured, and the detainees confirmed they were members of the Los Zetas criminal group.
On November 12, at 6 a.m., the military found a car without license plates with two occupants on their watch in the village of Rancho Viejo in Cadeyta.
During the inspection of the car, the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later, on November 13, at 2 p.m., one of her accomplices in the community of La Frauda was arrested, who at the sight of the military tried to escape.
They are charged with covert funerals in General Ter<0xC3><0xA1>n, China and Cadeyta.
On Wednesday the formation of the new Italian government
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce the new government that is set to face the crisis that has brought Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce the new government that is set to face the crisis that has brought Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that the Monti appointed on Sunday would meet with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, on Wednesday to confirm the formation of the government.
It is expected that he will present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new prime minister will take office.
Monti said he would present to the president the results of the talks with the political parties on the formation of government.
"I would like to reaffirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to cope with these difficult times," the former EU Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly confirm the formation of the government, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "frame is now well set off," he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than usual, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has pushed the cost of debt to an unbearable level.
The new government, led by former EU Commissioner Monti, has to pass a tough austerity package that has been demanded by Europoliticians in order to regain the confidence it has gained in Italy.
The pressure to rush Monti has been further intensified by the fluctuating market situation, as a result of which Italian government bonds were charged with 7% interest for 10 years, which corresponds to the situation in which Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European bailout umbrella.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian industrial association Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government as much as possible."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to emerge from this emergency.
Montis’ chances of success were greatly increased by the support of the PDL party by Silvio Berlusconi, who had to step down on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
“We believe that Professor Monti’s efforts are destined to produce good results,” said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party.
The support of the PDL, Italy’s largest party, is essential because so far many of its members have spoken out against a majority technocratic government that is currently forming Monti.
Support from Parliament
Monti’s new government needs strong parliamentary support to implement the probably unpopular austerity measures.
Resisting his efforts or delaying reforms could once again lead to a devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks, with its indication that a failure of Montis is a disaster, also exerts pressure.
On Monday, Monti began his debates with political parties, trade unions and business associations, as well as with youth and women's organizations.
The meeting round is expected to be closed on Tuesday evening.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who in response to the crisis has set in motion an extremely rapid change of government.
After a short sigh towards the end of last week, when it was announced that Berlusconi would resign, the uncertainty over the success of the new prime minister has brought the cost of Italian government bonds back to critical limits.
A bailout of Italy with a national debt of 1.8 trillion euros would be too much for the current EU bailout umbrella.
Monti said his government would have to wait until the next election, which is expected to be held in 2013, despite predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms, rather than prefer the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that this should consist only of technicians, a reference to their concerns in the face of the procedure imposed by the pressure of the financial markets.
Political sources point out that the mutual distrust and disagreements between the parties make the inclusion of persons from political life complicated.
Spaniards have more chances to play than the Ticos
Of the 22 players retrieved from Spain, ten have over 50 international games on the bucket.
From Costa Rica's side, only one of the 22 called 50 games has left.
A huge difference for Costa Rica when the 22 for the friendly game, which takes place today at 15:05 at the National Stadium of San José, are compared with the players from both countries.
While the World and European champions, the number one on FIFA’s monthly ranking, can look back on a considerable number of Class A picks, the three-colored team only has defending player Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international games.
This number he reached last Friday with the match against Panama (0-2) in Rommel Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez.
The Spanish players who play in the Liga de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England have the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (Liga and Cup championships) as well as high-ranking European cups such as the Champions League every year.
In addition, the experience with the Spanish fury in complicated elimination games at the Eurocup and the football world championships.
The Tico players, on the other hand, have few international encounters within the framework of Concacaf, which is at the bottom of the FIFA rankings.
We will see how the Spanish team draw their last record: goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who last Saturday reached a tie against England (defeat 0-1 in London) with 126 home games with former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta.
Casillas will play against the three-colored team today and Spain a new record of 127 overseas games.
Xavi Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, player of the Barcelona football club, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received recognition from UEFA last week, along with others from the Iberian team who had reached the magic number 100: the quoted Zubizarreta with 126 and the midfielder of Schalke, Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, with 102.
The number Hundred is also approaching Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He was followed by Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc F<0xC3><0xA1>bregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the side of the Ticos and close to Michael Umana are the left side forward J<0xC3><0xBA>nior D<0xC3><0xAD>az with 48 games and the forward Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From then on, only five of over 30 games came: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez with 36 and José Luis L<0xC3><0xB3>pez with 35.
The ones with the least games.
Fewer than 30 games have been played in the Spanish team: Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Albiol (31).
From the national team come on less than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not even close to the 20s limit.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba has two, in Costa Rica V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Bol<0xC3><0xAD>var records only one and <0xC3><0x93>lman Vargas and Edder Nelson have not made their debut yet.
The historic goalkeeper of Spain is David Villa with 50 hits, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz scored the most goals with nine, two more than Carlos Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet entered Costa Rica on its tour to celebrate its 20th anniversary.
"Playing in Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says the band is ready to give one of their best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
More than 20 years they were expected, but the band assured that a dream would come true for them when they played in Costa Rica.
This was assured by the bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva an exclusive interview last week from Brazil.
The band is in the South American part of their tour to celebrate their 20th anniversary and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On this day they will perform at the National Stadium from 19:30 with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You will read an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript of which can be found in the online edition of La Naci<0xC3><0xB3>n.
A dream comes true for your Costa Rican fans when Pearl Jam is playing in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what it means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream come true for us.
This is just the second time we’ve played in South and Central America, and so far it’s been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once for a holiday. It's such a beautiful country that we will definitely stay there for a few more days.
It’s exciting for us to bring our music there.
I ask you this because the fans of the band are completely dedicated. They experience the days before the concert most intensely.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for being by our side all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and sorry to have taken so long to get here.
Some people even think that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Doesn’t that put a bit of pressure on you from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we’ve done in the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We played on a few giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope they have made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really want to play there.
We love this country, we like to surf and we are enthusiastic about the jungle. For this, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always gone surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico, this is an excellent area for surfing. In this way, we learned about people who love surfing.
With a view of the tour, you have offered huge shows with many songs.
What are your plans for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played there, we also set no limits.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
What's that?
I think that’s partly because we have nine records and we can play over 120 songs. Everyone likes a different song, so the decision we’re going to play each one is not easy.
If we include two or three songs that we have not played in the repertoire for a long time, we can better maintain our concentration and they surprise us, because they remind us of the reasons why we liked these songs, otherwise they could fall into oblivion.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I believe, therefore also for the audience.
With this tour you celebrate your 20 years of history.
When you look back, do you find it hard to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
First of all, I don’t think any of us have ever imagined playing in a great rock band, and that’s been going on for over 20 years, which seems like a dream.
We continue to rely on this blessing and find it great to be able to make music together even now.
We love it and we love making music.
We are lucky to be able to drive to the places in the world that we have always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't be better.
What did it mean for you to have actively participated in the birth of the grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of great bands.
We are good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and quite unusual when a movement emerges from a group of friends.
From time to time, a band comes out of a city, but it is already unusual for five or ten groups to come from the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on their tour. We are still happy to be friends with them all and we are honored to be part of this emerging Seattle sound.
It’s also very unusual for a band like yours to stay together with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) met us 13 years ago. That alone is a lot more time than many bands last.
First of all, I think we all value being happy to be alive and also taking care of each other.
We are all close friends, which is why musical paths have opened up that give each individual the freedom to experiment.
One knows the other and his music, and we couldn't have been better.
Your relationship with fame has not always been easy, but on the other hand, thanks to your success, you were always able to do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we’ve grown has made it easier for us to find balance.
We make sure not to be on tour too often, because it’s too easy to fall for this game with huge crowds of people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people came because of the music, it reminds you that you have to pay attention to the music and what it has brought to life, without being obsessed with being a famous rock star.
What memories do you have of your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and at the beginning it was great.
We were a band for three years that had never released a record until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
We were disappointed to have taken so long. We are still good friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who built the band with us. When I hear a song or see photos, I think about what an incredible person Andy music was together and how he made me laugh and talk about The La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA
He was an extraordinary person and we missed him.
The domestic band Las Robertas are responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her works, especially Eddie Vedder, and that’s why you chose the band for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and we liked this band the best. So we are curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live. That will certainly be exciting.
Why do you always change the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter when you play live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing that comes to mind.
Who has influenced you as a bass player?
From so many+
The first ones I think of include Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge alive, even though it is no longer a fashion phenomenon?
I don't think we all feel very connected to the word grunge.
When I think about it, I think of the bands I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came up at the same time. If they are still important today, I think it’s great because it’s worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney are now making better music than ever before.
At first, her music was darker, now it’s more positive.
What's that?
That's interesting because I think there are a few songs on the new album that might seem a little light-hearted, but there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe that are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive in them.
To both of them, I cried when I heard Ed play them. They are very dark songs.
I think when you get older and something traumatic has happened in your life – for example, when you lose a family member or a friend – it influences your artistic creation and your music and these two songs clearly embody that for me.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to the hospital for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to examine the muscle loss of his legs, his GP said.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who served 25 years in prison for human rights violations during his tenure (1990-2000), has several illnesses, including tongue cancer, which he has operated on four times and is under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, a congressman and his personal doctor, told television that Fujimori would be examined for three days at the Peruvian hospital Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplasicas to determine the cause of his pain and muscle loss in the lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori could be pardoned for humanitarian reasons, but he did not want this because he considered him innocent.
He was operated on four times on tongue cancer and lost 18 kilos of weight, including other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and blood circulation problems in the legs, the doctor said.
Fujimori has been in the National Directorate of Special Operations of the police since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the death squad of the Peruvian army, which was secretly active during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official delegation, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs, will start their visit from Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss regional political issues.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, which, according to the Uruguayan president, will be the highlight of his booked schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective of Uruguayans living in Mexico.
The meeting of the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara "suitable for exchanging information on all policy areas between the two countries," the South American country's presidential office announced on its website.
According to local media, Mujica sought Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n’s support in the incident with France when French Prime Minister Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries that still act as tax havens from the international community, which was rejected by Uruguay and prompted a request to his ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has chaired the G20 since November, a group of the world's most powerful emerging and industrialized countries. Since January of this year, an agreement has been in place on the exchange of tax information to avoid double taxation with the South American country.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has tried to speed up the concretization of agreements on the exchange of tax information in order to be removed from the "grey list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which includes countries that have not adopted all international standards for cooperation in tax matters.
At the business level, a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay has been in place since 2004, which has contributed to a growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The stringy installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been fighting tirelessly for the rescue of Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser for 25 years, but so far never in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land", he fights for the love of the girl in stereo technology.
The game, which comes to the counters around the world this month, has been tailored from the beginning to the characteristics of the Ninth 3DS portable console, with which it can be played three-dimensionally without a special glasses.
"Mario is the figure who has to say how stereoscopy works without glasses," said Omar <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, the head of the Nintendo-specialized press in Spain at the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" was "the first Nintendo video game to be developed from the start for this console" because hit articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" had been adaptations of existing titles.
The Nintendo spokesperson stressed that, although it is three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "affordable" video game that allows for a fast, fluid game.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: The first part is "easy" to capture the less skillful users.
After that, the experts can rotate a "second round" over the different levels of play, which are becoming increasingly difficult.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, in order to overcome the obstacles without becoming a victim of the "optical effects", it is always necessary to play three-dimensionally.
This trip to the three-dimensional world of Super Mario also means the return of the character to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo winks at the fans of the saga and repeats the success recipe of the latest editions: the stringy installer has to overcome platforms spiked with dangers to free Princess Peach.
However, the player encounters news about the movements, the environment, the disguises and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom guarantees Portillo's extradition to the United States
Guatemalan President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he would extradite former governor Alfonso Portillo to be held accountable in the United States for the $70 million money laundering conspiracy.
The trial of the U.S. application for the extradition of Portillo ends, so that he can be brought to justice there.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed his decision based on the independence of the judiciary and the government taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered the extradition.
He stressed that during his administration he had not interfered in court decisions and had accepted all extradition requests that he was notified of.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroqu<0xC3><0xAD>n is extradited for murder and serious bodily injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
The Coloms procedure is an act of government that takes place when all judicial and constitutional bodies are exhausted to condemn the former president (2000 -2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be extradited if his legal situation in Guatemala is clarified and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted of undermining 120 million Quetzals in the Ministry of Defense during his reign. This trial preceded the extradition, but the minister filed an objection and revived the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people threatened by social exclusion
The organisation was set up to avoid the marginalization of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of life of the social assistance organization Trinijove have led to important results: in this quarter century, 6,000 young people threatened by social exclusion were supported to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, there are more than a hundred jobs created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary, an event in the former factory buildings of Fabra i Coats, in which more than 300 people participated, was held yesterday.
Trinijove was founded in 1986 in the Trinitat Vella district with the aim of helping young people with low levels of education, without work, with drug problems threatened by the risk of marginalization.
Yesterday’s celebration in Sant Andreu was attended by numerous managers of institutions and institutions who have worked with the association in these 25 years.
The participation of political representatives of different directions in election campaigns proved the impartiality of the work carried out by Trinijove.
In addition to the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol attended the celebrations of the former Socialist Minister of Education Ernest Maragall and the former Mayor and currently left-green city councilor Ricard Goma.
The great hall of Fabra i Coats was also visited by the current Catalan Minister of Social Affairs and Family, Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Cleries, and the Director General of the Social Work of the Savings Bank La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas emphasized that Trinijove was born in very difficult times and that today's times are no less complicated, but he added that the work done so far is "a good foundation".
For the president of the Generalitat, Trinijove is an example that knows how to fight difficult circumstances and gives people in difficulty hope.
"The economic crisis is nothing new to the club and the work it does," he said.
Occupied house, where huge parties were held, was cleared
The owners had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on Balmes Street No. 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve occupants of the house left the building yesterday afternoon without having made any resistance.
Everything indicates that the nightmares of the neighbors of the house No. 51 on Balmes street have come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building that they had illegally occupied and where they had organized huge festivities that had driven the neighborhood to despair, and the evacuation was carried out on judicial order without police intervention.
After the evacuation, the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, access will be controlled," the house manager confirmed.
The occupiers, who had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited - took the entire electrical system and part of the water supply. In addition, they had painted the walls and left all kinds of garbage, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
In the three lower floors huge parties were celebrated, which lasted up to two days and drove the tenants to despair.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also carried damage from it.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that her business had fallen by 80% since the beginning of the occupation of the house.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the occupiers made her unfair competition, because they sold the drinks for three euros, while they cost 10 euros in the discotheque.
In addition, the owner of the recreation room had been reported by the neighbors for rest disturbance, while according to her, the noise did not come from the visitors of the disco, but from the occupiers of the house and especially from the guests of the parties organized there, and which, according to the statements of the angry neighbors in recent weeks, have become longer and longer.
The head of the discotheque stated that the harassment was so great that she agreed with the owner of the building not to have to pay rent for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (city police) also confirmed that it has received more complaints from neighbors in recent weeks.
The chairman of the PP (Partido Popular - People's Party) in the city council of Barcelona, Alberto Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez D<0xC3><0xAD>az, had last week demanded to immediately clear the building and get control of the problems of civil coexistence and the downfall of the district.
He explained that before the summer only one floor of the building had been occupied, but that in recent months the occupants had entered all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments. In some there had even been thefts.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to intervene against the asocial actions in the building."
Yesterday, another building in the Nou Barris district was cleared by the Catalan police.
At 3:30 p.m., police approached Montral Street No. 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who had watched four people enter the building.
The four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
Apart from the disputes over the fees, the architects agree to the tender.
The urban tender for the 16 gates opens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now-disappeared Corporaci<0xC3><0xB3>n Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its derogatory paper on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
It was even compared in numbers to New York’s Central Park.
With the demise of the CMB in 1987, the park became again the upper limit of Barcelona in the eyes of many, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that does not spread in a north-south direction, but upwards (mountains) and downwards (seas).
The classification of Collserola as a natural park plays with this idea.
As an example, now not Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild boars in the role of the yogi bear.
So far, when the city in September issued a giant tender, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access doors to Collserola.
Undoubtedly, a gate points to the concept of a park.
Either this is the case, or someone is planning to set goals on the land.
The question arises of itself: Collserola, park or mountain?
The call for proposals is not only from an organizational point of view, but also in terms of a reflection on the city the topic of discussion in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring theme that two members of this old-fashioned caste who meet in the elevator can resort to.
And it is precisely this fact that provides the fabric for one of the rare matches between what three architects from Barcelona think about it, and some university professors who have applied for the project.
Miguel Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n, "it is necessary" to talk about the "front on the mountains" after the attack on the coast, as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, which is over the green apples, has not been held.
"One should assume that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because it is easily accessible.
Collserola is more complex," says the architect, for whom the title "Gates of Collserola" contains a "lexical trap": one may not imagine it "as access to a park, but as a limitation of areas on which to act."
Modol, like Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n and Bayona with urban planning experience, sees the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" that carries "some dangers".
Dangers due to the "uncertainty that comes with the design of a public space today" according to the experiences of the 1980s, which had their "swan song" in the forum area.
The first fear is one’s own limitation on what may be built.
“To limit something always means to set the next step,” i.e., to exceed it.
"You have to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current [referring to the General Metropolitano Plan (PGM) ] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, who sticks closer to the question, thinks simplified, the side of Collserola that goes towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that does not go towards Barcelona", and for purely topographical reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the Patronat de Collserola, which should not "stumble on deaf ears", although he is grateful to the city administration for giving his body the opportunity to participate in this project "from the first moment".
In addition, he notes that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the guideline that allows the architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his "doubts" about whether this technical profile should guide the multidisciplinary teams created ("just the right thing," he says).
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of this article is complex, as the tender terms lack a global view of Collserola: "There were 16 cross-sectional competitions," he says, "on the mountain-sea axis. But there is no longitudinal perspective that views the area as a whole."
At least in his case, this has led to him taking part in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate next to it.
In his opinion, the city should absolutely guarantee that the strip is equipped directly above the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length, which creates a soft transition between the city and green zones.
Casino pardons Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal who comes free
After 72 days of silence, Casino Red’s representative freed the brother of the mayor of Monterrey from the trial being conducted against him for alleged blackmail.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal is released after being pardoned by the Casino Red’s representative before the District’s Second Criminal Court, which is conducting the trial against the mayor’s brother for blackmail.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, Sergio Gil Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, the owner of the Casino Red, released a series of photos and videos showing Manuel Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s, who allegedly forced him to pay a sum of money for the city administration to approve the secret operation of the betting house.
After the criminal complaint, the prosecutor’s office opened a criminal case against the brother of the panist mayor, who was arrested on September 2 for 30 days.
After four hours with the official of the Ministerio P<0xC3><0xBA>blico 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was taken to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
He stayed there for 49 days after a second arrest warrant was issued after an official of the Ministerio P<0xC3><0xBA>blico denounced the crimes for bribery and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Cadeyta detention centre for allegedly bribing the owners of the Casino Red with one and a half million pesos, while he remained in the middle security zone for only a few hours as he was facing murder threats.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the trial as a prisoner of the San Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s de los Garza urban prison.
On 25 October, the clerk of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Y<0xC3><0xA1>nez, issued him an arrest warrant, stating that after nearly two months of investigations, he was able to present sufficient evidence to Jonas to plead guilty to the payment of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of this House of Representatives.
On Monday, the representative of Casino Red, V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Aldo Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez, asked Judge José Luis Pecina, the mayor's brother, to issue the sentence, which is why he will be released in the next hours.
During the court hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministerio P<0xC3><0xBA>blico assigned to the court, Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez, asked whether he had remedied the damage and which owner of the betting house had pronounced his pardon, but the lawyer withheld the name.
According to case 197/2011, Jonas Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal is free to speak. Also in the following, no objections can be raised against the trial, and no compensation is claimed.
After the hearing of the Commissioner of the House of Representatives at 3.50 p.m., Larrazabal Bret<0xC3><0xB3>n was immediately released.
The secretary of the court, Jorge Y<0xC3><0xA1>nez, drove to the municipal prison of San Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s de los Garza to inform Jonas that he had been acquitted and his case would be put to the record.
He also informed him of the court order for immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come announced details of the plane crash that killed Secretary of State Francisco Blake and seven others.
The Secretariat of Communications and Transport - SCT (Secretariat of Communication and Transport in Mexico) informed that the results of investigations into the accident in which the government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people died, indicate that the helicopter with its entire intact structure could have impacted directly against the ground.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before the launch that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller wing was in contact with trees at 25 meters altitude, with the helicopter losing its hull, seems to indicate that the helicopter had had several ground contacts."
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 passengers, which is why it met all the requirements for the transport of the personnel.
He also said that no helicopter parts were found during the investigations in the area where the machine had landed.
"No aircraft parts were found elsewhere during the search, the surcharge concerned the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 passengers, which is why it met all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has an inclination of 7 to 30 degrees.
Currently, it is a priority to get the results of the examination as soon as possible, but these can take several months, perhaps even a year.
Gilberto L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Meyer, Director General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat of Aircraft and Auxiliary Services in Mexico), assured that the helicopter was flown by the Estado Mayor Presidential at travel speed and the aircraft fell on a soft slope.
"This information reinforces the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of the impact."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come, listed six relevant points that should be taken into account in the investigation:
Vision flight:
In accordance with the flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of sight flight, which means that the crew must have had sufficient visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded suitable weather conditions at the start, and as it continued to fly towards the border area between Mexico City and the State of Mexico, some deep-hanging clouds appeared.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that the team had chosen a lower area with better view towards the Cuernavaca Valley due to the clouds.
Point of impact:
The impact coordinates and the last radar record of the helicopter are the same, and there may have been no loss of control over the aircraft or deviation from the flight path before the impact.
Scattering of the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available to date indicates that the helicopter was impacted from a straight and lateral direction.
The pattern of the scattered aircraft giants suggests that the helicopter was impacted to the ground with its intact structure.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
The remains of the aircraft offer at the accident site do not lead to fire or explosion.
The latest findings indicate several soil contacts.
During the on-site investigations, aircraft parts were found at an altitude of 9,200 feet above sea level. The terrain is sloped and has an inclination of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter is likely to have broken down.
Some information suggests that the helicopter may have had several ground contacts.
After a minutiae search in an area beyond the locked area at the crash site, no scattered aircraft parts could be found, which reinforces the assumption that the undamaged aircraft structure was impacted against the ground.
MSS Announces Research Protocol to Find the Gene for Obesity
The Social Insurance Institution of Mexico is leading a research project to find the gene for obesity in children and adolescents, which is supported by specialists of the IPN.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social Insurance Institution of Mexico) announced that it is leading a research project to discover the gene for obesity in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of obesity in childhood and youth", with which the genetic markers associated with obesity are to be found.
Miguel Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, head of the Unidad de Investigaci<0xC3><0xB3>n Médica en Bioqu<0xC3><0xAD>mica (Department of Medical Research, Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, explained that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was formed.
This team is supported by specialists and students of the postgraduate program at the Instituto Nacional de Salud P<0xC3><0xBA>blica (INSP) and the Centro de Investigaci<0xC3><0xB3>n y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) of the Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interested parties can come to the IMSS sports grounds in the Valley of Mexico, where tests with children and adolescents are carried out every Saturday from 8:00 am.
He emphasized that the investigation began on the Cuauhtémoc sports field (in the west of the state of Mexico) and has been continued since October 8 on the Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yolt sports field (in the east of the state of Mexico).
When the target of 500 to 600 subjects is reached, the study will be continued on the Independencia sports field (in the south of the capital district) and completed on the Morelos sports field (in the north of the capital district).
He explained that the aim of the study was to learn about the factors and the role of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify risk factors of Mexican children and adolescents for the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the World Diabetes Day, he stated that it is intended that three thousand children and adolescents between the ages of six and 14 should complete dietary questionnaires with the consent and supervision of their parents.
They will also be asked questions about their physical activity and their family history of illness in order to control risk factors that could result in diabetes or kidney failure.
He also concluded that on the aforementioned Saturdays, the subjects measured (weight, size, waist circumference), their blood pressure was controlled and blood values such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (an attempt to identify genes related to obesity in childhood) would be determined.
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez stressed that this study would be carried out on the occasion of the concern of health professionals about the alarming weight gain of young people.
"The 1999 and 2006 health surveys showed that in just under six years, the proportion of obese boys increased by 77 percent and that of girls with obesity by 47 percent, and obesity also increased dramatically," the IMSS specialist emphasized.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the people of Mexico differed from that of other peoples.
He stated that an average Mexican is 65 percent Native American, 30 percent European and 5 percent African, which is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and obesity.
Quite generally, he explained, the genetics of obesity is expressed in the inability to burn the excess energy (calories) taken from us, so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the study participants would be a comprehensive study of the children, which would determine whether they exhibited a degree of overweight or obesity.
It would even investigate the occurrence of dark skin folds in the neck and inner arm (acanthosis), which indicate the likelihood of metabolic disorders and diabetes in the pre-stage.
All information would be treated confidentially and communicated to the parents in writing by the doctors. The doctors will explain to the parents all the measurement results and suggest lifestyle changes that are appropriate for the prevention of diseases.
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez explained that there are three basic factors that are responsible for overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of movement, that is, lack of movement in everyday life, spending most of the day in front of the TV and using means of transportation, instead of walking short distances.
The high calorie intake, that is, an increased consumption of sugary drinks and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) together with a high fat and protein intake as well as the genetics to be analyzed in this research project.
Asphalt from UNAM prevents impact holes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the Mexican University UNAM develops polymer-modified asphalts to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
Respecting the signs coming out of the road pavement, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200,000 bump holes if the rainy season in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (city area of the Valley of Mexico) breaks out, said Rafael Herrera N<0xC3><0xA1>jera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry, who was putting up so much damage to the pavement at the University of Applied Sciences (FQ).
In his lecture "Stroke holes from a technical point of view", which he held on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible develops polymer-modified asphalts to produce a mixture similar to asphalt, which, however, exhibits a greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera N<0xC3><0xA1>jera argued that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climates, such as in some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behavior of the road surface and thus avoid the appearance of impact holes.
He explained that the asphalt - the heaviest part of petroleum - is a hydrocarbon compound, some of which has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphalts - and the other part a low - the so-called malthenes. Together they give the road surface its characteristic tough elastic behavior.
Tightening elastic behavior of the asphalt means that it behaves like a liquid at high temperatures of almost 180° C., at 120° C. it is very tightly liquid and at 50° C. it is almost solid, while it becomes brittle at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resistance of the asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but changes in one day depending on the weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," the chemical engineer said.
The FQ researcher noted that the streets of Mexico City have a mostly flexible road surface, consisting of six layers of material, the last three of which contained asphalt.
Between the top layers lies an abrasion layer of asphalt, consisting of small, asphalt-soaked and then hardened stones.
Every single stone of this wear layer had been bathed in asphalt.
If the vehicles move on it and forces are generated, this layer allows a good distribution of forces in the road surface.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would be even better distributed," said the chemical engineer.
"Over the wear layer," he concluded, "a final layer is laid out, the so-called support layer, which consists of tiny stones, i.e., sand, which was also bathed in asphalt.
Since this layer is in contact with the vehicle tires, they require a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and it needs to produce friction.
This road surface receives and distributes most of the forces, the support layer also needs a suitable thickness and the material from which it is made must be maintained.
The weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to take into account, especially the water," he said, "because it significantly affects the behavior of the wear layer.
When the terrain becomes wet, water enters the layer and only enters difficult again. This causes softening of all layers of the road surface and, as a result, the appearance of impact holes.
When a percussion hole is created, he said, "the cover layer will be removed at first, while the wear layer will only be affected after that. But the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that should be maintained at the first signs by appropriate maintenance programs."
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National Research System of Mexico) stated that the vehicle load is another important cause of the appearance of impact holes. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of the road surface must always be in relation to the vehicle load and it must be ensured that to avoid frequent impact holes these rules
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there was still a lot of research to be done, for example on asphalt emulsions, which were already on the market in other countries, and with which the perforations could be repaired easily and without the application of high temperatures.
What was missing from the candidate del Valle to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna’s failure to receive the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle wins its 14th title.
Once again Valle del Cauca went empty when the crown was awarded to Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna had to settle for standing on the winning podium, displaying a silver crown and the band that marks her as the new Miss Colombia.
With the result obtained that night in Cartagena (Gir<0xC3><0xB3>nica), where Miss Atl<0xC3><0xA1>ntico took over the crown and the cedar (Gir<0xC3><0xB3>nica) (Gir<0xC3><0xB3>nica) (Gir<0xC3><0xB3>nica) (Gir<0xC3><0xB3>nica) (Gir<0xC3><0xB3>nica), where Miss Atl<0xC3><0xA1>ntico took over the crown and the cedar (Gir<0xC3><0xB3>nica) (Gir<0xC3><0xB3>nica) (Gir<0xC3><0xB3>nica) (Gir<0xC3><0xB3>nica) (Gir<0xC3><0xB3>nico) (Gir<0xC3><0xB3>nico) (Gir<0xC3><0xB3>) (Gir<0xC3><0xB3>) (Gir<0xC3><0xB3>) (Gir<0xC3><0xB3>) (Gir<0xC3><0xB3>) (Gir<0xC3><0xB3>) (Gir<0xC3><0xB3>) (Gir<0xC3><0xB3>) (Gir<0xC3><0xB3>) (Gir (Gir (Gir<0xC3><0xB3>) (Gir<0xC3><0xB3>) (Gir<0xC3><0xB3>) (Gir<0xC3><0xB3>) (Gir) (Gir<0xC3><0xB3>) (Gir (Gir (Gir<0xC3><0xB3>) (Gir) (Gir (Gir (Gir) (Gir) (Gir (Gir) (Gir) (Gir (Gir) (Gir<0xC3><0xB3>) (Gir) (Gir) (Gir) (Gir) (Gir) (Gir (Gir) (Gir (Gir (Gir (Gir (Gir (Gir (Gir)))) (Gir (Gir (Gir (Gir (Gir (Gir (Gir))) (Gir))) (Gir)))))) (Gir) (Gir) (Gir (Gir) (Gir) (Gir (Gir (Gir) (Gir<0xC3><0xB3>))) (Gir)) (Gir<0xC3><0xB3> (Gir) (Gir ()) (Gir)) () (Gir<0xC3><0xB3>) (Gir))) (Gir) () (Gir)) () (Gir () (Gir (Gir) (Gir (Gir () () (Gir) () (Gir) (Gir<0xC3><0xB3> (Gir) () () (Gir () () ())) () () () () ())) () () (Gir (Gir () () (Gir) () () (Gir (Gir () () (Gir) () () () () () () () (Gir) (Gir) (Gir) (Gir) (Gir) (Gir) (Gir) (Gir) (Gir (Gir) (Gir) ()))) (Gir) (Gir () () () () () () () () () () () () () ()
The big question that many people are asking today is: What is missing?
Because the result corresponds to the decline of a great favorite, who had shown at each performance that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. Not for nothing she had been elected the Queen of the Police and the Best Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles that had also been awarded to the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro the House of the Crown, and the
The first factor that is considered crucial to the jury’s decision to appoint her as First Miss is that she had not convinced the answer to the question “Which book has influenced you the most and why?” asked to her by Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n Murillo G<0xC3><0xB3>mez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:
“I read a lot, I pretty much believe in literature, I think it’s a way to civilize myself, ultimately I think the book that shaped my childhood the most, ‘The Little Prince’, is a pretty deep going book.
I am currently reading <0x60>Schuld und Sühne'. It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I am currently reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called <0x60>Passions'.
A response that met with little dislike, firstly because of the term 'civilization' and secondly because it had not explained in concrete how each of her books had influenced her.
But at the end of the ceremony, Melina declared to feel calm and happy with the result: “The universe is wise, it happens what has to happen.
And for all the people: Please read a little 'The Little Prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the favorite of El Valle has burned out.
A journalist from Bogota suggested that the fact that she was the favorite, who had received all the congratulations and who had received all the awards in advance (gastronomy competition Easter, audience vote on the best hand-tailored costume and Reina Madre), "had not made the other candidates jealous of the Queen's jealousy, the other candidates had not made the Queen's jealous.
And this was evident in her first performance in the bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton hotel and in her two elevators at the coronation ceremony.
Although she appeared safely in both, she lacked the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atl<0xC3><0xA1>ntico displayed.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for the Como en casa program at RCN, said that the fact that Melina was crowned miss "shows that the candidate who wins the most awards during the competition will not be queen after all."
In addition, Valle went out of the way at the end of the press - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the jury about her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
It will already have its reason that two days before the compilation of the international jury, Lucy Doughty stated that they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social affairs of her country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. You have to look beyond the physical and focus on the social feeling that she had already participated in projects before participating in the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her defects of the derriere and the fibrosis that she was noticed in the stomach area. But this is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for <0x60>natural beauty' with a healthy body, good eating habits and responsible workers.
The queens’ coach, Jorge Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Orozco, admits that Melina didn’t have the best body, that there would be better, “but her problem with abdominal fibrosis, which I honestly hardly noticed, pushed her score on the last day.”
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos believes that the mistake of the woman from Valle del Cauca was the surgical procedures she had undergone.
"The operations are okay, but Valle didn't know how to get them to do it right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this point she had to pay for."
Because of this award, which is awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Contest, a cruel prediction was made after the appearance in the swimsuit, which was supposed to come true at night. It was rumored that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize in order not to let her enjoy the crown.
Whether this is true or not, the fact is that from today, Melina will enter her reign, not as a queen but as a princess, a position that will give her the opportunity to represent Colombia at one of the international competitions on the nomination of the National Beauty Contest.
However, she becomes one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena, had escaped the crown, going into history.
This was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A lophoscopist from Cali went down in history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials plays a key role.
On November 4, a lophoscopist of the Cali State Prosecutor’s Office’s Investigation Unit (CTI) went in as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia – Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) by comparing the fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists in the CTI department, this week Eliazar Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez had preparedness service, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been involved in criminal investigations for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez worked in communities of Choc<0xC3><0xB3>, where he often had to go to the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies he was supposed to identify were located.
In 2000 he moved to Valle over and after completing the required courses he specialized in lophoscopy, that is, the examination of the skin that is exposed to friction, i.e. the palms and feet.
In the week of the operation against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was told to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
Friday night he flew in a helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he should identify two bodies, and that there was a suspicion that one of them might be that of the man who had led the oldest guerrilla in the world, so he should take the ten-finger imprint of Guillermo Le<0xC3><0xB3>n S<0xC3><0xA1>enz (his real name).
However, when he reached the place where the body was found with the test, he could not identify him because of his physical appearance, because this was not in the least similar to the images he had seen in the mass media.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer in the area, did not wear glasses and was very much thinner.
Fingerprints don’t lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a planting cell and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body to those on the imprint sheet.
He said it was Alfonso Cano.
The same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for informing the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinz<0xC3><0xB3>n, that he was in fact the head of the FARC.
Searching for clues
For a dactyloscopic from the Sij<0xC3><0xAD>n in Cali, the appreciation that President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez gave at a press conference on the use of "Cano" was very important.
Many people do not know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science with no error rate, which can be a key factor in the resolution of a crime.
Lophoscopists not only identify bodies, they also support investigations into murder and robbery cases and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
At the time of their arrest, many criminals present false ID documents or they do not have any.
We take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The researcher told us that he had to tear a piece of wall out of a house in the event of a theft, because the thief had supported himself with his hand right here when he pulled out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"Walls are difficult because their surfaces are unsuitable for fingerprinting, but in this case we were able to take the whole hand print and identify the offender who participated in several thefts," he recalled.
With the help of fingerprints, murder suspects can also be relieved or charged.
Recently, a dead man was found surrounded by bottles of candy.
In the investigation, it was suspected that a family member might be suspicious, and in fact, a fingerprint on the bottle matched.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the murderer, it is still associated with the place where the crime was committed.
A CTI daktyloscopist explained that "the fingerprints would be taken from the object with chemical or physical reagents."
When they appear, a planting cell or band is used to carry them.
Afterwards, the prints are sent to Asif, the criminal database, or to the People's Office.
“The problem is that there are still many Colombians without IDs,” the CTI expert said.
He said not everything was as it would be in the TV series SCI.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not everything that you touch is a fingerprint.
But it can still be used if a corresponding comparison is made.
The "Emportes" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in tents on Zuccotti Square.
Most of them complied with the evacuation order and changed their location to a nearby park.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged New York authorities on Tuesday as they tried to re-enter Manhattan Square with a court order after being cleared of the square at dawn and trying to occupy another place on the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators rallied in front of Zuccotti Square, to which they wanted to gain access with a court order that allowed the "Empörten" to re-tent in this place. Meanwhile, another part of the movement adhered to the evacuation order and occupied a park further to the north of the city.
“Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp on the square, we will meet in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations,” said Mark Bray, one of the spokespersons for the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray argued that the "embarrassment" response to the evacuation of their tent camp, which had been ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came before the court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order banning the violent evacuation of the square and allowing protesters to take up the tent.
In addition, the "Emportes" occupied a new park, which is located at the intersection of centrally located Canal Street and Sixth Avenue very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey and is owned by Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the place for at least an hour. But after that, police came in and arrested some of the protesters, although Bray can not give accurate figures. He assured the news agency Efe that he also saw several journalists with handcuffs.
The organization said hundreds of people had gathered at this spot, where a delegation of religious leaders had also arrived as a sign of their support for the members of the movement and for mediation with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti square (a privately owned site) remains closed in anticipation of a court hearing, which is scheduled for this Tuesday, in which the legality of the eviction in the morning will be analyzed.
Some of the square-driven demonstrators carried photocopies of this court order with them and distributed them to some policemen who guarded the square, resulting in "some small clashes", as Bray reported, who had indicated that some policemen had beaten demonstrators.
The court order prohibits the authorities from clearing members of Occupy Wall Street and the application of "laws passed after the occupation and prohibiting the protesters from returning to the park with their tents and other items they had previously used."
Mayor Bloomberg made it clear to the press that due to this court order, the reopening of the square for public transport and the demonstrators had been lifted. The demonstrators pointed out that the city laws did not allow them to settle again with tents and sleeping bags in this place.
The mayor personally defended the clearing of Zuccotti Square, which was carried out at dawn, in which nearly 200 people were arrested, and which was decided because the demonstrators "rejected the law."
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to clear the square because it had "turned into a place where people did not come to demonstrate, but to break the laws and in some cases to harm other people", because "some businesses would have received threats" and residents feared "for their quality of life".
“The clearing at dawn was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is fundamentally interested in protecting the financial interests and not in protecting the interests of North American workers,” the spokesman added, accusing the mayor of “not respecting press freedom.”
“Occupy Wall Street officials said they were thinking of organising “great actions” for Thursday, together with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months that the protests have been going on since September 17.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary in the TV Christmas Show
Along with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will appear on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", rescue swimmer in "Baywatch", rabbit in "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary at a Christmas show on Canadian television.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the "crooner" (ballet singer) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, will appear on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 and breathe life into a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television show in which Anderson - who also appears on the Internet for the dissemination of self-made porn, in which she appears together with her former husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee - as the Virgin Mary with a doll in the lap, which is supposed to represent Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin, who recently worked as a moderator on Charlie Sheen’s “My Violent Torpedo of Truth,” appears as a Jesus child.
CTV’s Christmas program not only focuses on Anderson and Peters, but also on Canadian singer Bublé, who married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato at the end of March in Buenos Aires, and who is not far from this controversy.
Bublé recently described North American Kim Kardashian as “hurry” at one of his concerts in New York.
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the free-fall spiral from the beginning of March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still recovering from the devastating earthquake that led to a nuclear crisis, and the worst disaster Japan had experienced since World War II.
The government’s first estimates in Tokyo estimated the property damage at $300,000, a blow that seems to be weakening despite the difficult global economic situation.
After three quarters of cases, the data on gross domestic product from July to September finally served to complete this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% at the rate calculated for the year.
The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery can be explained in part by the sale of machinery for the reconstruction of the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1% compared to a 0.9% decline for capital investments recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of relentless growth.
Nevertheless, the actual turnaround of the Japanese economy is not solely based on Keynesian impulses that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructure.
Japan has awakened, in particular, thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable rose by 1%, driven by growing spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The Stigma of the Yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market after the yen – the Japanese currency – became one of investors’ “refugee currencies” fleeing the eurozone’s debt crisis and murky forecasts for the U.S., a privilege that weighs like a tombstone on the accounts of export companies.
With a harder currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of major technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, led their weak business results from July to September back to the listing of the yen.
While the markets continue to besiege the peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government remains vigilant.
“You have to pay attention to the continuing risks, for example, the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid upgrading of the yen,” said Motohisa Furukawa, Secretary of State for Economic Policy.
The prospects are really not very encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said that most member states had shown clearer signs of a slowdown in economic development in September.
The indicator, which predicts the turning points of the world economy, revealed that the biggest economic potentials would have been the brakes.
Because it fell by four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
The euro area is even below this average value, which is at 100, after falling by eight-tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens has once again raised doubts.
Papadimos says austerity measures would be adopted, but Conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the periphery countries’ high risk premiums and widening uncertainty, Greece continues to get lost in the maze that emerges from the major European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is more of a reaction to pressure from Brussels than a genuine conviction of political forces is slowly evidenced by facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday pointed out that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the hundred days agreed upon in his appointment may be too short for their implementation, the leader of the conservative party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured Dat that he would not back the election, support the new austerity measures.
"The most important task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the October 26 summit," Papadimos assured yesterday at the opening of a parliamentary debate, which will culminate tomorrow with the confidence vote for the new government.
A package of 24 employment promotion programmes, disciplinary law reform for officials and new anti-tax evasion measures are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samaras' message does not eliminate the doubts about his stance: "We have committed ourselves to the support of the transitional government, but to nothing else."
The conservative leader went one step too far with his challenge to the EU and the IMF, the body that needs to unlock the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and made it clear that he would not approve of a commitment to meet the austerity measures.
But the European Commission, which is still irritated by the impact of the poker game with the Papandreou referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand should not be shaken: the economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties did not "under a clear written agreement" as soon as possible.
Amadeu Altafaj, a spokesman for the Ministry of Economy, said the troika’s inspectors would return to Athens “very soon” to discuss with the new government “what is needed for the payment of the sixth section” of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8,000 million, although there is no final date yet.
The Greek knot has threads for a while.
Queen Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a: "These are instruments of progress and hope"
The Queen stressed the "dominant" position of Spain with regard to this type of financing
Spain "has achieved a predominant position worldwide in the role of microfinance".
Queen Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a of Spain recalled yesterday that in the last two decades Spain has become the second donor worldwide for this means of international cooperation. Its "essence" is based on the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all mankind on the basis of trust".
The Queen inaugurated the fifth World Summit on Small Loans in Valladolid yesterday. She was convinced that there would be "no doubt" that this type of business would be "absolutely essential" to achieve the United Nations' Millennium Goals by 2015, with "the goal of having a small number of people, in particular the dollar,
Spain "continues to work" on the expansion of the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world and it carries out this task responsibly", noted Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions that will start from the summit, which lasts until Thursday, will be "particularly guaranteed as the creation of new opportunities and opportunities for women".
"We have achieved many successes" and "are facing many challenges."
The summit on microfinance is not only a forum for debate, but also a platform for the impetus of "two fundamental goals".
The Queen stated that it is intended that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families will have access to these financial services and that ten million of these households will exceed the poverty line.
The concept of the smallest loans in Spain and the rest of the world goes back to the path initiated by Muhammad Yunus "years ago", which Queen Sofia considers an "act of justice and recognition".
She described the father of this funding instrument as an "admirable idealist who has dedicated himself to the fight against poverty" and whose work she has known for 15 years when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to get to know the lending strategy on the spot.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and further meetings on the Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. At all, "we have been able to observe a continuous development", explained the Queen, whose commitment to this project was yesterday judged by her as "family head" in Valladolid and as "
Finally, Queen Sofia ended her talk by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and to seek solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Commandment"
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "an ethical commandment" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was a mistake to tie development aid to times of economic booms, because it was a "permanent commitment".
Jiménez was of the opinion that microcredit is a “serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty”, and that the governments of the developed countries should now “more than ever” work on solidarity criteria, and should not allow solidarity to fall victim to the crisis.
For Spain, minimum loans are one of the "most important forms of development aid".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, lamented "the success", "marginalized" people who "always stand in front of closed doors" "hope" to give "the hope" to the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Le<0xC3><0xB3>n de la Riva, welcomed the attendees in a city that "appears to their doors"
The CDU proposes to elect the EU president on the basis of general voting
The first day of the Congress of Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, November 14 in Leipzig went for Angela Merkel, chancellor and chairman of the Christian Democratic Party, without real difficulties.
The future of Europe was not originally foreseen in the programme, but it was enforced in the autumn, in particular to suffice for those activists who regard the government's policy towards the Greeks today and possibly Italy tomorrow as too lax.
The Presidency proposal of the European Commission, proposed by the Bureau, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine had voted against, ten had abstained.
The standing ovation lasting several minutes, which initially applied to Angela Merkel and a few hours later to Wolfgang Schäuble due to their intervention decrees, left no doubt on the part of the three European finance ministers.
The Chancellor's main idea - as well as the request - bears the following slogan: the answer to the crisis is "not less, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could be expressed by a modification of the Treaty of Lisbon which reinforces the control of the European Union with regard to the budgetary policies of the countries in the euro area; however, this could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote "to give Europe a face".
However, this is certainly one of the motions adopted by Congress, which clearly stood for Wolfgang Schäuble.
Certainly, it is unlikely that the 47 will quickly agree on this revolution: Great Britain is opposed to the matter, and the leaders of the CDU believe to know that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.
However, the milestone has been set.
Likewise, the delegates, by an overwhelming majority, rejected the proposal for the weighting of each country on the Governing Board of the ECB in accordance with the weighting of the individual economies, which obviously entailed a strengthening of Germany’s position.
The chancellor, who is thinking about calming the climate within her party, has therefore strengthened the reference points to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she has no longer tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" or the European countries in difficulty, which would immediately criticize the arrogant Germany.
As far as the European proposal on the importance of "German-French friendship" is concerned, Angela Merkel is not calling France on the agenda.
At least not directly.
This reminds us that two centuries ago Leipzig was at the center of a bloody battle.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does the fraud in sick reports represent?
After the family grants, UMP and the government are now attacking the disease reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15, to seek out a family support fund and deliver a speech on the - ever-recurrent since 2007 - issue of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the state.
In order to accompany this attack, which stems from the effort to put the economy to the test, but on the other hand represents no less predictive of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on employee sick reports.
Firstly, with budgetary objectives: the government intends to introduce a fourth day of waiting before taking into account a sick report for employees in the private sector.
In good German, this means that a sick employee would lose the four-day wage without the specific company’s permission, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
An opinion that, according to the daily newspaper "Les Echos" threatens to incite anger, but would help to contribute 280 million euros.
And that went hand in hand with another measure of a rather symbolic character: to grant state officials an unpaid day of waiting in the event of illness (so far, unlike the three days of waiting in the private sector, there is no waiting period).
While these issues are in the discussion, the majority also rekindles the issue of fraud, this time targeting the abuse associated with absenteeism.
"Controls will be much more important, and in addition, they are to be reimbursed if required," Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday, November 13, in front of the RTL's microphone.
As in other cases, the impact of this report on the reality of fraudulent activities in the field of sick reports seems to be somewhat disproportionate.
In fact, this has been the subject of constant observation since 2002, as well as political offensives that have borne the most fruit.
The French are no longer more sick than people elsewhere in Europe.
However, let us first dwell on the country-wide figures.
According to the Landeskrankenkasse CNAM, more than 237 million euros in daily allowances were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Economic Research and Documentation of Health, daily allowances in 2008 amounted to EUR 11.3 billion and accounted for 5% of health expenditure.
This figure was 46% for maternity leave and accidents at work and 54% for sick leave, i.e. 6.2 billion euros.
That is 2.5% of health care spending.
According to a study by the Alma Consulting Group, in 2010, the French were given an average of only 14.5 sick days compared to the 17.8 days in 2009.
An average that obscures some differences: Another, published in 2007 by Monster.com, a career planning website, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French workers surveyed said they had not taken a single day of sick leave.
Another study, this time compiled by health insurance, makes it clear that 37% of disease reports in 2010 were of shorter duration than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and a month, 15% between one and three months, and 11% above.
Compared to their European neighbours, French workers are no more likely to become incapacitated than elsewhere.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers of the French State Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001, the global absenteeism rate (based on disease or otherwise) fluctuated between 10% and 11% in France versus 20% and 28% in Denmark and 16% in the United Kingdom.
Fraud in sick leave accounts for a dissipatingly small proportion of black work.
With regard to the fraud, only a weak margin is achieved here.
The strengthening of the legislation since 2002 implies that there are systemic checks for reports of illness that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public university for training and further training of technicians and engineers) under 1.5 million controls found that 13% of the 285,000 realized, short-term reports of illness, which is in 37,050 cases, were "unjustified or too long".
Systematically controlled cases of more than 45 days duration accounted for less than 1.2 million 11% of "unsuitable or unjustified" cases, i.e. 132,000.
In total, this makes 169,000 "unjustified" cases per several million workers who have filed a sick report.
A figure that represents only a weak margin compared, for example, to that of black work.
According to UMP MP Dominique Tian, author of a case report on this issue published in July, this represents between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 billion in tax breaks per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily allowances, and thus significantly more than defrauding in the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan
Greece is in need of a new adjustment programme to catch up with its economy.
This had announced on Monday, November 14, the Prime Minister Lucas Papademos before the Parliament, appended to the fact that the 100 days granted by his government by the Union were not enough to accomplish this task.
"In order to continue our efforts to strengthen the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," the head of government said in his first public speech at the opening of the debate on Parliament's confidence vote on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken on the occasion of the Euro Summit on 27 October is the "main task" of the new government, as the country's involvement within the eurozone would be "at stake", he added.
Accordingly, M. Papademos has planned to reduce the country's government deficit "about 9%" of the gross domestic product from today until the end of the year, after this in 2010 was 10.6% and in 2009 at 15.7%.
The rights reject the new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, head of the right wing, had on Monday given his approval to the already approved rulings regarding an attempt to escape the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not be ready for an additional austerity vote.
"We will not vote in favor of new opinions," he told a parliamentary assembly of his New Democracy party.
He had agreed to reduce the budget deficit and debt, as well as the fight against waste, but he was hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, EU Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who had prevented the IMF and the EU from releasing the necessary loan of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8 billion without a written guarantee from all parties about their support for the planned measures, had replied that his word would suffice and he would under no pressure from the European Commission.
Euthanasia and Accompanied Free Death Must Be Legalized, Expert Panel Says
Canadians live in denial of death, according to a report by the Royal Society of Canada
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relieving drugs, and beyond, cancer cases.
Canadian society is living in a denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually agree to talk to their doctor about conditions under which they want to die and make dispositions for that purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada involving six experts linked in various fields, including ethics, law, and medicine.
This body recommends that the government amend the penal law in such a way as to allow accompanying suicide and euthanasia where this choice takes place, in patients who are considered capable of making such a decision.
As a start, the experts cite a recently published survey by the independent society EIU, which had compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the globe with each other.
Although Canada ranks 10th, the study notes that “medical dying care in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to cut the issue of death.”
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians do not have access to painkillers, according to experts commissioned by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the majority of Canadians’ desire to die at home, 68.6% of them eventually die in hospital.
Considered from across the country, the rate of hospitalized deaths in Quebec is the highest at 86%.
In the delicate question of euthanasia and accompanying suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that do not want to make any changes to the penal law regarding euthanasia and accompanying suicide, contrary to the position of the federal government, which has already violated.
Now, according to the experts, who have equally inspected all those countries whose approach legalized or decriminalized euthanasia and accompanying suicide, there is no evidence that such decriminalization would migrate in their application, that is, the practice of euthanasia or unwilling to accompany suicidal people.
On the contrary, there are significantly more cases of such violations in countries where euthanasia and accompanying suicide are not legalised, as Jocelyn Downie, co-signator of the report, confirmed in a teleconference yesterday.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Accompaniment suicide is also practiced in Canada, although clearly illegal here," Jocelyn Downie explains.
Canadians support euthanasia
According to an Angus-Reid survey conducted in 2010, 85% of Canadians have already committed themselves to euthanasia, as they believe that it allows people at the end of their lives to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that the fact of legalization of euthanasia does not have the effect of conveying the message that the lives of older or disabled people have less value.
With regard to those who have already committed an accompanying suicide, 41% of respondents are of the opinion that they should not be prosecuted.
As far as patient maintenance or treatment is concerned, the situation is less clear, according to the report's authors.
Similarly, they suggest in their list of recommendations that the Criminal Code should specify that the withdrawal of funds for which there is a legal refusal should not be considered criminal.
The panel of experts also calls for health professionals to be trained in the task of respecting the end-of-life cessation of funds, and to fear this without criminal prosecution.
The panel explained that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relieving drugs, and beyond, cancer cases.
Lastly, the panel calls for at least consideration of the pain-relieving or life-absorbing measures already widely used in Canadian health care institutions, as these were as little used as euthanasia to reduce physical pain and reduce it to the same level as euthanasia.
Reservations of other experts
Some experts in the legal field of health care have already made reservations regarding the conclusions of the Royal Society of Canada expert report.
RA Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has called the attitude of the reporting experts "extreme" among other things, as they do not set any limits to the practice of euthanasia in patients in the final phase.
“This opens the door for a situation where anyone who is life-tired and over the age of 18 is asking another person to assist him in his suicide,” said RA Deschamps, who had reviewed a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also emphasizes that the authors of the report seemed to place the individual's own responsibility above all other values involved in the social fabric of society.
But now, he says, there would be "guidelines and commitments in a society".
Margaret Somerville, a specialist in health law, also expressed "strong resistance" to the report's conclusions, which she dubbed the "pro-euthanasia manifesto".
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, particularly doubts reports of non-existence of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and accompanying suicide are legalized, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordan's King Calls for President Assad to Resign
Damascus calls for a "complot"
Syria is becoming more isolated.
The Bashar al-Assad partisans demonstrated in front of the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday.
Diplomatic pressure on Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, who, thanks to Russia’s support, is resisting it and is pointing out a “complot” directed against the country, has intensified yesterday.
Two days before Syria was expelled by the Arab League, the European Union tightened its sanctions against Damascus, even though Turkey and Jordan, Syria’s neighbors, had taken a position in favor of President Assad’s resignation.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the incumbent Arab Prime Minister who had called on President Bashar al-Assad to “depose his office in Syria” in which some forty civilians and members of the government were already killed.
"If Bashar had the interest of his country at heart, he would resign, but in addition, he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of political Syrian life," the king of Jordan, Syria's neighbor, said in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu complained that Turkish mediation efforts aimed at the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been successful.
"Those in the Middle East who are not at peace with their people and cannot satisfy them must leave," he said, referring to Syria, the neighboring country to which Turkey is taking a increasingly harsh stance.
The United States, for its part, welcomed the "intensification of the consensus against Assad and the machinations of the Syrian regime" as a result of the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
“The international community, the United States, the European Union, the Arab League and countries like Turkey have struck an increasingly sharp tone in the face of repression in Syria,” said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of government power were killed in the Dar’a region in southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) announced.
Two other civilians were killed in "shooting shifts and heavy bombings around Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
On the occasion of a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallim nevertheless believed that the country "taxes towards the end of the crisis".
By the way, he has reacted strongly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from its duties, which he considers to be a "dangerous step".
“Syria will not give in,” he added, adding that “the plots forged against Syria would fail.”
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently investigating a "protection mechanism for civilians" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers to the country.
French Trade Minister Alain Juppé had also spoken out in favour of sending UN observers to protect civilians from regime repression that encapsulates him in his "paranoia".
A planned re-assembly of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the crisis response plan decided on November 2, but in particular the controversial, expected withdrawal of military troops from the besieged cities, as well as the release of detained demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called the Arab League's decision "incorrect" yesterday to guard against advocating possible sanctions against Damascus, even though China had already warned Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti urges markets to be patient and Italy to be willing to sacrifice
Mario Monti, the future Italian head of government, has demanded a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a program that "demands victims" to regain the credit lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU Commissioner had held a negotiation with the political parties yesterday before today's meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was his task to convene a cabinet in Parliament, which was composed of relatively strict external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the numerous smaller parliamentary groups participating in the talks, after meeting with the incumbent President-in-Office of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, the president of the Chamber of Deputies, had been waiting for Mario Monti to submit a vote of confidence to parliament by Friday to make sure that the new government had sufficient support.
The agreements will culminate in the presentation by Mr Monti of a deletion list, which will undoubtedly range from a dozen ministers to the head of state Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti commented that yesterday’s nervousness in the stock and bond markets was demanding their time.
In "a democracy, there are certain deadlines" to prepare a government as well as a government program, he stressed, noting that it is "certain that the markets will be patient and understanding".
His order by the president was initially welcomed by the markets, but the turmoil had intensified thereafter, especially after an unexpected drop in industrial output in the eurozone in September.
The incumbent prime minister was to establish a staff consisting mainly of technocrats, although he had stressed that he would also like to involve "politicians".
The new government should only exist until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the president of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should receive the confidence of Parliament by Friday.
Mr Monti has committed himself since his inauguration to working urgently to make Italy a "new protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman for EU Commissioner Olli Rehn had stressed that "our diagnosis with regard to the Italian economy itself does not change, taking into account the new government".
In particular, the EU, which is convinced that Rome will not meet its budgetary balance target in 2013, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for new toughness measures.
Emma Marcegaglia, Italy's chief executive, who will meet at Monti on Tuesday, also insists on the need for economic stimulus, "because a country that has no growth, which cannot respect deficit figures".
M. Monti, known for his competence and independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for an "epochal change" of Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "Professor" symbolizes the "challenge of trustworthiness" as well as a "other Italy", according to the lead article authors.
The great unknown here is the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent early elections, as Italy now has to raise 200 billion euros in government bonds by April 2012.
Russian Scientist Helps Iran's Nuclear Energy Program
A Russian scientist, Vyacheslav Danilenko, has helped Iran develop a nuclear explosive device, a U.S. non-governmental organization specializing in nuclear risks confirmed on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security ISIS bases its findings on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to identify this scientist.
Last week, the IAEA announced its “serious concern” over a “possible military dimension” of Iran’s nuclear program.
According to an in-depth study of the IAEA documents by ISIS, Danilenko, born in 1934, had apparently worked at a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) for over three decades since the beginning of the 1960s and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he left the center to start a company in Kiev that produces "nano diamonds".
The economic difficulties of his company led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Prior to his return to Russia, he participated in an Iranian program from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report, the IAEA mentioned "strong indications that the Iranian development" of a nuclear explosive device "has been supported by the work of a foreign expert, who is not only highly skilled in this technology, but also, as a state member of the Agency reported, his entire career career has been focused on this military-grade technology.
Anti-Islamic Crimes and Crimes Increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racially or religiously motivated violent crimes have either slightly decreased or only slightly increased over the same period, according to FBI statistics released on Monday.
According to these data, the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. by 49%, while a 13% increase in violent crimes against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews, and a global increase of 14% in anti-religious crimes and anti-religious crimes.
The total number of “hate-motivated crimes” has risen to 6,628, including 47.3% due to racial differences and 20% due to religious differences, according to the FBI.
"Following a weakening in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes re-grow," Human Rights First said. "The rise in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant," the organization added in a communiqué.
“Human Rights First had long emphasized that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crime, should be considered a serious violation of human rights law,” said Paul Legendre, the organization’s head.
“The U.S. government can and should do more to combat these assaults,” he added, adding that this could be done by improving the police’s stance against “hate crimes.”
The "hate crime" represents in U.S. federal law as an inheritance from the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence that are directed against race, color, religion or descent, and now also includes crimes of sexual affiliation.
Twitter is changing the platform and is becoming more and more similar to Facebook
The microblogging website Twitter on Monday introduced changes in the presentation of its platform to allow its users, in particular, to watch the activities of those who follow their posts, making the service once again similar to that of Facebook.
The new tab "Activity" and another "Name" allow better readable live tracking of the activities of other "Twitters", the Internet users whose messages ("Tweets") you follow and who track your messages.
This allows you to find out if they allow you to track your messages, subscribe to new posts, favor certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer had been tested "with a small percentage of users" before its general Internet distribution on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter was known for its uninstinct functioning, packed with something esotericly suggestive wording (RT for the referenced repetition of someone else's posts). followfriday to recommend following another user) making the insiders happy, thus opening up to a wider audience with a more comparable handling to that of the mainstream Facebook and Google+ networks.
In the network, users debated about this innovation with the help of certain"tweets" over the Internet.
"This is useless, intrusive and looks like too much Facebook," <0x40>jemb123 wrote.
“The ‘Activity’ feature will help me better track certain elements of my Flux Twitter,” <0x40>dannykronstrom said.
Austro-Hungarian
Registration of a "Golden Budget Rule" in the Constitution
The ruling government of the large Social Democratic/Christian Democratic coalition in Austria on Tuesday decided to include a "Golden Budget Rule" in the constitution in order to reduce public deficits and also a possible degradation by rating agencies in the top-benefit of Austria.
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor, Werner Faymann, who had personally announced this decision of the Council of Ministers' exit, although the public debt of Austria is at 74.6%, i.e. well above the criterion of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the level of debt of countries such as Italy, Greece and the United Kingdom.
“If Austria’s ability to pay had not fallen by one stroke from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay an additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion in interest each year,” said Michael Spindelegger, deputy chancellor and minister of Christian Democratic Auvergne.
Austria is also making a call for the Brussels summit of the euro area member states on 26 October: the heads of state and government at that time would have demanded the start of reducing public deficits by the end of 2012, as well as a return to public account balance in the constitution or by passing an equivalent law.
The decision taken by the Austrian government is similar to the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to incorporate such a "rule" into the constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should be reduced by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, from 2017, the state’s structural budget deficit should not exceed the 0.35% of GDP limit, while the regional states should have balanced budgets as well as the municipalities.
The aim is to eradicate budget debt by 2020/21 under the 60% criteria set out in the Maastricht Agreement.
Strong Yen
Noda threatens new intervention in foreign exchange markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese government would again intervene in the currency markets if the yen continued to rise.
"If we find excessive volatility" in the Yen's exchange rate, we will intervene just as we did the last time," Noda told the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen, in turn, had accelerated close to the historical levels that the Japanese authorities had forced to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo had sold massive yen against the dollar to lower the Japanese currency value, which is in the process of setting a new record value against the dollar since 1945.
However, the yen has steadily risen above that, doped by purchases from investors who see the yen as “refugee value” in these uncertain times of global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro crashed under the symbolic lattice of 105 yen into the vicinity of the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was trading at around 120 yen, the euro at more than 160 yen.
This wildfire of the Japanese currency damages the exports of the archipelago, as it costs the "Made in Japan" products and reduces the income value drawn by Japanese companies from abroad, as they exchange them in national currency.
"Japan is fighting for its reconstruction after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku (northeast) region," stressed M. Noda, who fears that this escalation of the yen could kill the weak recovery already in the germ.
The third world economic power has regained traction with growth of -1.5% in the third quarter compared to the previous quarter - for the first time this year thanks to spiked export increases and consumption of households "plumped" by the disaster.
However, the prime minister estimates that the cost of the yen does not reflect "the economic foundations of Japan".
Finance Minister Jun Azumi, for his part, has called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy committee on Tuesday, to take all conceivable measures to dismantle the yen.
However, Hirohide Yamaguchi, the Institute's deputy governor, has said that the BoJ has already introduced "appropriate measures" to make it clear that no additional currency easing is to be expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting at the end of October, the central bank had increased its government bond purchases by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) to offset the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) hedges it had spent on various purchases of financial securities to overwhelm the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Interest rates fast up, exchanges make retractors
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis is constantly undermining the European key figures.
Despite the new heads of government in Greece and Italy as well as the best growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weaker countries are steadily increasing.
The stock exchanges, which are still concerned about the stability of the euro area, are also drifting a little further into negative areas on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 a.m. and fell to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt fell by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
“Due to the new tensions regarding the yields of government bonds in the troubled Eurozone, the global stock markets continue to release some of their recent profits.
“Investors are nervous and only too well aware of the risk of infection,” Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, told Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which in turn suffers from renewed fears from market participants about capacity in Europe that the debt crisis will continue, had closed with a 0.7% drop.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has turned its eyes to Europe, and trade is moving on a limited corridor of variation as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilized,” said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurgence of concern about the future of the eurozone is damaging the single currency, which continues its bailout on Tuesday.
The euro has been moving at its lowest level for a month and a half.
At 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1.3570, so it dropped by 0.4%.
According to the stockbrokers, it has declined after the CDU, the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had gathered in Congress on Monday, passed a motion that provides in particular the possibility for countries in difficulty to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% limit.
The interest rates on loans from Italy and Spain remain at a very disturbing level.
On Tuesday morning, the yield of Italian bonds reached 6.85% for 10 years, while that of Spanish securities reached 6.2%.
These interest rate tensions in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel investor fears.
The future Italian head of government Mario Monti called on the markets for more time to restore the situation in Italy threatened by the debt burden.
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, had confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken on the occasion of the Eurozone summit on 27 October were "the main task" of his government.
Spain is in the spotlight of the markets, as the parliamentary elections are held in the country on Sunday.
The spread between German and Spanish 10-year bonds has once again reached a new, historic high.
Expecting growth figures for the euro area
From a statistical point of view, France posted an economic growth driven by household consumption of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than expected 0.3%.
However, the Federal Statistical Office INSEE had revised the decline in the figures for the second quarter, with a minus of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that most worries economic experts.
Germany, on the other hand, experienced 0.5% growth over the same period.
A first euro area high is expected at 11 a.m., with the European Commission warning of the risk of another recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should prevail over dogmas
If there is one issue that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or emotions, it is certainly the energy policy.
Availability and costs of electricity directly affect the purchasing power as well as the competitiveness of companies.
It is reasonable to hold an election meeting to reflect on this issue and on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it probes the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, demographic evolution is driving a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, a huge proportion of the world’s population should not have to do without a vital element.
At the same time, we must alleviate the scarcity of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity sustainably, without forgetting the imperative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate, in order to combat climate irregularities.
The Fukushima accident does not alter any of these parameters.
As a result, Germany remains isolated in its decision to abstain from nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which submits its decision to the need to find a substitute source, nor in Switzerland, which just now intends to build only the last generation nuclear power plants.
The UK, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name just a few, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
The United States, for its part, has decided to return to Fukushima to its park by re-opening the Three Mile Island plant, which was shut down after the nuclear accident.
Even if the German model, which is oriented towards renewable energy sources, is sometimes set as a model, the reality, however, contradicts the discourse.
The election in Berlin will take the form of an increase in the price of electricity, an increased energy dependence on imported gas, in particular from Russia, and an increase in CO2 emissions from gas and coal-fired power plants.
All of these unpleasant effects will become noticeable within a few months.
The case of Denmark provides an occasion for reflection.
On the one hand, Denmark is the European leader in terms of wind energy, from which it receives 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, alternately used with wind energy; on the basis of this, its CO2 emissions and its electricity price are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the stability of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill than our French households.
As the energy price plays a key role in competitiveness in the globalised economy as well as a guarantee of stability for industry on a national level, French companies have an advantage due to the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore entail a sharp increase in the price of energy, which would make the noble statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power an illusion.
Surveys have shown that this is a price that the vast majority of French people are willing to pay just as little as they show resistance to the principle of this energy source.
Let’s face it, our country’s energy policy has made it possible to build an industry with 125.00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a large number of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises to the international markets and makes them creators of countless jobs.
Should France decide to step down from nuclear power, a large part of these SMEs would fall victim to it, and the annual <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 billion in investment goods and nuclear energy exports would shrink more and more.
Which electrician would hire an EPR designed to work for sixty years if its producer’s downfall is pre-programmed?
In order to solve the energetic equation, one has to admit that there is as little a means of generating electricity as there is a devil’s work.
The low-carbon solutions developed by Areva for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy demonstrate the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have a safety authority that performs uncompromising and transparent checks on existing plants such as the construction site in Flamanville.
Their work teams, who have made a name for themselves because of their professionalism, are just obsessed with the idea of safety.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three major disruptions.
Only one, namely in Three Mile Island, has entered under normal operating conditions, so it went without consequences for humans and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was provoked by reactor construction as well as innumerable human failure.
At Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude, which caused the deaths of several tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw its lessons from this accident just as it did after the two previous ones.
As a result of this approach, as well as the cooperation of the security authorities of the French and German operators and designers of nuclear power plants, the EPR presents a design that allows it to be resistant to such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable among the electrical engineers to build a nuclear power plant, a construction stop in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF, leaving them free to tear up the leadership position in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is inevitable and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and party maneuvers dominate a debate that also determines our country’s economic, social and financial situation.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy conducted under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from many angles - overloading of police, judicial and administrative bodies due to a policy subject to numbers, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights", as France had itself titled.
Recently, the harassment of foreign students by the government had shaped the weekly shows, the interior minister had casually announced (see Libération of 23 May) that France "needed no talents, masons or waiters from abroad".
But this policy has rarely been analysed from an economic point of view.
There is a broad consensus between the right and the left on this issue.
From the right side, the tone was struck by Jacques Chirac, who had declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed people, including over 2 million migrant workers, should not be a problem for a country", from the left side by Michel Rocard, who had explained in 1990 that France "could not absorb all the poverty of the world".
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
The fear of invasion of the national soil by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared in 2005 by both right and left.
From both camps, immigrants were perceived as a burden on the economy and French society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that one is willing to admit to the immigrants.
Francois Hollande, in his programme, confines himself to banalities that indicate that partnership development allows us to solve our "migration problems".
This notion of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may affect the elections; however, it is economically costly.
As the economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron present us in a recently published work on economics, which summarizes the latest findings on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.), there is a positive one among the specialists on the topic of economics.
Reducing immigration would deter growth and damage the labour market situation.
The fears about the influence of migrants are based on the idea that they threaten to replace local workers, in particular those with lower qualifications, by exerting pressure on their wages.
Experience shows, however, that immigrants are in fact much more complementary than domestic wage earners, as they focus heavily on occupations in sectors that are technically job-free.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract domestic wage workers, the more skilled among immigrants work in dynamic sectors where training is not equal to the job offer.
Positive Salary Effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, this complementarity between locals and migrants has a positive effect on wages and the domestic labour market situation.
In this way, Giovanni Peri calculated that a 1% increase in immigrant flooding would result in a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity introduced by immigrants is conducive to the creation of ideas and economic growth (high proportion of immigrant citizens among American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute net to social systems, on average about 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The World Labour Organization estimates, for example, that a person who immigrates to Germany at the age of 30 brings a net contribution (income minus expenses) of around 150,000 euros to the public budget on average over his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to bring about the lack of intersections "with the teeth" in the beginning of his term of office.
However, these said teeth, which should deter immigrants, achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now it remains to think about European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a sensitive asset.
The European continent should be able to remember for itself who, according to its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had let the entire 20th century over the tragedies of the First World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Francos in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the Colonel in Greece.
Some had thought it sufficient to exercise the right to vote, in the most direct way possible, to see democracy conquer its enemies once and for all.
It has been known since Napoleon "the little one" that it was a feature of the mental attitude.
The general right to vote, which is the necessary condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition for this and can just as well become the "instrument of oppression", as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot expressed at the time.
No, democracy requires far more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of powers, education, enlightenment, economic and social community spirit, jurisprudence.
The crisis in Europe in which we find ourselves is an economic crisis, but it is also a very serious and, first of all, a political and democratic crisis.
The change of mind of the Greek True False Referendum would have had a twofold revealing character in this respect: one of the necessity of a powerful return of politics, but on the other hand also of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its inadequacy.
This ambivalence should be considered outdated.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have shifted today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer aiming in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain in order to push for a success of the national referendum, which was organized according to the needs and in the wrong order.
A free pass for the European sole ruler or a leap with one eye to the void of nationalist retreat: a great choice for the citizen!
No, we want Hackebeil, but a collective task, rightly, enlightened and steady, an election and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - you no longer know where to end the enumeration - because there is only one crisis, and it is prevailing in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that is bowing to the dictation of markets and rating agencies, which suffers from its impotence and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated at the international level.
One is concerned about the transfer of sovereignty towards Europe - it is the whole of Europe that is gradually losing its sovereignty, and thus every single one of the nations attached to it.
The urgency is to give the leadership of the European project back to the sovereignty of the people.
Because it is up to the whole whether Europeans can reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from the markets and start a future through investment.
The exit from the crisis is conditional on decisions at European level that cannot be made without total democratic legitimacy, without certainly leading to our ruin.
After this proposal was fought over by Jacques Delors and the Socialists for a long time, today everyone urges the European economic leadership to do so.
Agreed.
But to imagine this without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it suggests to citizens - would be a new folly and another dead end.
We need to take on a new stage of European integration.
In order to create a republic in France, it was necessary to "create" Republicans.
The revolution of interests alone could not do enough here.
This instruction will remain valid.
We need to create a better integrated Europe at the economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a more politically democratic Europe, a truly European people's sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards become a common good
The world trade fair for chip cards opens its doors on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in an optimistic attitude.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 should actually end with an 11% increase in worldwide sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM card phone), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most important segment is the contactless technology, which allows payments in public transport or payment of purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
Compared to the 320 million sold a year ago, 460 million contactless chip cards should be sold worldwide this year!
Its market share is expected to grow further in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent over 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe is gaining ground in terms of contactless payments after it has long lagged behind the Asia-Pacific region.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 contactless visa cards were issued.
However, consumer markets are making steam.
Carrefour has therefore issued 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCards this year.
In order to move to higher speed, it is now necessary for banks to equip their customers with these cards.
“Two major French financial institutions have committed to systematically handing out to their customers in the future bank cards that are equipped with contactless chips,” said Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile phone
However, this is only a first step on the road to the payment method of the future: the mobile phone.
So far, a declining percentage of devices have been equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology necessary to carry out these transactions.
"They're late".
"But they should at least experience a real upswing next year."
“We expect to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012,” said Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the initiative.
Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are to be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
Société Générale also announced yesterday that it is preparing the launch of an offer that will allow its customers to make contactless payments via mobile phone.
Terrorist Front understands itself, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relationship between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-suspected links between the al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to be confirming.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algiers has now "acquired certainty".
"The way in which both organizations act, as well as the relations of the intelligence services, indicate a clear cooperation," he said, without going into detail.
Paris seems to be making a similar analysis.
Investigations into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January have fueled intersections.
Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, who were kidnapped by supporters of the Aqmi in a restaurant in Niamey, are said to have been killed the following day at the same time as several of their kidnappers on the occasion of an operation carried out by the French special forces.
French and Nigerian investigators want to find several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists in the debris at the site.
Terrorist Axis
The analysis of the conducted phone calls leads to several interlocutors stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: One number leads to a Nigerian who had long stayed in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is considered close to the Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but there is no doubt that we need to wait for more clear evidence before we can talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
"However, it is conceivable".
“It has been known for years that the sect is getting financial and intellectual support from Auven and that this is showing itself increasingly actively,” said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, these "support services" have become more and more apparent in their course, as have the speeches and the modes of operation of Boko Harem, which now hint at the attraction of suicide bombers and the use of increasingly complex explosives, which bear the same handwriting as those used by Aqimi.
The international community, to start with Washington, has been exerting pressure on Abuja since then to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
Indeed, the Nigerian authorities have long regarded the grouping as a community of Illuminati who need not be given special attention.
Fast Success
Founded in Maiduguri in 2002 in the vicinity of a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which in Haoussa means "Western education is a disgrace" - is pursuing the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this resourceless region, the merger is experiencing rapid successes.
It politicizes itself and demands strict adherence to Sharia law, while its affiliated activists fight against the godless central government.
The activists initially targeted churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active in their intensified attacks on the police stations.
However, Abuja’s reaction is, as usual, indifferent.
The army surrounds the city, counting 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, who was taken prisoner, is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect gradually becomes more radical and leaves its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas, she confessed to an attack in Jos that claimed 80 lives, then to another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is blamed for a suicide bombing that took place at the secure police headquarters in Abuja – the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations becomes the priority international target.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is supposed to lead from Mauritania to Nigeria to Somalia, has since alarmed all security experts.
While the Aqmi has occupied Mali and Niger, the Somalis operating from al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem appears to be a new threat at the center of the continent.
Last week, Alain Juppé, on the occasion of a conversation with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria, warned of Boko Harem and was ready to "communicate all the evidence".
The World According to Republican Presidential Candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry compete in simplification and ignorance about China, Iraq, and aid to Israel.
Can a crisis-weakened America lead a complex world with simple, if not simple, ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidate like that, the voters could almost get that impression.
For a few days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their co-defendants have repeatedly made their thundering statements, as well as their statements regarding Auven politics, the traditional Republican focus.
Slogans about China, Iran, and Israel’s aid – often not underlined in any way – fall.
With regard to the appointment of the "Grand Old Party", Mitt Romney, the highest on the list, threatened to cite the Chinese in front of the WTO and to condemn them to the "currency manipulation" - a leading issue in an America that is irritated at the top by the emigration of entire industries to Asia.
It was stupid if it meant launching a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, a former ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of outreach policy, has almost taken off the air in terms of his emotionally flattering gesture.
He had called for a hands-on but constructive exchange with Beijing (also Obama’s current stance).
But Huntsman is not being heard as he is stagnating in the depths of opinion polls.
Reagan's Ebenbild
Romney also vowed military strikes against Iran should sanctions fail to halt the nuclear program.
“If I am elected, I will order Iran to stop,” he said.
"If Obama is re-elected, they get the bomb".
He has also pledged enhanced military assistance to Israel, accusing Obama of remaining indebted to that partner’s obligations.
The businessman Herman Cain, the second-highest-placed candidate, in turn brings to the fore a shameful ignorance of the files.
Recently, he called for countering the Chinese military threat as Beijing “attempts to develop a nuclear power” – and seemed to be paying attention to the fact that China has been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military strikes against Iran, said he was ready to take the U.S. military into service in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture measures against suspected terrorists banned by Obama in 2009 was also endorsed by Cain, Perry and the candidacy of Michele Bachmann.
One is far away from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, a foreign policy heavyweight.
Against current presidential opponents, Reagan also had simple ideas and, despite all this, won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and had to pour water into his wine, as far as the issue of counter-terrorism was concerned.
They rightly insist on the failure of his na<0xC3><0xAF>ve talk with Iran, the premature withdrawal of his "boys" from Iraq, his indecisiveness in Libya, which also brought him the reputation of weakness.
However, this hostility is not so unforced.
The population is more likely to appreciate the positive balance of national security under Obama, which has shut down bin Laden.
Since Iraq, it has been guarding itself against military interventions leading to embezzlement.
And Obama surprises more appropriately by arguing that America needs to be rebuilt economically in order to revitalize its leadership position.
Nord Stream, a new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and connects Western Europe directly to Russia, has been put into operation.
It is expected to supply gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with brilliance and glory.
More than 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline, which connects Russia and Germany directly under sea level, on the Baltic coast last Tuesday under orchestral sound and at a tasty buffet.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have symbolically turned the control of the valve, which transports Russian gas to the Western European network.
The new gas long-distance line will deliver 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas per year through a first 1,224 km long pipeline connecting the St. Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to Western Europe.
A second pipeline, which allows a total supply of 55 billion cubic meters of gas - the equivalent of French total consumption - is expected to be completed by the end of 2012.
And the possibility of building a third line on the same route is already being pointed out.
For Gazprom, the timely and precise completion of this enormous building seems like a victory.
The project was highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord-Stream pipeline will allow direct gas delivery to Germany, avoiding any route through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) on the land.
For this reason, these two countries are losing some of their power: for them, it is now becoming more difficult to exert pressure on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, most strongly engaged in the debate, was not shy away from comparing the Nord Stream pipeline with a "new German-Soviet pact" in conjunction with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the purpose of the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically highly sensitive.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply by supporting this Russian project.
However, this is at the expense of de-empowering European energy, as the project has struck a rift between Western and Eastern Europeans.
In less than five years, Russia has completed its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, Western countries, which have strong gas consumption and tend to their gas reserves.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in an organic way," Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon confirmed at the inauguration of the gas pipeline, pointing out the extent to which the large gas contracts are also important from the political and economic side.
All this explains the broad smile of the Gazprom managers, who are numerous in Lubmin, regarding the gas supply.
The construction of this gas transmission line is also an outstanding technique.
The underwater line is made of steel with concrete cladding, which is intended to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the seabed, in about 200 m depth.
During its construction, minefields dating from the Second World War had to be diverted.
"About a hundred mines had to be removed or destroyed cautiously," Jens Müller, a spokesman for Nord Stream, said.
In addition, intensified measures had to be taken to protect the fauna and flora.
The line is a long line of metal, as heavy as 242 Eiffel towers, which is not interrupted by anything along the entire length: neither by valves, nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project managers distanced themselves from it, as the Swedes had little interest in seeing a Russian state-owned company settle permanently at the level of their coasts.
"In the event of an accident, we will close the gas passage in less than a minute," said Jens Müller.
In the case of a leak, the gas in the gas transmission line thus escapes into the air.
However, this case is considered unlikely by the designers, as the weld seams were estimated to have a resistance of one leak per 100,000 years.
State monitoring of the gas transmission line is ensured by both an underwater robot, which is controlled for external observation purposes by a seagoing vessel, and by a device circulating inside the gas transmission line.
It has the shape of a cigar, mi<0xCE><0xB2>t one meter in diameter, is introduced into the interior of the pipeline and moved through the gas pressure.
After three full days of movement through the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides the most accurate information on possible deformations of the metal when it arrives.
The gas transmission line was designed to operate for fifty years without having to undergo even the slightest repair.
The gas circulation is easily ensured by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the entry point, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
However, management remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Furthermore, the German companies E. ON and BASF (at 15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gas Union and the French company group GDF Suez (at 9% each) are affiliated here.
These five companies have formed a joint venture called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas transmission line.
It is headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased to this company the entire capacity of its gas transport, namely on a renewable twenty-year contract.
“Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how large the real transport gas volume falls out,” said Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the gas transmission line was secured to 30% by shareholders and to 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of work should amount to 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
However, the minority shareholders are hesitant to recover their expenses, as Gazprom alone bears the liability risk.
The gas pipeline is located on a sandy, pine forested stretch of coastline at Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5-metre-high valves form the gas outlets.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other key figures of the incoming gas before it is forwarded to the German gas transmission lines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been supplied with one million cubic meters of Russian gas per passing hour.
At full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Created by an Italian company about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to give writing a new style.
It has a flair of adventure, hours spent in candlelight writing.
Moleskine’s notebook is easily recognizable, with its black, rectangular envelope, its rubber band, the egg-shell-colored sides, as ageed over time.
However, the Moleskine notebook as it is known today was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which is based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a distinguished design notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then specialist consultant of the company, is responsible for the market launch of the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an old-fashioned production technique called Mole Skin, which refers to a cotton varnish used, for example, for covers of upholstered benches.
This type of notebook was in high demand among writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has revived an old and almost forgotten object that was considered to be an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century," explains Maria Sebregondi, now brand manager at Modo Modo.
Success comes.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% and established with a sales of 12.7 million units.
This is far from the usual production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to create a phantom image of the buyers, as the notebook delights businessmen as well as students and professionals alike.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultured and open-minded customers.
The small Italian company, which initially had 12 employees, now employs over 100 people and has two offices since 2008, one in Milan and the other in New York.
The company sells its notebooks in bookstores, on internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques in the city centers and understands how to enforce its identity.
“We have followed the spirit of time and its new writing needs, which persist despite the booming e-mails,” said Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural trait is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exhibition called "Detour", in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival, the company also launched a leopard print envelope.
Moleskine benefited from its success and this cultural time spirit and knew how to diversify its products: bags, calendars, fillers, computer cases... The brand has the full range of articles.
In the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today’s Syntegra Capital, thus opening a new chapter in Moleskine’s history.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers remain at such a high level?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
Today begins the "15th week of work for the disabled".
Despite a targeted public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for persons with disabilities is always twice as high as the average: 19% compared to 9% of the total population.
Disappointing?
"No," said <0xC3><0x89>ric Blanchet, director-general of the Adapt association, which organizes the "Work Week for the Disabled."
"The progress achieved in 15 years is considerable."
"The unemployment rate at that time was not double, but three times as high."
"Nevertheless, there is still a great deal to be done."
However, it must be said that there are still many obstacles for disabled unemployed people before they get a job.
It is more common for the elderly: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualifications: 80% of them do not have a diploma and there are only 10,000 disabled among the 2.3 million students with higher education degrees.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% among the disabled compared to 38% on average.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to re-enter the workforce and that make up the "core of the problem", says Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992 that helps companies to recruit disabled workers.
So much for the actual brakes.
The unspoken remains, the attitudes that are certainly developing, but are still slowly developing.
A study conducted in April by the association IMS-Entreprendre for the magazine La Cité indicated that the managers interviewed have "a weak level of knowledge about disabled people", which is "overrepresented" by people in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually under-represented".
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go to achieve the employment target of 6% of disabled workers set out in a 1987 law.
These last-mentioned figures from 2008 refer to a quotient of 2.6%.
“We are now at around 3%,” said Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the organization tasked with collecting contributions from companies that violated this law.
Evidence: The number of "fees payable" establishments decreased from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros) and the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011.
"The 2005 law, which provides for increases in contributions, created strong pressure on companies," said Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects a real insight, especially among the large groups of companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of workplaces between 20 and 49 employees employ people with disabilities, while companies with 100 to 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard: "What a fortune"
Even before they faced the Blue Tuesday evenings (20:45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had not concealed the pleasure that the friendship game brought them.
It would be too far-fetched to claim there had been a secret agreement between them, but the picture speaks symbolic volumes.
Sitting side by side on the stage of the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard could have made peace.
Five months after the temperamental gesture of his attacking player against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had reaped nothing but praise regarding his person.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian".
"I want to look forward," assures the native Liller in turn.
As for the contrast between his portrayal in club and national elf"It is a unit that justifies everything."
"In Lille I am all year round, which is not the case in Belgium".
"It's time for me to go to the start".
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, brought on Friday evening against Romania regarding the match against France to finally "gloss".
However, without omitting the note of "pleasure".
He has led the French national team since the age of 7, and he led his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been supported,” he said.
This inevitably contributes to further amplifying the "unique" character of this encounter.
"Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he said.
"We just walked over the road".
"To be allowed to play against them means great luck!"
Leekens, on the other hand, sounded "pride" with good-naturedness.
"Proud to be a gala match."
"Pride" also to confirm - in its capacity as"neighbors" - that France "has again become a team at a very high level", and that little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
“Laurent Blanc has done a damn good job,” he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European Championship, the technician is very likely to share the plane with the Blues (the French national elf) ... towards Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians come out big," he stressed.
"We're in the process of planning one thing, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You will notice that in the upcoming games". The game against France included.
Portugal very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento looks with great optimism at the back against Bosnia (22:00) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
Both teams were lacking in practicality.
"At the end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy team and above all a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that "La Selec<0xC3><0xA7>ao", his national elf, for which he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
For Portugal, that means only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a match to play, and to serve an opponent, namely Bosnia.
In view of the draw (0-0) on Friday in Zenica's Hell, it seems obvious that the dice have not fallen yet.
Portugal clearly dominated the game for more than an hour, but the team was not able to stamp the matter with such an important stamp that would have taken the pressure away from it.
"This is a good result, but it carries some risk, as we have not achieved an outward goal."
At home, however, in their brightly shining Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to beat themselves in front of an audience that is equally hot on the game, even if the game was announced as "very close", of course, said the optimistic but clear-sighted Bento.
"We are expecting a very tight match, but we are absolutely convinced that we can win the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance to be at the 2012 European Championships," said Queiroz's successor.
The tie in Bosnia on Friday forces the Portuguese to score and win a goal.
A tie may already suffice for Bosnians, who also need a goal.
“This is a good result, but it carries some risk, as we have not achieved an outgoing goal,” Bento regrets.
"We will compete against a team that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities," he added.
As already in Zenica, the Portuguese had the intention of exerting maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the very beginning, in order "to give them no time to think."
A good idea, provided that it is implemented this time.
